Preface ()Ten years ago I completed the manuscript of Gender Troubleand sent itto Routledge for publication.I did not know that the text would haveas wide an audience as it has had,nor did I know that it would consti-tute a provocative “intervention”in feminist theory or be cited as oneof the founding texts of queer theory.The life of the text has exceededmy intentions,and that is surely in part the result of the changing con-text of its reception.As I wrote it,I understood myself to be in anembattled and oppositional relation to certain forms of feminism,evenas I understood the text to be part of feminism itself.I was writing inthe tradition of immanent critique that seeks to provoke critical exam-ination of the basic vocabulary of the movement of thought to which itbelongs.There was and remains warrant for such a mode of criticismand to distinguish between self-criticism that promises a more democ-ratic and inclusive life for the movement and criticism that seeks toundermine it altogether.Of course,it is always possible to misread theformer as the latter,but I would hope that that will not be done in thecase of Gender Trouble.In 1989 I was most concerned to criticize a pervasive heterosexualassumption in feminist literary theory.I sought to counter those viewsthat made presumptions about the limits and propriety of gender andrestricted the meaning of gender to received notions of masculinity and femininity.It was and remains my view that any feminist theory

that restricts the meaning of gender in the presuppositions of its ownpractice sets up exclusionary gender norms within feminism,oftenwith homophobic consequences.It seemed to me,and continues toseem,that feminism ought to be careful not to idealize certain expres-sions of gender that,in turn,produce new forms of hierarchy andexclusion.In particular,I opposed those regimes of truth that stipulat-ed that certain kinds of gendered expressions were found to be false orderivative,and others,true and original.The point was not to pre-scribe a new gendered way of life that might then serve as a model forreaders of the text.Rather,the aim of the text was to open up the fieldof possibility for gender without dictating which kinds of possibilitiesought to be realized.One might wonder what use “opening up possi-bilities”finally is,but no one who has understood what it is to live inthe social world as what is “impossible,”illegible,unrealizable,unreal,and illegitimate is likely to pose that question.Gender Troublesought to uncover the ways in which the very think-ing of what is possible in gendered life is foreclosed by certain habitualand violent presumptions.The text also sought to undermine any andall efforts to wield a discourse of truth to delegitimate minority gen-dered and sexual practices.This doesn’t mean that all minority prac-tices are to be condoned or celebrated,but it does mean that we oughtto be able to think them before we come to any kinds of conclusionsabout them.What worried me most were the ways that the panic in theface of such practices rendered them unthinkable.Is the breakdown ofgender binaries,for instance,so monstrous,so frightening,that it mustbe held to be definitionally impossible and heuristically precludedfrom any effort to think gender?Some of these kinds of presumptions were found in what wascalled “French Feminism”at the time,and they enjoyed great populari-ty among literary scholars and some social theorists.Even as I opposed what I took to be the heterosexism at the core ofsexual difference fundamentalism,I also drew from French poststruc-turalism to make my points.My work in Gender Troubleturned out to be

one of cultural translation.Poststructuralist theory was brought to bearon U.S.theories of gender and the political predicaments of feminism.Ifin some of its guises,poststructuralism appears as a formalism,alooffrom questions of social context and political aim,that has not been thecase with its more recent American appropriations.Indeed,my pointwas not to “apply”poststructuralism to feminism,but to subject thosetheories to a specifically feminist reformulation.Whereas some defend-ers of poststructuralist formalism express dismay at the avowedly “the-matic”orientation it receives in works such as Gender Trouble,thecritiques of poststructuralism within the cultural Left have expressedstrong skepticism toward the claim that anything politically progressivecan come of its premises.In both accounts,however,poststructuralismis considered something unified,pure,and monolithic.In recent years,however,that theory,or set of theories,has migrated into gender andsexuality studies,postcolonial and race studies.It has lost the formalismof its earlier instance and acquired a new and transplanted life in thedomain of cultural theory.There are continuing debates about whethermy own work or the work of Homi K.Bhabha,Gayatri ChakravortySpivak,or Slavoj Zˇizˇek belongs to cultural studies or critical theory,butperhaps such questions simply show that the strong distinction betweenthe two enterprises has broken down.There will be theorists who claimthat all of the above belong to cultural studies,and there will be culturalstudies practitioners who define themselves against all manner of theory(although not,significantly,Stuart Hall,one of the founders of culturalstudies in Britain).But both sides of the debate sometimes miss thepoint that the face of theory has changed precisely through its culturalappropriations.There is a new venue for theory,necessarily impure,where it emerges in and as the very event of cultural translation.This isnot the displacement of theory by historicism,nor a simple historiciza-tion of theory that exposes the contingent limits of its more generaliz-able claims.It is,rather,the emergence of theory at the site wherecultural horizons meet,where the demand for translation is acute andits promise of success,uncertain.

Gender Troubleis rooted in “French Theory,”which is itself a curiousAmerican construction.Only in the United States are so many disparatetheories joined together as if they formed some kind of unity.Althoughthe book has been translated into several languages and has had an espe-cially strong impact on discussions of gender and politics in Germany,itwill emerge in France,if it finally does,much later than in other coun-tries.I mention this to underscore that the apparent Francocentrism ofthe text is at a significant distance from France and from the life of the-ory in France.Gender Troubletends to read together,in a syncretic vein,various French intellectuals (Lévi-Strauss,Foucault,Lacan,Kristeva,Wittig) who had few alliances with one another and whose readers inFrance rarely,if ever,read one another.Indeed,the intellectual promis-cuity of the text marks it precisely as American and makes it foreign to aFrench context.So does its emphasis on the Anglo-American sociologi-cal and anthropological tradition of “gender”studies,which is distinctfrom the discourse of “sexual difference”derived from structuralistinquiry.If the text runs the risk of Eurocentrism in the U.S.,it hasthreatened an “Americanization”of theory in France for those fewFrench publishers who have considered it.1Of course,“French Theory”is not the only language of this text.Itemerges from a long engagement with feminist theory,with the debateson the socially constructed character of gender,with psychoanalysis andfeminism,with Gayle Rubin’s extraordinary work on gender,sexuality,and kinship,Esther Newton’s groundbreaking work on drag,MoniqueWittig’s brilliant theoretical and fictional writings,and with gay andlesbian perspectives in the humanities.Whereas many feminists in the1980s assumed that lesbianism meets feminism in lesbian-feminism,Gender Troublesought to refuse the notion that lesbian practice instanti-ates feminist theory,and set up a more troubled relation between thetwo terms.Lesbianism in this text does not represent a return to whatis most important about being a woman;it does not consecrate femi-ninity or signal a gynocentric world.Lesbianism is not the erotic con-

summation of a set of political beliefs (sexuality and belief are related ina much more complex fashion,and very often at odds with one anoth-er).Instead,the text asks,how do non-normative sexual practices callinto question the stability of gender as a category of analysis? How docertain sexual practices compel the question:what is a woman,what isa man? If gender is no longer to be understood as consolidated throughnormative sexuality,then is there a crisis of gender that is specific toqueer contexts?The idea that sexual practice has the power to destabilize genderemerged from my reading of Gayle Rubin’s “The Traffic in Women”andsought to establish that normative sexuality fortifies normative gender.Briefly,one is a woman,according to this framework,to the extentthat one functions as one within the dominant heterosexual frame andto call the frame into question is perhaps to lose something of one’ssense of place in gender.I take it that this is the first formulation of“gender trouble”in this text.I sought to understand some of the terrorand anxiety that some people suffer in “becoming gay,”the fear of los-ing one’s place in gender or of not knowing who one will be if onesleeps with someone of the ostensibly “same”gender.This constitutes acertain crisis in ontology experienced at the level of both sexuality andlanguage.This issue has become more acute as we consider variousnew forms of gendering that have emerged in light of transgenderismand transsexuality,lesbian and gay parenting,new butch and femmeidentities.When and why,for instance,do some butch lesbians whobecome parents become “dads”and others become “moms”? What about the notion,suggested by Kate Bornstein,that a trans-sexual cannot be described by the noun of “woman”or “man,”but mustbe approached through active verbs that attest to the constant transfor-mation which “is”the new identity or,indeed,the “in-betweenness”that puts the being of gendered identity into question? Although somelesbians argue that butches have nothing to do with “being a man,”oth-ers insist that their butchness is or was only a route to a desired status

as a man.These paradoxes have surely proliferated in recent years,offering evidence of a kind of gender trouble that the text itself did notanticipate.2But what is the link between gender and sexuality that I sought to underscore? Certainly,I do not mean to claim that forms of sexualpractice produce certain genders,but only that under conditions ofnormative heterosexuality,policing gender is sometimes used as a wayof securing heterosexuality.Catharine MacKinnon offers a formulationof this problem that resonates with my own at the same time that thereare,I believe,crucial and important differences between us.She writes:Stopped as an attribute of a person,sex inequality takes the form ofgender;moving as a relation between people,it takes the form ofsexuality.Gender emerges as the congealed form of the sexualizationof inequality between men and women.3In this view,sexual hierarchy produces and consolidates gender.It isnot heterosexual normativity that produces and consolidates gender,but the gender hierarchy that is said to underwrite heterosexual rela-tions.If gender hierarchy produces and consolidates gender,and if gen-der hierarchy presupposes an operative notion of gender,then gender iswhat causes gender,and the formulation culminates in tautology.It maybe that MacKinnon wants merely to outline the self-reproducing mech-anism of gender hierarchy,but this is not what she has said.Is “gender hierarchy”sufficient to explain the conditions for the production of gender? To what extent does gender hierarchy serve a more or less compulsory heterosexuality,and how often aregender norms policed precisely in the service of shoring up heterosex-ual hegemony?Katherine Franke,a contemporary legal theorist,makes innovativeuse of both feminist and queer perspectives to note that by assumingthe primacy of gender hierarchy to the production of gender,MacKinnon also accepts a presumptively heterosexual model forthinking about sexuality.Franke offers an alternative model of gender

discrimination to MacKinnon’s,effectively arguing that sexual harass-ment is the paradigmatic allegory for the production of gender.Not alldiscrimination can be understood as harassment.The act of harassmentmay be one in which a person is “made”into a certain gender.But thereare others ways of enforcing gender as well.Thus,for Franke,it isimportant to make a provisional distinction between gender and sexu-al discrimination.Gay people,for instance,may be discriminatedagainst in positions of employment because they fail to “appear”inaccordance with accepted gendered norms.And the sexual harassmentof gay people may well take place not in the service of shoring up gen-der hierarchy,but in promoting gender normativity.Whereas MacKinnon offers a powerful critique of sexual harass-ment,she institutes a regulation of another kind:to have a gendermeans to have entered already into a heterosexual relationship of subor-dination.At an analytic level,she makes an equation that resonates withsome dominant forms of homophobic argument.One such view pre-scribes and condones the sexual ordering of gender,maintaining thatmen who are men will be straight,women who are women will bestraight.There is another set of views,Franke’s included,which offers acritique precisely of this form of gender regulation.There is thus a dif-ference between sexist and feminist views on the relation between gen-der and sexuality:the sexist claims that a woman only exhibits herwomanness in the act of heterosexual coitus in which her subordinationbecomes her pleasure (an essence emanates and is confirmed in the sex-ualized subordination of women);a feminist view argues that gendershould be overthrown,eliminated,or rendered fatally ambiguous pre-cisely because it is always a sign of subordination for women.The latteraccepts the power of the former’s orthodox description,accepts thatthe former’s description already operates as powerful ideology,butseeks to oppose it.I belabor this point because some queer theorists have drawn an analytic distinction between gender and sexuality,refusing a causalor structural link between them.This makes good sense from one

perspective:if what is meant by this distinction is that heterosexualnormativity ought notto order gender,and that such ordering ought tobe opposed,I am firmly in favor of this view.4If,however,what ismeant by this is that (descriptively speaking),there is no sexual regula-tion of gender,then I think an important,but not exclusive,dimensionof how homophobia works is going unrecognized by those who areclearly most eager to combat it.It is important for me to concede,however,that the performance of gender subversion can indicate noth-ing about sexuality or sexual practice.Gender can be renderedambiguous without disturbing or reorienting normative sexuality atall.Sometimes gender ambiguity can operate precisely to contain ordeflect non-normative sexual practice and thereby work to keep nor-mative sexuality intact.5Thus,no correlation can be drawn,forinstance,between drag or transgender and sexual practice,and the dis-tribution of hetero-,bi-,and homo-inclinations cannot be predictablymapped onto the travels of gender bending or changing.Much of my work in recent years has been devoted to clarifyingand revising the theory of performativity that is outlined in GenderTrouble.6It is difficult to say precisely what performativity is not onlybecause my own views on what “performativity”might mean havechanged over time,most often in response to excellent criticisms,7butbecause so many others have taken it up and given it their own formu-lations.I originally took my clue on how to read the performativity ofgender from Jacques Derrida’s reading of Kafka’s “Before the Law.”There the one who waits for the law,sits before the door of the law,attributes a certain force to the law for which one waits.The anticipa-tion of an authoritative disclosure of meaning is the means by whichthat authority is attributed and installed:the anticipation conjures itsobject.I wondered whether we do not labor under a similar expecta-tion concerning gender,that it operates as an interior essence thatmight be disclosed,an expectation that ends up producing the veryphenomenon that it anticipates.In the first instance,then,the perfor-mativity of gender revolves around this metalepsis,the way in which

the anticipation of a gendered essence produces that which it posits asoutside itself.Secondly,performativity is not a singular act,but a repe-tition and a ritual,which achieves its effects through its naturalizationin the context of a body,understood,in part,as a culturally sustainedtemporal duration.8Several important questions have been posed to this doctrine,andone seems especially noteworthy to mention here.The view that genderis performative sought to show that what we take to be an internalessence of gender is manufactured through a sustained set of acts,posit-ed through the gendered stylization of the body.In this way,it showedthat what we take to be an “internal”feature of ourselves is one that weanticipate and produce through certain bodily acts,at an extreme,anhallucinatory effect of naturalized gestures.Does this mean that every-thing that is understood as “internal”about the psyche is therefore evac-uated,and that internality is a false metaphor? Although Gender Troubleclearly drew upon the metaphor of an internal psyche in its early discus-sion of gender melancholy,that emphasis was not brought forward intothe thinking of performativity itself.9Both The Psychic Life of Powerandseveral of my recent articles on psychoanalytic topics have sought tocome to terms with this problem,what many have seen as a problematicbreak between the early and later chapters of this book.Although Iwould deny that all of the internal world of the psyche is but an effect ofa stylized set of acts,I continue to think that it is a significant theoreticalmistake to take the “internality”of the psychic world for granted.Certain features of the world,including people we know and lose,dobecome “internal”features of the self,but they are transformed throughthat interiorization,and that inner world,as the Kleinians call it,is con-stituted precisely as a consequence of the interiorizations that a psycheperforms.This suggests that there may well be a psychic theory of per-formativity at work that calls for greater exploration.Although this text does not answer the question of whether themateriality of the body is fully constructed,that has been the focus ofmuch of my subsequent work,which I hope will prove clarifying for the

reader.10The question of whether or not the theory of performativitycan be transposed onto matters of race has been explored by severalscholars.11I would note here not only that racial presumptions invari-ably underwrite the discourse on gender in ways that need to be madeexplicit,but that race and gender ought not to be treated as simpleanalogies.I would therefore suggest that the question to ask is notwhether the theory of performativity is transposable onto race,butwhat happens to the theory when it tries to come to grips with race.Many of these debates have centered on the status of “construction,”whether race is constructed in the same way as gender.My view is thatno single account of construction will do,and that these categoriesalways work as background for one another,and they often find theirmost powerful articulation through one another.Thus,the sexualizationof racial gender norms calls to be read through multiple lenses at once,and the analysis surely illuminates the limits of gender as an exclusivecategory of analysis.12Although I’ve enumerated some of the academic traditions anddebates that have animated this book,it is not my purpose to offer afull apologia in these brief pages.There is one aspect of the conditionsof its production that is not always understood about the text:it wasproduced not merely from the academy,but from convergent socialmovements of which I have been a part,and within the context of alesbian and gay community on the east coast of the United States inwhich I lived for fourteen years prior to the writing of this book.Despite the dislocation of the subject that the text performs,there is aperson here:I went to many meetings,bars,and marches and sawmany kinds of genders,understood myself to be at the crossroads ofsome of them,and encountered sexuality at several of its culturaledges.I knew many people who were trying to find their way in themidst of a significant movement for sexual recognition and freedom,and felt the exhilaration and frustration that goes along with being apart of that movement both in its hopefulness and internal dissension.At the same time that I was ensconced in the academy,I was also living

a life outside those walls,and though Gender Troubleis an academicbook,it began,for me,with a crossing-over,sitting on RehobothBeach,wondering whether I could link the different sides of my life.That I can write in an autobiographical mode does not,I think,relo-cate this subject that I am,but perhaps it gives the reader a sense ofsolace that there is someone here (I will suspend for the moment theproblem that this someone is given in language).It has been one of the most gratifying experiences for me that thetext continues to move outside the academy to this day.At the same time that the book was taken up by Queer Nation,and some of itsreflections on the theatricality of queer self-presentation resonatedwith the tactics of Act Up,it was among the materials that also helpedto prompt members of the American Psychoanalytic Association andthe American Psychological Association to reassess some of their cur-rent doxa on homosexuality.The questions of performative genderwere appropriated in different ways in the visual arts,at Whitney exhi-bitions,and at the Otis School for the Arts in Los Angeles,among oth-ers.Some of its formulations on the subject of “women”and therelation between sexuality and gender also made its way into feministjurisprudence and antidiscrimination legal scholarship in the work ofVicki Schultz,Katherine Franke,and Mary Jo Frug.In turn,I have been compelled to revise some of my positions inGender Troubleby virtue of my own political engagements.In the book,Itend to conceive of the claim of “universality”in exclusive negative andexclusionary terms.However,I came to see the term has importantstrategic use precisely as a non-substantial and open-ended category as Iworked with an extraordinary group of activists first as a board mem-ber and then as board chair of the International Gay and Lesbian HumanRights Commission (1994–7),an organization that represents sexualminorities on a broad range of human rights issues.There I came tounderstand how the assertion of universality can be proleptic and per-formative,conjuring a reality that does not yet exist,and holding outthe possibility for a convergence of cultural horizons that have not yet

met.Thus,I arrived at a second view of universality in which it isdefined as a future-oriented labor of cultural translation.13Morerecently,I have been compelled to relate my work to political theoryand,once again,to the concept of universality in a co-authored bookthat I am writing with Ernesto Laclau and Slavoj Zˇizˇekon the theory ofhegemony and its implications for a theoretically activist Left (to bepublished by Verso in 2000).Another practical dimension of my thinking has taken place inrelationship to psychoanalysis as both a scholarly and clinical enter-prise.I am currently working with a group of progressive psychoana-lytic therapists on a new journal,Studies in Gender and Sexuality,thatseeks to bring clinical and scholarly work into productive dialogue onquestions of sexuality,gender,and culture.Both critics and friends of Gender Troublehave drawn attention tothe difficulty of its style.It is no doubt strange,and maddening tosome,to find a book that is not easily consumed to be “popular”according to academic standards.The surprise over this is perhapsattributable to the way we underestimate the reading public,its capac-ity and desire for reading complicated and challenging texts,when thecomplication is not gratuitous,when the challenge is in the service ofcalling taken-for-granted truths into question,when the taken forgrantedness of those truths is,indeed,oppressive.I think that style is a complicated terrain,and not one that we uni-laterally choose or control with the purposes we consciously intend.Fredric Jameson made this clear in his early book on Sartre.Certainly,one can practice styles,but the styles that become available to you arenot entirely a matter of choice.Moreover,neither grammar nor styleare politically neutral.Learning the rules that govern intelligiblespeech is an inculcation into normalized language,where the price ofnot conforming is the loss of intelligibility itself.As Drucilla Cornell,in the tradition of Adorno,reminds me:there is nothing radical aboutcommon sense.It would be a mistake to think that received grammaris the best vehicle for expressing radical views,given the constraints

Gender Trouble

that grammar imposes upon thought,indeed,upon the thinkable itself.But formulations that twist grammar or that implicitly call into ques-tion the subject-verb requirements of propositional sense are clearlyirritating for some.They produce more work for their readers,andsometimes their readers are offended by such demands.Are those whoare offended making a legitimate request for “plain speaking”or doestheir complaint emerge from a consumer expectation of intellectuallife? Is there,perhaps,a value to be derived from such experiences oflinguistic difficulty? If gender itself is naturalized through grammaticalnorms,as Monique Wittig has argued,then the alteration of gender atthe most fundamental epistemic level will be conducted,in part,through contesting the grammar in which gender is given.The demand for lucidity forgets the ruses that motor the ostensi-bly “clear”view.Avital Ronell recalls the moment in which Nixonlooked into the eyes of the nation and said,“let me make one thingperfectly clear”and then proceeded to lie.What travels under the sign of “clarity,”and what would be the price of failing to deploy a cer-tain critical suspicion when the arrival of lucidity is announced? Whodevises the protocols of “clarity”and whose interests do they serve?What is foreclosed by the insistence on parochial standards of trans-parency as requisite for all communication? What does “transparency”keep obscure?I grew up understanding something of the violence of gendernorms:an uncle incarcerated for his anatomically anomalous body,deprived of family and friends,living out his days in an “institute”in theKansas prairies;gay cousins forced to leave their homes because of theirsexuality,real and imagined;my own tempestuous coming out at theage of 16;and a subsequent adult landscape of lost jobs,lovers,andhomes.All of this subjected me to strong and scarring condemnationbut,luckily,did not prevent me from pursuing pleasure and insisting ona legitimating recognition for my sexual life.It was difficult to bring thisviolence into view precisely because gender was so taken for granted atthe same time that it was violently policed.It was assumed either to be

xix

Preface 1999




a natural manifestation of sex or a cultural constant that no humanagency could hope to revise.I also came to understand something of theviolence of the foreclosed life,the one that does not get named as “liv-ing,”the one whose incarceration implies a suspension of life,or a sus-tained death sentence.The dogged effort to “denaturalize”gender in thistext emerges,I think,from a strong desire both to counter the norma-tive violence implied by ideal morphologies of sex and to uproot thepervasive assumptions about natural or presumptive heterosexualitythat are informed by ordinary and academic discourses on sexuality.Thewriting of this denaturalization was not done simply out of a desire toplay with language or prescribe theatrical antics in the place of “real”politics,as some critics have conjectured (as if theatre and politics arealways distinct).It was done from a desire to live,to make life possible,and to rethink the possible as such.What would the world have to belike for my uncle to live in the company of family,friends,or extendedkinship of some other kind? How must we rethink the ideal morpholog-ical constraints upon the human such that those who fail to approximatethe norm are not condemned to a death within life?14Some readers have asked whether Gender Troubleseeks to expand therealm of gender possibilities for a reason.They ask,for what purposeare such new configurations of gender devised,and how ought we tojudge among them? The question often involves a prior premise,name-ly,that the text does not address the normative or prescriptive dimen-sion of feminist thought.“Normative”clearly has at least two meaningsin this critical encounter,since the word is one I use often,mainly todescribe the mundane violence performed by certain kinds of genderideals.I usually use “normative”in a way that is synonymous with “per-taining to the norms that govern gender.”But the term “normative”alsopertains to ethical justification,how it is established,and what concreteconsequences proceed therefrom.One critical question posed of GenderTroublehas been:how do we proceed to make judgments on how genderis to be lived on the basis of the theoretical descriptions offered here? Itis not possible to oppose the “normative”forms of gender without at the

same time subscribing to a certain normative view of how the genderedworld ought to be.I want to suggest,however,that the positive norma-tive vision of this text,such as it is,does not and cannot take the form ofa prescription:“subvert gender in the way that I say,and life will begood.”Those who make such prescriptions or who are willing to decidebetween subversive and unsubversive expressions of gender,base theirjudgments on a description.Gender appears in this or that form,andthen a normative judgment is made about those appearances and onthe basis of what appears.But what conditions the domain of appear-ance for gender itself? We may be tempted to make the following dis-tinction:a descriptiveaccount of gender includes considerations of whatmakes gender intelligible,an inquiry into its conditions of possibility,whereas a normativeaccount seeks to answer the question of whichexpressions of gender are acceptable,and which are not,supplyingpersuasive reasons to distinguish between such expressions in this way.The question,however,of what qualifies as “gender”is itself already aquestion that attests to a pervasively normative operation of power,afugitive operation of “what will be the case”under the rubric of “whatis the case.”Thus,the very description of the field of gender is no senseprior to,or separable from,the question of its normative operation.I am not interested in delivering judgments on what distinguishesthe subversive from the unsubversive.Not only do I believe that suchjudgments cannot be made out of context,but that they cannot bemade in ways that endure through time (“contexts”are themselvesposited unities that undergo temporal change and expose their essen-tial disunity).Just as metaphors lose their metaphoricity as they con-geal through time into concepts,so subversive performances alwaysrun the risk of becoming deadening cliches through their repetitionand,most importantly,through their repetition within commodityculture where “subversion”carries market value.The effort to namethe criterion for subversiveness will always fail,and ought to.So whatis at stake in using the term at all?

What continues to concern me most is the following kinds ofquestions:what will and will not constitute an intelligible life,andhow do presumptions about normative gender and sexuality deter-mine in advance what will qualify as the “human”and the “livable”? Inother words,how do normative gender presumptions work to delimitthe very field of description that we have for the human? What is themeans by which we come to see this delimiting power,and what arethe means by which we transform it?The discussion of drag that Gender Troubleoffers to explain the con-structed and performative dimension of gender is not precisely an exam-pleof subversion.It would be a mistake to take it as the paradigm ofsubversive action or,indeed,as a model for political agency.The point israther different.If one thinks that one sees a man dressed as a woman ora woman dressed as a man,then one takes the first term of each of thoseperceptions as the “reality”of gender:the gender that is introducedthrough the simile lacks “reality,”and is taken to constitute an illusoryappearance.In such perceptions in which an ostensible reality is cou-pled with an unreality,we think we know what the reality is,and takethe secondary appearance of gender to be mere artifice,play,falsehood,and illusion.But what is the sense of “gender reality”that founds thisperception in this way? Perhaps we think we know what the anatomy ofthe person is (sometimes we do not,and we certainly have not appreci-ated the variation that exists at the level of anatomical description).Orwe derive that knowledge from the clothes that the person wears,orhow the clothes are worn.This is naturalized knowledge,even though itis based on a series of cultural inferences,some of which are highlyerroneous.Indeed,if we shift the example from drag to transsexuality,then it is no longer possible to derive a judgment about stable anatomyfrom the clothes that cover and articulate the body.That body may bepreoperative,transitional,or postoperative;even “seeing”the body maynot answer the question:for what are the categories through which one sees?The moment in which one’s staid and usual cultural perceptions fail,




xxiii

when one cannot with surety read the body that one sees,is preciselythe moment when one is no longer sure whether the body encounteredis that of a man or a woman.The vacillation between the categoriesitself constitutes the experience of the body in question.When such categories come into question,the realityof gender isalso put into crisis:it becomes unclear how to distinguish the real fromthe unreal.And this is the occasion in which we come to understandthat what we take to be “real,”what we invoke as the naturalizedknowledge of gender is,in fact,a changeable and revisable reality.Callit subversive or call it something else.Although this insight does not initself constitute a political revolution,no political revolution is possi-ble without a radical shift in one’s notion of the possible and the real.And sometimes this shift comes as a result of certain kinds of practicesthat precede their explicit theorization,and which prompt a rethink-ing of our basic categories:what is gender,how is it produced andreproduced,what are its possibilities? At this point,the sedimentedand reified field of gender “reality”is understood as one that might bemade differently and,indeed,less violently.The point of this text is not to celebrate drag as the expression of atrue and model gender (even as it is important to resist the belittlingof drag that sometimes takes place),but to show that the naturalizedknowledge of gender operates as a preemptive and violent circum-scription of reality.To the extent the gender norms (ideal dimorphism,heterosexual complementarity of bodies,ideals and rule of proper andimproper masculinity and femininity,many of which are underwrittenby racial codes of purity and taboos against miscegenation) establishwhat will and will not be intelligibly human,what will and will not beconsidered to be “real,”they establish the ontological field in whichbodies may be given legitimate expression.If there is a positive nor-mative task in Gender Trouble,it is to insist upon the extension of thislegitimacy to bodies that have been regarded as false,unreal,and unin-telligible.Drag is an example that is meant to establish that “reality”is

not as fixed as we generally assume it to be.The purpose of the exam-ple is to expose the tenuousness of gender “reality”in order to counterthe violence performed by gender norms.In this text as elsewhere I have tried to understand what politi-cal agency might be,given that it cannot be isolated from the dynam-ics of power from which it is wrought.The iterability of performativi-ty is a theory of agency,one that cannot disavow power as thecondition of its own possibility.This text does not sufficiently explainperformativity in terms of its social,psychic,corporeal,and temporaldimensions.In some ways,the continuing work of that clarification,inresponse to numerous excellent criticisms,guides most of my subse-quent publications.Other concerns have emerged over this text in the last decade,andI have sought to answer them through various publications.On the sta-tus of the materiality of the body,I have offered a reconsideration andrevision of my views in Bodies that Matter.On the question of the neces-sity of the category of “women”for feminist analysis,I have revised andexpanded my views in “Contingent Foundations”to be found in thevolume I coedited with Joan W.Scott,Feminists Theorize the Political(Routledge,1993) and in the collectively authored Feminist Contentions(Routledge,1995).I do not believe that poststructuralism entails the death of autobio-graphical writing,but it does draw attention to the difficulty of the “I”to express itself through the language that is available to it.For this “I”that you read is in part a consequence of the grammar that governs theavailability of persons in language.I am not outside the language thatstructures me,but neither am I determined by the language that makesthis “I”possible.This is the bind of self-expression,as I understand it.What it means is that you never receive me apart from the grammarthat establishes my availability to you.If I treat that grammar as pellu-cid,then I fail to call attention precisely to that sphere of language thatestablishes and disestablishes intelligibility,and that would be precisely

to thwart my own project as I have described it to you here.I am nottrying to be difficult,but only to draw attention to a difficulty withoutwhich no “I”can appear.This difficulty takes on a specific dimension when approached froma psychoanalytic perspective.In my efforts to understand the opacity ofthe “I”in language,I have turned increasingly to psychoanalysis since thepublication of Gender Trouble.The usual effort to polarize the theory of the psyche from the theory of power seems to me to be counter-productive,for part of what is so oppressive about social forms of gen-der is the psychic difficulties they produce.Isought to consider theways in which Foucault and psychoanalysis might be thought together inThe Psychic Life of Power(Stanford,1997).I have also made use of psycho-analysis to curb the occasional voluntarism of my view of performativi-ty without thereby undermining a more general theory of agency.Gender Troublesometimes reads as if gender is simply a self-invention orthat the psychic meaning of a gendered presentation might be readdirectly off its surface.Both of those postulates have had to be refinedover time.Moreover,my theory sometimes waffles between under-standing performativity as linguistic and casting it as theatrical.I havecome to think that the two are invariably related,chiasmically so,andthat a reconsideration of the speech act as an instance of power invari-ably draws attention to both its theatrical and linguistic dimensions.InExcitable Speech,I sought to show that the speech act is at once per-formed (and thus theatrical,presented to an audience,subject to inter-pretation),and linguistic,inducing a set of effects through its impliedrelation to linguistic conventions.If one wonders how a linguistic theo-ry of the speech act relates to bodily gestures,one need only considerthat speech itself is a bodily act with specific linguistic consequences.Thus speech belongs exclusively neither to corporeal presentation norto language,and its status as word and deed is necessarily ambiguous.This ambiguity has consequences for the practice of coming out,for theinsurrectionary power of the speech act,for language as a condition ofboth bodily seduction and the threat of injury.

If I were to rewrite this book under present circumstances,I wouldinclude a discussion of transgender and intersexuality,the way that idealgender dimorphism works in both sorts of discourses,the different rela-tions to surgical intervention that these related concerns sustain.Iwould also include a discussion on racialized sexuality and,in particular,how taboos against miscegenation (and the romanticization of cross-racial sexual exchange) are essential to the naturalized and denaturalizedforms that gender takes.I continue to hope for a coalition of sexualminorities that will transcend the simple categories of identity,that willrefuse the erasure of bisexuality,that will counter and dissipate the vio-lence imposed by restrictive bodily norms.I would hope that such acoalition would be based on the irreducible complexity of sexuality andits implication in various dynamics of discursive and institutional power,and that no one will be too quick to reduce power to hierarchy and torefuse its productive political dimensions.Even as I think that gainingrecognition for one’s status as a sexual minority is a difficult task withinreigning discourses of law,politics,and language,I continue to considerit a necessity for survival.The mobilization of identity categories for thepurposes of politicization always remain threatened by the prospect ofidentity becoming an instrument of the power one opposes.That is noreason not to use,and be used,by identity.There is no political positionpurified of power,and perhaps that impurity is what produces agency asthe potential interruption and reversal of regulatory regimes.Thosewho are deemed “unreal”nevertheless lay hold of the real,a laying holdthat happens in concert,and a vital instability is produced by that per-formative surprise.This book is written then as part of the cultural lifeof a collective struggle that has had,and will continue to have,some suc-cess in increasing the possibilities for a livable life for those who live,ortry to live,on the sexual margins.15Judith ButlerBerkeley,CaliforniaJune,1999

Preface ()Contemporary feminist debates over the meanings of gender lead timeand again to a certain sense of trouble,as if the indeterminacy of gen-der might eventually culminate in the failure of feminism.Perhapstrouble need not carry such a negative valence.To make trouble was,within the reigning discourse of my childhood,something one shouldnever do precisely because that would get one introuble.The rebellionand its reprimand seemed to be caught up in the same terms,a phe-nomenon that gave rise to my first critical insight into the subtle ruse ofpower:the prevailing law threatened one with trouble,even put one introuble,all to keep one out of trouble.Hence,I concluded that troubleis inevitable and the task,how best to make it,what best way to be in it.As time went by,further ambiguities arrived on the critical scene.Inoted that trouble sometimes euphemized some fundamentally myste-rious problem usually related to the alleged mystery of all things femi-nine.I read Beauvoir who explained that to be a woman within theterms of a masculinist culture is to be a source of mystery andunknowability for men,and this seemed confirmed somehow when Iread Sartre for whom all desire,problematically presumed as hetero-sexual and masculine,was defined as trouble.For that masculine subjectof desire,trouble became a scandal with the sudden intrusion,theunanticipated agency,of a female “object”who inexplicably returns theglance,reverses the gaze,and contests the place and authority of the




masculine position.The radical dependency of the masculine subject onthe female “Other”suddenly exposes his autonomy as illusory.That par-ticular dialectical reversal of power,however,couldn’t quite hold myattention—although others surely did.Power seemed to be more thanan exchange between subjects or a relation of constant inversionbetween and subject and an Other;indeed,power appeared to operatein the production of that very binary frame for thinking about gender.Iasked,what configuration of power constructs the subject and theOther,that binary relation between “men”and “women,”and the inter-nal stability of those terms? What restriction is here at work? Are thoseterms untroubling only to the extent that they conform to a heterosex-ual matrix for conceptualizing gender and desire? What happens to thesubject and to the stability of gender categories when the epistemicregime of presumptive heterosexuality is unmasked as that which pro-duces and reifies these ostensible categories of ontology?But how can an epistemic/ontological regime be brought intoquestion? What best way to trouble the gender categories that supportgender hierarchy and compulsory heterosexuality? Consider the fate of“female trouble,”that historical configuration of a nameless femaleindisposition,which thinly veiled the notion that being female is a nat-ural indisposition.Serious as the medicalization of women’s bodies is,the term is also laughable,and laughter in the face of serious categoriesis indispensable for feminism.Without a doubt,feminism continues torequire its own forms of serious play.Female Troubleis also the title ofthe John Waters film that features Divine,the hero/heroine of Hair-sprayas well,whose impersonation of women implicitly suggests thatgender is a kind of persistent impersonation that passes as the real.Her/his performance destabilizes the very distinctions between thenatural and the artificial,depth and surface,inner and outer throughwhich discourse about genders almost always operates.Is drag the imi-tation of gender,or does it dramatize the signifying gestures throughwhich gender itself is established? Does being female constitute a “nat-ural fact”or a cultural performance,or is “naturalness”constituted

through discursively constrained performative acts that produce thebody through and within the categories of sex? Divine notwithstand-ing,gender practices within gay and lesbian cultures often thematize“the natural”in parodic contexts that bring into relief the performativeconstruction of an original and true sex.What other foundational cate-gories of identity—the binary of sex,gender,and the body—can beshown as productions that create the effect of the natural,the original,and the inevitable?To expose the foundational categories of sex,gender,and desire aseffects of a specific formation of power requires a form of criticalinquiry that Foucault,reformulating Nietzsche,designates as “gene-alogy.”A genealogical critique refuses to search for the origins of gen-der,the inner truth of female desire,a genuine or authentic sexualidentity that repression has kept from view;rather,genealogy investi-gates the political stakes in designating as an originand causethose iden-tity categories that are in fact the effectsof institutions,practices,discourses with multiple and diffuse points of origin.The task of thisinquiry is to center on—and decenter—such defining institutions:phallogocentrism and compulsory heterosexuality.Precisely because “female”no longer appears to be a stable notion,its meaning is as troubled and unfixed as “woman,”and because bothterms gain their troubled significations only as relational terms,thisinquiry takes as its focus gender and the relational analysis it suggests.Further,it is no longer clear that feminist theory ought to try to settlethe questions of primary identity in order to get on with the task ofpolitics.Instead,we ought to ask,what political possibilities are theconsequence of a radical critique of the categories of identity.Whatnew shape of politics emerges when identity as a common ground nolonger constrains the discourse on feminist politics? And to whatextent does the effort to locate a common identity as the foundationfor a feminist politics preclude a radical inquiry into the political con-struction and regulation of identity itself?*  *  *

This text is divided into three chapters that effect a critical genealogy ofgender categories in very different discursive domains.Chapter 1,“Subjects of Sex/Gender/Desire,”reconsiders the status of “women”asthe subject of feminism and the sex/gender distinction.Compulsoryheterosexuality and phallogocentrism are understood as regimes ofpower/discourse with often divergent ways of answering central ques-tion of gender discourse:how does language construct the categories ofsex? Does “the feminine”resist representation within language? Is lan-guage understood as phallogocentric (Luce Irigaray’s question)? Is “thefeminine”the only sex represented within a language that conflates thefemale and the sexual (Monique Wittig’s contention)? Where and howdo compulsory heterosexuality and phallogocentrism converge? Whereare the points of breakage between? How does language itself producethe fiction construction of “sex”that supports these various regimes ofpower? Within a language of presumptive heterosexuality,what sorts ofcontinuities are assumed to exist among sex,gender,and desire? Arethese terms discrete? What kinds of cultural practices produce subver-sive discontinuity and dissonance among sex,gender,and desire and callinto question their alleged relations?Chapter 2,“Prohibition,Psychoanalysis,and the Production of theHeterosexual Matrix,”offers a selective reading of structuralism,psy-choanalytic and feminist accounts of the incest taboo as the mechanismthat tries to enforce discrete and internally coherent gender identitieswithin a heterosexual frame.The question of homosexuality is,withinsome psychoanalytic discourse,invariably associated with forms ofcultural unintelligibility and,in the case of lesbianism,with the desexu-alization of the female body.On the other hand,the uses of psycho-analytic theory for an account of complex gender “identities”is pursuedthrough an analysis of identity,identification,and masquerade in JoanRiviere and other psychoanalytic literature.Once the incest taboo issubjected to Foucault’s critique of the repressive hypothesis in TheHistory of Sexuality,that prohibitive or juridical structure is shown both to instate compulsory heterosexuality within a masculinist sexual

economy and to enable a critical challenge to that economy.Is psycho-analysis an antifoundationalist inquiry that affirms the kind of sexualcomplexity that effectively deregulates rigid and hierarchical sexualcodes,or does it maintain an unacknowledged set of assumptions aboutthe foundations of identity that work in favor of those very hierarchies?The last chapter,“Subversive Bodily Acts,”begins with a criticalconsideration of the construction of the maternal body in Julia Kristevain order to show the implicit norms that govern the cultural intel-ligibility of sex and sexuality in her work.Although Foucault is engagedto provide a critique of Kristeva,a close examination of some ofFoucault’s own work reveals a problematic indifference to sexual dif-ference.His critique of the category of sex,however,provides aninsight into the regulatory practices of some contemporary medical fic-tions designed to designate univocal sex.Monique Wittig’s theory andfiction propose a “disintegration”of culturally constituted bodies,sug-gesting that morphology itself is a consequence of a hegemonic concep-tual scheme.The final section of this chapter,“Bodily Inscriptions,Performative Subversions,”considers the boundary and surface of bod-ies as politically constructed,drawing on the work of Mary Douglasand Julia Kristeva.As a strategy to denaturalize and resignify bodily cat-egories,I describe and propose a set of parodic practices based in a per-formative theory of gender acts that disrupt the categories of the body,sex,gender,and sexuality and occasion their subversive resignificationand proliferation beyond the binary frame.It seems that every text has more sources than it can reconstruct withinits own terms.These are sources that define and inform the very lan-guage of the text in ways that would require a thorough unraveling ofthe text itself to be understood,and of course there would be no guar-antee that that unraveling would ever stop.Although I have offered achildhood story to begin this preface,it is a fable irreducible to fact.Indeed,the purpose here more generally is to trace the way in whichgender fables establish and circulate the misnomer of natural facts.It is

clearly impossible to recover the origins of these essays,to locate thevarious moments that have enabled this text.The texts are assembled to facilitate a political convergence of feminism,gay and lesbian per-spectives on gender,and poststructuralist theory.Philosophy is thepredominant disciplinary mechanism that currently mobilizes thisauthor-subject,although it rarely if ever appears separated from otherdiscourses.This inquiry seeks to affirm those positions on the criticalboundaries of disciplinary life.The point is not to stay marginal,but toparticipate in whatever network or marginal zones is spawned fromother disciplinary centers and that,together,constitute a multiple dis-placement of those authorities.The complexity of gender requires aninterdisciplinary and postdisciplinary set of discourses in order to resistthe domestication of gender studies or women studies within the acade-my and to radicalize the notion of feminist critique.The writing of this text was made possible by a number of institu-tional and individual forms of support.The American Council ofLearned Societies provided a Recent Recipient of the Ph.D.Fellowshipfor the fall of 1987,and the School of Social Science at the Institute forAdvanced Study in Princeton provided fellowship,housing,andprovocative argumentation during the 1987–1988 academic year.TheGeorge Washington University Faculty Research Grant also supportedmy research during the summers of 1987 and 1988.Joan W.Scott hasbeen an invaluable and incisive critic throughout various stages of thismanuscript.Her commitment to a critical rethinking of the presupposi-tional terms of feminist politics has challenged and inspired me.The“Gender Seminar”assembled at the Institute for Advanced Study underJoan Scott’s direction helped me to clarify and elaborate my views byvirtue of the significant and provocative divisions in our collectivethinking.Hence,I thank Lila Abu-Lughod,Yasmine Ergas,DonnaHaraway,Evelyn Fox Keller,Dorinne Kondo,Rayna Rapp,CarrollSmith-Rosenberg,Louise Tilly.My students in the seminar “Gender,Identity,and Desire,”offered at Wesleyan University and at Yale in 1985and 1986,respectively,were indispensable for their willingness to




imagine alternatively gendered worlds.I also appreciate the variety ofcritical responses that I received on presentations of parts of this workfrom the Princeton Women’s Studies Colloquium,the HumanitiesCenter at Johns Hopkins University,the University of Notre Dame,theUniversity of Kansas,Amherst College,and the Yale University Schoolof Medicine.My acknowledgment also goes to Linda Singer,whose per-sistent radicalism has been invaluable,Sandra Bartky for her work andher timely words of encouragement,Linda Nicholson for her editorialand critical advice,and Linda Anderson for her acute political intu-itions.I also thank the following individuals,friends,and colleagueswho shaped and supported my thinking:Eloise Moore Aggar,Inés Azar,Peter Caws,Nancy F.Cott,Kathy Natanson,Lois Natanson,MauriceNatanson,Stacy Pies,Josh Shapiro,Margaret Soltan,Robert V.Stone,Richard Vann,and Eszti Votaw.I thank Sandra Schmidt for her fine workin helping to prepare this manuscript,and Meg Gilbert for her assis-tance.I also thank Maureen MacGrogan for encouraging this projectand others with her humor,patience,and fine editorial guidance.As before,I thank Wendy Owen for her relentless imagination,keen criticism,and for the provocation of her work.

3




assumed to be true about the category of women.For feminist theory,the development of a language that fully or adequately representswomen has seemed necessary to foster the political visibility ofwomen.This has seemed obviously important considering the perva-sive cultural condition in which women’s lives were either misrepre-sented or not represented at all.Recently,this prevailing conception of the relation between femi-nist theory and politics has come under challenge from within feministdiscourse.The very subject of women is no longer understood in stableor abiding terms.There is a great deal of material that not only ques-tions the viability of “the subject”as the ultimate candidate for repre-sentation or,indeed,liberation,but there is very little agreement afterall on what it is that constitutes,or ought to constitute,the category ofwomen.The domains of political and linguistic “representation”set outin advance the criterion by which subjects themselves are formed,with the result that representation is extended only to what can beacknowledged as a subject.In other words,the qualifications for beinga subject must first be met before representation can be extended.Foucault points out that juridical systems of power produce the sub-jects they subsequently come to represent.1 Juridical notions of powerappear to regulate political life in purely negative terms—that is,through the limitation,prohibition,regulation,control,and even “pro-tection”of individuals related to that political structure through thecontingent and retractable operation of choice.But the subjects regu-lated by such structures are,by virtue of being subjected to them,formed,defined,and reproduced in accordance with the requirementsof those structures.If this analysis is right,then the juridical formationof language and politics that represents women as “the subject”of fem-inism is itself a discursive formation and effect of a given version ofrepresentational politics.And the feminist subject turns out to be dis-cursively constituted by the very political system that is supposed tofacilitate its emancipation.This becomes politically problematic if thatsystem can be shown to produce gendered subjects along a differential

axis of domination or to produce subjects who are presumed to bemasculine.In such cases,an uncritical appeal to such a system for theemancipation of “women”will be clearly self-defeating.The question of “the subject”is crucial for politics,and for feministpolitics in particular,because juridical subjects are invariably producedthrough certain exclusionary practices that do not “show”once thejuridical structure of politics has been established.In other words,thepolitical construction of the subject proceeds with certain legitimatingand exclusionary aims,and these political operations are effectivelyconcealed and naturalized by a political analysis that takes juridicalstructures as their foundation.Juridical power inevitably “produces”what it claims merely to represent;hence,politics must be concernedwith this dual function of power:the juridical and the productive.Ineffect,the law produces and then conceals the notion of “a subjectbefore the law”2 in order to invoke that discursive formation as a natu-ralized foundational premise that subsequently legitimates that law’sown regulatory hegemony.It is not enough to inquire into how womenmight become more fully represented in language and politics.Feminist critique ought also to understand how the category of“women,”the subject of feminism,is produced and restrained by thevery structures of power through which emancipation is sought.Indeed,the question of women as the subject of feminism raisesthe possibility that there may not be a subject who stands “before”thelaw,awaiting representation in or by the law.Perhaps the subject,aswell as the invocation of a temporal “before,”is constituted by the lawas the fictive foundation of its own claim to legitimacy.The prevailingassumption of the ontological integrity of the subject before the lawmight be understood as the contemporary trace of the state of naturehypothesis,that foundationalist fable constitutive of the juridical struc-tures of classical liberalism.The performative invocation of a nonhis-torical “before”becomes the foundational premise that guarantees apresocial ontology of persons who freely consent to be governed and,thereby,constitute the legitimacy of the social contract.

Apart from the foundationalist fictions that support the notion ofthe subject,however,there is the political problem that feminismencounters in the assumption that the term women denotes a commonidentity.Rather than a stable signifier that commands the assent of thosewhom it purports to describe and represent,women,even in the plural,has become a troublesome term,a site of contest,a cause for anxiety.AsDenise Riley’s title suggests,Am I That Name? is a question produced bythe very possibility of the name’s multiple significations.3If one “is”awoman,that is surely not all one is;the term fails to be exhaustive,notbecause a pregendered “person”transcends the specific paraphernalia ofits gender,but because gender is not always constituted coherently orconsistently in different historical contexts,and because gender inter-sects with racial,class,ethnic,sexual,and regional modalities of discur-sively constituted identities.As a result,it becomes impossible toseparate out “gender”from the political and cultural intersections inwhich it is invariably produced and maintained.The political assumption that there must be a universal basis forfeminism,one which must be found in an identity assumed to existcross-culturally,often accompanies the notion that the oppression ofwomen has some singular form discernible in the universal or hege-monic structure of patriarchy or masculine domination.The notion ofa universal patriarchy has been widely criticized in recent years for itsfailure to account for the workings of gender oppression in the con-crete cultural contexts in which it exists.Where those various contextshave been consulted within such theories,it has been to find “exam-ples”or “illustrations”of a universal principle that is assumed from thestart.That form of feminist theorizing has come under criticism for itsefforts to colonize and appropriate non-Western cultures to supporthighly Western notions of oppression,but because they tend as well toconstruct a “Third World”or even an “Orient”in which gender oppres-sion is subtly explained as symptomatic of an essential,non-Westernbarbarism.The urgency of feminism to establish a universal status forpatriarchy in order to strengthen the appearance of feminism’s own

Gender Trouble

6




claims to be representative has occasionally motivated the shortcut to acategorial or fictive universality of the structure of domination,held toproduce women’s common subjugated experience.Although the claim of universal patriarchy no longer enjoys thekind of credibility it once did,the notion of a generally shared concep-tion of “women,”the corollary to that framework,has been much moredifficult to displace.Certainly,there have been plenty of debates:Isthere some commonality among “women”that preexists their oppres-sion,or do “women”have a bond by virtue of their oppression alone? Isthere a specificity to women’s cultures that is independent of their sub-ordination by hegemonic,masculinist cultures? Are the specificity andintegrity of women’s cultural or linguistic practices always specifiedagainst and,hence,within the terms of some more dominant culturalformation? If there is a region of the “specifically feminine,”one that isboth differentiated from the masculine as such and recognizable in itsdifference by an unmarked and,hence,presumed universality of“women”? The masculine/feminine binary constitutes not only theexclusive framework in which that specificity can be recognized,but in every other way the “specificity”of the feminine is once again fullydecontextualized and separated off analytically and politically from the constitution of class,race,ethnicity,and other axes of power rela-tions that both constitute “identity”and make the singular notion ofidentity a misnomer.4My suggestion is that the presumed universality and unity of thesubject of feminism is effectively undermined by the constraints of therepresentational discourse in which it functions.Indeed,the prematureinsistence on a stable subject of feminism,understood as a seamless cat-egory of women,inevitably generates multiple refusals to accept thecategory.These domains of exclusion reveal the coercive and regulatoryconsequences of that construction,even when the construction hasbeen elaborated for emancipatory purposes.Indeed,the fragmentationwithin feminism and the paradoxical opposition to feminism from“women”whom feminism claims to represent suggest the necessary

limits of identity politics.The suggestion that feminism can seek widerrepresentation for a subject that it itself constructs has the ironic conse-quence that feminist goals risk failure by refusing to take account of theconstitutive powers of their own representational claims.This problemis not ameliorated through an appeal to the category of women formerely “strategic”purposes,for strategies always have meanings thatexceed the purposes for which they are intended.In this case,exclusionitself might qualify as such an unintended yet consequential meaning.Byconforming to a requirement of representational politics that feminismarticulate a stable subject,feminism thus opens itself to charges of grossmisrepresentation.Obviously,the political task is not to refuse representational poli-tics—as if we could.The juridical structures of language and politicsconstitute the contemporary field of power;hence,there is no positionoutside this field,but only a critical genealogy of its own legitimatingpractices.As such,the critical point of departure is the historical present,as Marx put it.And the task is to formulate within this constitutedframe a critique of the categories of identity that contemporary juridi-cal structures engender,naturalize,and immobilize.Perhaps there is an opportunity at this juncture of cultural politics,a period that some would call “postfeminist,”to reflect from within afeminist perspective on the injunction to construct a subject of femi-nism.Within feminist political practice,a radical rethinking of theontological constructions of identity appears to be necessary in orderto formulate a representational politics that might revive feminism onother grounds.On the other hand,it may be time to entertain a radicalcritique that seeks to free feminist theory from the necessity of havingto construct a single or abiding ground which is invariably contestedby those identity positions or anti-identity positions that it invariablyexcludes.Do the exclusionary practices that ground feminist theory ina notion of “women”as subject paradoxically undercut feminist goalsto extend its claims to “representation”?5Perhaps the problem is even more serious.Is the construction of

Gender Trouble

8




the category of women as a coherent and stable subject an unwittingregulation and reification of gender relations? And is not such a reifica-tion precisely contrary to feminist aims? To what extent does the cate-gory of women achieve stability and coherence only in the context ofthe heterosexual matrix?6If a stable notion of gender no longer provesto be the foundational premise of feminist politics,perhaps a new sortof feminist politics is now desirable to contest the very reifications ofgender and identity,one that will take the variable construction ofidentity as both a methodological and normative prerequisite,if not apolitical goal.To trace the political operations that produce and conceal whatqualifies as the juridical subject of feminism is precisely the task of afeminist genealogy of the category of women.In the course of this effortto question “women”as the subject of feminism,the unproblematicinvocation of that category may prove to preclude the possibility of femi-nism as a representational politics.What sense does it make to extendrepresentation to subjects who are constructed through the exclusionof those who fail to conform to unspoken normative requirements ofthe subject? What relations of domination and exclusion are inadver-tently sustained when representation becomes the sole focus of politics?The identity of the feminist subject ought not to be the foundation offeminist politics,if the formation of the subject takes place within afield of power regularly buried through the assertion of that foundation.Perhaps,paradoxically,“representation”will be shown to make sensefor feminism only when the subject of “women”is nowhere presumed.ii.The Compulsory Order of Sex/Gender/DesireAlthough the unproblematic unity of “women”is often invoked to con-struct a solidarity of identity,a split is introduced in the feminist subjectby the distinction between sex and gender.Originally intended to dis-pute the biology-is-destiny formulation,the distinction between sexand gender serves the argument that whatever biological intractabilitysex appears to have,gender is culturally constructed:hence,gender is

neither the causal result of sex nor as seemingly fixed as sex.The unityof the subject is thus already potentially contested by the distinctionthat permits of gender as a multiple interpretation of sex.7If gender is the cultural meanings that the sexed body assumes,then a gender cannot be said to follow from a sex in any one way.Takento its logical limit,the sex/gender distinction suggests a radical dis-continuity between sexed bodies and culturally constructed genders.Assuming for the moment the stability of binary sex,it does not followthat the construction of “men”will accrue exclusively to the bodies ofmales or that “women”will interpret only female bodies.Further,evenif the sexes appear to be unproblematically binary in their morphologyand constitution (which will become a question),there is no reason toassume that genders ought also to remain as two.8 The presumption ofa binary gender system implicitly retains the belief in a mimetic rela-tion of gender to sex whereby gender mirrors sex or is otherwiserestricted by it.When the constructed status of gender is theorized asradically independent of sex,gender itself becomes a free-floating arti-fice,with the consequence that man and masculine might just as easilysignify a female body as a male one,and woman and feminine a malebody as easily as a female one.This radical splitting of the gendered subject poses yet another setof problems.Can we refer to a “given”sex or a “given”gender withoutfirst inquiring into how sex and/or gender is given,through whatmeans? And what is “sex”anyway? Is it natural,anatomical,chromoso-mal,or hormonal,and how is a feminist critic to assess the scientificdiscourses which purport to establish such “facts”for us?9 Does sexhave a history?10 Does each sex have a different history,or histories? Isthere a history of how the duality of sex was established,a genealogythat might expose the binary options as a variable construction? Arethe ostensibly natural facts of sex discursively produced by various sci-entific discourses in the service of other political and social interests?If the immutable character of sex is contested,perhaps this constructcalled “sex”is as culturally constructed as gender;indeed,perhaps it

was always already gender,with the consequence that the distinctionbetween sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all.11It would make no sense,then,to define gender as the culturalinterpretation of sex,if sex itself is a gendered category.Gender oughtnot to be conceived merely as the cultural inscription of meaning on apregiven sex (a juridical conception);gender must also designate thevery apparatus of production whereby the sexes themselves are estab-lished.As a result,gender is not to culture as sex is to nature;gender isalso the discursive/cultural means by which “sexed nature”or “a natur-al sex”is produced and established as “prediscursive,”prior to culture,a politically neutral surface on which culture acts.This construction of“sex”as the radically unconstructed will concern us again in the discus-sion of Lévi-Strauss and structuralism in chapter 2.At this juncture itis already clear that one way the internal stability and binary frame forsex is effectively secured is by casting the duality of sex in a prediscur-sive domain.This production of sex as the prediscursive ought to beunderstood as the effect of the apparatus of cultural construction des-ignated by gender.How,then,does gender need to be reformulated toencompass the power relations that produce the effect of a prediscur-sive sex and so conceal that very operation of discursive production?iii.Gender:The Circular Ruins of Contemporary DebateIs there “a”gender which persons are said to have,or is it an essentialattribute that a person is said to be,as implied in the question “Whatgender are you?”When feminist theorists claim that gender is the cul-tural interpretation of sex or that gender is culturally constructed,whatis the manner or mechanism of this construction? If gender is construct-ed,could it be constructed differently,or does its constructednessimply some form of social determinism,foreclosing the possibility ofagency and transformation? Does “construction”suggest that certainlaws generate gender differences along universal axes of sexual differ-ence? How and where does the construction of gender take place?What

sense can we make of a construction that cannot assume a human con-structor prior to that construction? On some accounts,the notion thatgender is constructed suggests a certain determinism of gender mean-ings inscribed on anatomically differentiated bodies,where those bod-ies are understood as passive recipients of an inexorable cultural law.When the relevant “culture”that “constructs”gender is understood interms of such a law or set of laws,then it seems that gender is as deter-mined and fixed as it was under the biology-is-destiny formulation.Insuch a case,not biology,but culture,becomes destiny.On the other hand,Simone de Beauvoir suggests in The Second Sexthat “one is not born a woman,but,rather,becomes one.”12ForBeauvoir,gender is “constructed,”but implied in her formulation is anagent,a cogito,who somehow takes on or appropriates that gender andcould,in principle,take on some other gender.Is gender as variableand volitional as Beauvoir’s account seems to suggest? Can “construc-tion”in such a case be reduced to a form of choice? Beauvoir is clearthat one “becomes”a woman,but always under a cultural compulsionto become one.And clearly,the compulsion does not come from “sex.”There is nothing in her account that guarantees that the “one”whobecomes a woman is necessarily female.If “the body is a situation,”13asshe claims,there is no recourse to a body that has not always alreadybeen interpreted by cultural meanings;hence,sex could not qualify asa prediscursive anatomical facticity.Indeed,sex,by definition,will beshown to have been gender all along.14The controversy over the meaning of constructionappears tofounder on the conventional philosophical polarity between free willand determinism.As a consequence,one might reasonably suspect thatsome common linguistic restriction on thought both forms and limitsthe terms of the debate.Within those terms,“the body”appears as apassive medium on which cultural meanings are inscribed or as theinstrument through which an appropriative and interpretive willdetermines a cultural meaning for itself.In either case,the body is fig-ured as a mere instrumentor mediumfor which a set of cultural mean-

ings are only externally related.But “the body”is itself a construction,as are the myriad “bodies”that constitute the domain of gendered sub-jects.Bodies cannot be said to have a signifiable existence prior to themark of their gender;the question then emerges:To what extent doesthe body come into beingin and through the mark(s) of gender? How dowe reconceive the body no longer as a passive medium or instrumentawaiting the enlivening capacity of a distinctly immaterial will?15Whether gender or sex is fixed or free is a function of a discoursewhich,it will be suggested,seeks to set certain limits to analysis or tosafeguard certain tenets of humanism as presuppositional to any analy-sis of gender.The locus of intractability,whether in “sex”or “gender”or in the very meaning of “construction,”provides a clue to what cul-tural possibilities can and cannot become mobilized through any fur-ther analysis.The limits of the discursive analysis of gender presupposeand preempt the possibilities of imaginable and realizable gender con-figurations within culture.This is not to say that any and all genderedpossibilities are open,but that the boundaries of analysis suggest thelimits of a discursively conditioned experience.These limits are alwaysset within the terms of a hegemonic cultural discourse predicated onbinary structures that appear as the language of universal rationality.Constraint is thus built into what that language constitutes as the imag-inable domain of gender.Although social scientists refer to gender as a “factor”or a “dimension”of an analysis,it is also applied to embodied persons as “a mark”of bio-logical,linguistic,and/or cultural difference.In these latter cases,gender can be understood as a signification that an (already) sexuallydifferentiated body assumes,but even then that signification existsonly in relation to another,opposing signification.Some feminist theo-rists claim that gender is “a relation,”indeed,a set of relations,and notan individual attribute.Others,following Beauvoir,would argue thatonly the feminine gender is marked,that the universal person and themasculine gender are conflated,thereby defining women in terms of

their sex and extolling men as the bearers of a body-transcendent uni-versal personhood.In a move that complicates the discussion further,Luce Irigarayargues that women constitute a paradox,if not a contradiction,withinthe discourse of identity itself.Women are the “sex”which is not “one.”Within a language pervasively masculinist,a phallogocentric language,women constitute the unrepresentable.In other words,women repre-sent the sex that cannot be thought,a linguistic absence and opacity.Within a language that rests on univocal signification,the female sexconstitutes the unconstrainable and undesignatable.In this sense,women are the sex which is not “one,”but multiple.16In opposition toBeauvoir,for whom women are designated as the Other,Irigarayargues that both the subject and the Other are masculine mainstays of aclosed phallogocentric signifying economy that achieves its totalizinggoal through the exclusion of the feminine altogether.For Beauvoir,women are the negative of men,the lack against which masculine iden-tity differentiates itself;for Irigaray,that particular dialectic consti-tutes a system that excludes an entirely different economy ofsignification.Women are not only represented falsely within theSartrian frame of signifying-subject and signified-Other,but the falsityof the signification points out the entire structure of representation asinadequate.The sex which is not one,then,provides a point of depar-ture for a criticism of hegemonic Western representation and of themetaphysics of substance that structures the very notion of the subject.What is the metaphysics of substance,and how does it informthinking about the categories of sex? In the first instance,humanistconceptions of the subject tend to assume a substantive person who isthe bearer of various essential and nonessential attributes.A humanistfeminist position might understand gender as an attributeof a personwho is characterized essentially as a pregendered substance or “core,”called the person,denoting a universal capacity for reason,moraldeliberation,or language.The universal conception of the person,however,is displaced as a point of departure for a social theory of gen-

der by those historical and anthropological positions that understandgender as a relation among socially constituted subjects in specifiablecontexts.This relational or contextual point of view suggests that whatthe person “is,”and,indeed,what gender “is,”is always relative to theconstructed relations in which it is determined.17As a shifting andcontextual phenomenon,gender does not denote a substantive being,but a relative point of convergence among culturally and historicallyspecific sets of relations.Irigaray would maintain,however,that the feminine “sex”is a pointof linguistic absence,the impossibility of a grammatically denoted sub-stance,and,hence,the point of view that exposes that substance as anabiding and foundational illusion of a masculinist discourse.Thisabsence is not marked as such within the masculine signifying econo-my—a contention that reverses Beauvoir’s argument (and Wittig’s)that the female sex is marked,while the male sex is not.For Irigaray,the female sex is not a “lack”or an “Other”that immanently and nega-tively defines the subject in its masculinity.On the contrary,the femalesex eludes the very requirements of representation,for she is neither“Other”nor the “lack,”those categories remaining relative to theSartrian subject,immanent to that phallogocentric scheme.Hence,forIrigaray,the feminine could never be the mark of a subject,as Beauvoirwould suggest.Further,the feminine could not be theorized in termsof a determinate relationbetween the masculine and the feminine with-in any given discourse,for discourse is not a relevant notion here.Evenin their variety,discourses constitute so many modalities of phallogo-centric language.The female sex is thus also the subject that is not one.The relation between masculine and feminine cannot be represented ina signifying economy in which the masculine constitutes the closed cir-cle of signifier and signified.Paradoxically enough,Beauvoir prefig-ured this impossibility in The Second Sex when she argued that mencould not settle the question of women because they would then beacting as both judge and party to the case.18The distinctions among the above positions are far from discrete;

each of them can be understood to problematize the locality andmeaning of both the “subject”and “gender”within the context ofsocially instituted gender asymmetry.The interpretive possibilities ofgender are in no sense exhausted by the alternatives suggested above.The problematic circularity of a feminist inquiry into gender is under-scored by the presence of positions which,on the one hand,presumethat gender is a secondary characteristic of persons and those which,on the other hand,argue that the very notion of the person,positionedwithin language as a “subject,”is a masculinist construction and prerog-ative which effectively excludes the structural and semantic possibilityof a feminine gender.The consequence of such sharp disagreementsabout the meaning of gender (indeed,whether genderis the term to beargued about at all,or whether the discursive construction of sexis,indeed,more fundamental,or perhaps womenor womanand/or menandman) establishes the need for a radical rethinking of the categories ofidentity within the context of relations of radical gender asymmetry.For Beauvoir,the “subject”within the existential analytic of misog-yny is always already masculine,conflated with the universal,differen-tiating itself from a feminine “Other”outside the universalizing normsof personhood,hopelessly “particular,”embodied,condemned toimmanence.Although Beauvoir is often understood to be calling forthe right of women,in effect,to become existential subjects and,hence,for inclusion within the terms of an abstract universality,herposition also implies a fundamental critique of the very disembodi-ment of the abstract masculine epistemological subject.19That subjectis abstract to the extent that it disavows its socially marked embodi-ment and,further,projects that disavowed and disparaged embodi-ment on to the feminine sphere,effectively renaming the body asfemale.This association of the body with the female works along magi-cal relations of reciprocity whereby the female sex becomes restrictedto its body,and the male body,fully disavowed,becomes,paradoxical-ly,the incorporeal instrument of an ostensibly radical freedom.Beauvoir’s analysis implicitly poses the question:Through what act of

Gender Trouble

16




negation and disavowal does the masculine pose as a disembodied uni-versality and the feminine get constructed as a disavowed corporeality?The dialectic of master-slave,here fully reformulated within the non-reciprocal terms of gender asymmetry,prefigures what Irigaray willlater describe as the masculine signifying economy that includes boththe existential subject and its Other.Beauvoir proposes that the female body ought to be the situationand instrumentality of women’s freedom,not a defining and limitingessence.20The theory of embodiment informing Beauvoir’s analysis isclearly limited by the uncritical reproduction of the Cartesian distinc-tion between freedom and the body.Despite my own previous effortsto argue the contrary,it appears that Beauvoir maintains the mind/body dualism,even as she proposes a synthesis of those terms.21Thepreservation of that very distinction can be read as symptomatic of thevery phallogocentrism that Beauvoir underestimates.In the philosoph-ical tradition that begins with Plato and continues through Descartes,Husserl,and Sartre,the ontological distinction between soul (con-sciousness,mind) and body invariably supports relations of politicaland psychic subordination and hierarchy.The mind not only subjugatesthe body,but occasionally entertains the fantasy of fleeing its embodi-ment altogether.The cultural associations of mind with masculinityand body with femininity are well documented within the field of phi-losophy and feminism.22As a result,any uncritical reproduction of themind/body distinction ought to be rethought for the implicit genderhierarchy that the distinction has conventionally produced,main-tained,and rationalized.The discursive construction of “the body”and its separation from“freedom”in Beauvoir fails to mark along the axis of gender the verymind-body distinction that is supposed to illuminate the persistence ofgender asymmetry.Officially,Beauvoir contends that the female bodyis marked within masculinist discourse,whereby the masculine body,in its conflation with the universal,remains unmarked.Irigaray clear-ly suggests that both marker and marked are maintained within a

masculinist mode of signification in which the female body is “markedoff,”as it were,from the domain of the signifiable.In post-Hegelianterms,she is “cancelled,”but not preserved.On Irigaray’s reading,Beauvoir’s claim that woman “is sex”is reversed to mean that she is notthe sex she is designated to be,but,rather,the masculine sex encore(anden corps) parading in the mode of otherness.For Irigaray,that phallogo-centric mode of signifying the female sex perpetually reproduces phan-tasms of its own self-amplifying desire.Instead of a self-limitinglinguistic gesture that grants alterity or difference to women,phallogo-centrism offers a name to eclipse the feminine and take its place.iv.Theorizing the Binary,the Unitary,and BeyondBeauvoir and Irigaray clearly differ over the fundamental structures bywhich gender asymmetry is reproduced;Beauvoir turns to the failedreciprocity of an asymmetrical dialectic,while Irigaray suggests thatthe dialectic itself is the monologic elaboration of a masculinist signify-ing economy.Although Irigaray clearly broadens the scope of feministcritique by exposing the epistemological,ontological,and logicalstructures of a masculinist signifying economy,the power of her analy-sis is undercut precisely by its globalizing reach.Is it possible to identi-fy a monolithic as well as a monologic masculinist economy thattraverses the array of cultural and historical contexts in which sexualdifference takes place? Is the failure to acknowledge the specific cul-tural operations of gender oppression itself a kind of epistemologicalimperialism,one which is not ameliorated by the simple elaboration ofcultural differences as “examples”of the selfsame phallogocentrism?The effort to include“Other”cultures as variegated amplifications of aglobal phallogocentrism constitutes an appropriative act that risks arepetition of the self-aggrandizing gesture of phallogocentrism,colo-nizing under the sign of the same those differences that might other-wise call that totalizing concept into question.23Feminist critique ought to explore the totalizing claims of a mas-culinist signifying economy,but also remain self-critical with respect to

the totalizing gestures of feminism.The effort to identify the enemy assingular in form is a reverse-discourse that uncritically mimics thestrategy of the oppressor instead of offering a different set of terms.That the tactic can operate in feminist and antifeminist contexts alikesuggests that the colonizing gesture is not primarily or irreducibly mas-culinist.It can operate to effect other relations of racial,class,and het-erosexist subordination,to name but a few.And clearly,listing thevarieties of oppression,as I began to do,assumes their discrete,sequen-tial coexistence along a horizontal axis that does not describe their con-vergences within the social field.A vertical model is similarlyinsufficient;oppressions cannot be summarily ranked,causally related,distributed among planes of “originality”and “derivativeness.”24Indeed,the field of power structured in part by the imperializing gesture ofdialectical appropriation exceeds and encompasses the axis of sexualdifference,offering a mapping of intersecting differentials which cannotbe summarily hierarchized either within the terms of phallogocentrismor any other candidate for the position of “primary condition of oppres-sion.”Rather than an exclusive tactic of masculinist signifying econo-mies,dialectical appropriation and suppression of the Other is onetactic among many,deployed centrally but not exclusively in the serviceof expanding and rationalizing the masculinist domain.The contemporary feminist debates over essentialism raise thequestion of the universality of female identity and masculinist oppres-sion in other ways.Universalistic claims are based on a common orshared epistemological standpoint,understood as the articulated con-sciousness or shared structures of oppression or in the ostensibly tran-scultural structures of femininity,maternity,sexuality,and/or écriturefeminine.The opening discussion in this chapter argued that this global-izing gesture has spawned a number of criticisms from women whoclaim that the category of “women”is normative and exclusionary andis invoked with the unmarked dimensions of class and racial privilegeintact.In other words,the insistence upon the coherence and unity ofthe category of women has effectively refused the multiplicity of

cultural,social,and political intersections in which the concrete arrayof “women”are constructed.Some efforts have been made to formulate coalitional politicswhich do not assume in advance what the content of “women”will be.They propose instead a set of dialogic encounters by which variouslypositioned women articulate separate identities within the frameworkof an emergent coalition.Clearly,the value of coalitional politics is notto be underestimated,but the very form of coalition,of an emergingand unpredictable assemblage of positions,cannot be figured inadvance.Despite the clearly democratizing impulse that motivatescoalition building,the coalitional theorist can inadvertently reinsertherself as sovereign of the process by trying to assert an ideal form forcoalitional structures in advance,one that will effectively guaranteeunity as the outcome.Related efforts to determine what is and is notthe true shape of a dialogue,what constitutes a subject-position,and,most importantly,when “unity”has been reached,can impede the self-shaping and self-limiting dynamics of coalition.The insistence in advance on coalitional “unity”as a goal assumesthat solidarity,whatever its price,is a prerequisite for political action.But what sort of politics demands that kind of advance purchase onunity? Perhaps a coalition needs to acknowledge its contradictions andtake action with those contradictions intact.Perhaps also part of whatdialogic understanding entails is the acceptance of divergence,break-age,splinter,and fragmentation as part of the often tortuous process ofdemocratization.The very notion of “dialogue”is culturally specificand historically bound,and while one speaker may feel secure that aconversation is happening,another may be sure it is not.The powerrelations that condition and limit dialogic possibilities need first to beinterrogated.Otherwise,the model of dialogue risks relapsing into aliberal model that assumes that speaking agents occupy equal positionsof power and speak with the same presuppositions about what consti-tutes “agreement”and “unity”and,indeed,that those are the goals tobe sought.It would be wrong to assume in advance that there is a cate-

gory of “women”that simply needs to be filled in with various compo-nents of race,class,age,ethnicity,and sexuality in order to becomecomplete.The assumption of its essential incompleteness permits thatcategory to serve as a permanently available site of contested mean-ings.The definitional incompleteness of the category might then serveas a normative ideal relieved of coercive force.Is “unity”necessary for effective political action? Is the prematureinsistence on the goal of unity precisely the cause of an ever more bit-ter fragmentation among the ranks? Certain forms of acknowledgedfragmentation might facilitate coalitional action precisely because the “unity”of the category of women is neither presupposed nor desired.Does “unity”set up an exclusionary norm of solidarity at the level ofidentity that rules out the possibility of a set of actions which disruptthe very borders of identity concepts,or which seek to accomplishprecisely that disruption as an explicit political aim? Without the pre-supposition or goal of “unity,”which is,in either case,always institutedat a conceptual level,provisional unities might emerge in the contextof concrete actions that have purposes other than the articulation ofidentity.Without the compulsory expectation that feminist actionsmust be instituted from some stable,unified,and agreed-upon identi-ty,those actions might well get a quicker start and seem more conge-nial to a number of “women”for whom the meaning of the category ispermanently moot.This antifoundationalist approach to coalitional politics assumesneither that “identity”is a premise nor that the shape or meaning of acoalitional assemblage can be known prior to its achievement.Becausethe articulation of an identity within available cultural terms instates adefinition that forecloses in advance the emergence of new identityconcepts in and through politically engaged actions,the foundationalisttactic cannot take the transformation or expansion of existing identityconcepts as a normative goal.Moreover,when agreed-upon identitiesor agreed-upon dialogic structures,through which already estab-lished identities are communicated,no longer constitute the theme or

subject of politics,then identities can come into being and dissolvedepending on the concrete practices that constitute them.Certainpolitical practices institute identities on a contingent basis in order toaccomplish whatever aims are in view.Coalitional politics requires nei-ther an expanded category of “women”nor an internally multiplicitousself that offers its complexity at once.Gender is a complexity whose totality is permanently deferred,never fully what it is at any given juncture in time.An open coalition,then,will affirm identities that are alternately instituted and relin-quished according to the purposes at hand;it will be an open assem-blage that permits of multiple convergences and divergences withoutobedience to a normative telos of definitional closure.v.Identity,Sex,and the Metaphysics of SubstanceWhat can be meant by “identity,”then,and what grounds the presump-tion that identities are self-identical,persisting through time as thesame,unified and internally coherent? More importantly,how dothese assumptions inform the discourses on “gender identity”? It wouldbe wrong to think that the discussion of “identity”ought to proceedprior to a discussion of gender identity for the simple reason that “per-sons”only become intelligible through becoming gendered in confor-mity with recognizable standards of gender intelligibility.Sociologicaldiscussions have conventionally sought to understand the notion of theperson in terms of an agency that claims ontological priority to thevarious roles and functions through which it assumes social visibilityand meaning.Within philosophical discourse itself,the notion of “theperson”has received analytic elaboration on the assumption that what-ever social context the person is “in”remains somehow externallyrelated to the definitional structure of personhood,be that conscious-ness,the capacity for language,or moral deliberation.Although thatliterature is not examined here,one premise of such inquiries is thefocus of critical exploration and inversion.Whereas the question ofwhat constitutes “personal identity”within philosophical accounts

Gender Trouble

22




almost always centers on the question of what internal feature of theperson establishes the continuity or self-identity of the person throughtime,the question here will be:To what extent do regulatory practices ofgender formation and division constitute identity,the internal coher-ence of the subject,indeed,the self-identical status of the person? Towhat extent is “identity”a normative ideal rather than a descriptivefeature of experience? And how do the regulatory practices that gov-ern gender also govern culturally intelligible notions of identity? Inother words,the “coherence”and “continuity”of “the person”are notlogical or analytic features of personhood,but,rather,socially institut-ed and maintained norms of intelligibility.Inasmuch as “identity”isassured through the stabilizing concepts of sex,gender,and sexuality,the very notion of “the person”is called into question by the culturalemergence of those “incoherent”or “discontinuous”gendered beingswho appear to be persons but who fail to conform to the genderednorms of cultural intelligibility by which persons are defined.“Intelligible”genders are those which in some sense institute andmaintain relations of coherence and continuity among sex,gender,sexual practice,and desire.In other words,the spectres of discontinu-ity and incoherence,themselves thinkable only in relation to existingnorms of continuity and coherence,are constantly prohibited and pro-duced by the very laws that seek to establish causal or expressive linesof connection among biological sex,culturally constituted genders,and the “expression”or “effect”of both in the manifestation of sexualdesire through sexual practice.The notion that there might be a “truth”of sex,as Foucault ironical-ly terms it,is produced precisely through the regulatory practices thatgenerate coherent identities through the matrix of coherent gendernorms.The heterosexualization of desire requires and institutes theproduction of discrete and asymmetrical oppositions between“feminine”and “masculine,”where these are understood as expressiveattributes of “male”and “female.”The cultural matrix through whichgender identity has become intelligible requires that certain kinds of

Subjects of Sex/Gender/Desire

“identities”cannot “exist”—that is,those in which gender does not fol-low from sex and those in which the practices of desire do not “follow”from either sex or gender.“Follow”in this context is a political relationof entailment instituted by the cultural laws that establish and regulatethe shape and meaning of sexuality.Indeed,precisely because certainkinds of “gender identities”fail to conform to those norms of culturalintelligibility,they appear only as developmental failures or logicalimpossibilities from within that domain.Their persistence and prolifer-ation,however,provide critical opportunities to expose the limits andregulatory aims of that domain of intelligibility and,hence,to open upwithin the very terms of that matrix of intelligibility rival and subver-sive matrices of gender disorder.Before such disordering practices are considered,however,it seemscrucial to understand the “matrix of intelligibility.”Is it singular? Ofwhat is it composed? What is the peculiar alliance presumed to existbetween a system of compulsory heterosexuality and the discursive cat-egories that establish the identity concepts of sex? If “identity”is an effectof discursive practices,to what extent is gender identity,construed as arelationship among sex,gender,sexual practice,and desire,the effect ofa regulatory practice that can be identified as compulsory heterosexual-ity? Would that explanation return us to yet another totalizing frame inwhich compulsory heterosexuality merely takes the place of phallogo-centrism as the monolithic cause of gender oppression?Within the spectrum of French feminist and poststructuralist the-ory,very different regimes of power are understood to produce theidentity concepts of sex.Consider the divergence between those posi-tions,such as Irigaray’s,that claim there is only one sex,the masculine,that elaborates itself in and through the production of the “Other,”andthose positions,Foucault’s,for instance,that assume that the categoryof sex,whether masculine or feminine,is a production of a diffuse reg-ulatory economy of sexuality.Consider also Wittig’s argument that thecategory of sex is,under the conditions of compulsory heterosexuality,always feminine (the masculine remaining unmarked and,hence,syn-

onymous with the “universal”).Wittig concurs,however paradoxically,with Foucault in claiming that the category of sex would itself disap-pear and,indeed,dissipatethrough the disruption and displacement ofheterosexual hegemony.The various explanatory models offered here suggest the very dif-ferent ways in which the category of sex is understood depending onhow the field of power is articulated.Is it possible to maintain the com-plexity of these fields of power and think through their productivecapacities together? On the one hand,Irigaray’s theory of sexual differ-ence suggests that women can never be understood on the model of a“subject”within the conventional representational systems of Westernculture precisely because they constitute the fetish of representationand,hence,the unrepresentable as such.Women can never “be,”accord-ing to this ontology of substances,precisely because they are the rela-tion of difference,the excluded,by which that domain marks itself off.Women are also a “difference”that cannot be understood as the simplenegation or “Other”of the always-already-masculine subject.As dis-cussed earlier,they are neither the subject nor its Other,but a differ-ence from the economy of binary opposition,itself a ruse for amonologic elaboration of the masculine.Central to each of these views,however,is the notion that sexappears within hegemonic language as a substance,as,metaphysicallyspeaking,a self-identical being.This appearance is achieved through aperformative twist of language and/or discourse that conceals the factthat “being”a sex or a gender is fundamentally impossible.For Irigaray,grammar can never be a true index of gender relations preciselybecause it supports the substantial model of gender as a binary relationbetween two positive and representable terms.25In Irigaray’s view,thesubstantive grammar of gender,which assumes men and women as wellas their attributes of masculine and feminine,is an example of a binarythat effectively masks the univocal and hegemonic discourse of the mas-culine,phallogocentrism,silencing the feminine as a site of subversivemultiplicity.For Foucault,the substantive grammar of sex imposes an

artificial binary relation between the sexes,as well as an artificial inter-nal coherence within each term of that binary.The binary regulation ofsexuality suppresses the subversive multiplicity of a sexuality that dis-rupts heterosexual,reproductive,and medicojuridical hegemonies.For Wittig,the binary restriction on sex serves the reproductiveaims of a system of compulsory heterosexuality;occasionally,sheclaims that the overthrow of compulsory heterosexuality will inaugu-rate a true humanism of “the person”freed from the shackles of sex.Inother contexts,she suggests that the profusion and diffusion of a non-phallocentric erotic economy will dispel the illusions of sex,gender,and identity.At yet other textual moments it seems that “the lesbian”emerges as a third gender that promises to transcend the binaryrestriction on sex imposed by the system of compulsory heterosexual-ity.In her defense of the “cognitive subject,”Wittig appears to have nometaphysical quarrel with hegemonic modes of signification or repre-sentation;indeed,the subject,with its attribute of self-determination,appears to be the rehabilitation of the agent of existential choice underthe name of the lesbian:“the advent of individual subjects demandsfirst destroying the categories of sex ...the lesbian is the only conceptI know of which is beyond the categories of sex.”26She does not criti-cize “the subject”as invariably masculine according to the rules of aninevitably patriarchal Symbolic,but proposes in its place the equiva-lent of a lesbian subject as language-user.27The identification of women with “sex,”for Beauvoir as for Wittig,is a conflation of the category of women with the ostensibly sexualizedfeatures of their bodies and,hence,a refusal to grant freedom andautonomy to women as it is purportedly enjoyed by men.Thus,thedestruction of the category of sex would be the destruction of anattribute,sex,that has,through a misogynist gesture of synecdoche,come to take the place of the person,the self-determining cogito.Inother words,only men are “persons,”and there is no gender but the feminine:

Gender is the linguistic index of the political opposition between the sexes.Gender is used here in the singular because indeed thereare not two genders.There is only one:the feminine,the “masculine”not being a gender.For the masculine is not the masculine,but thegeneral.28Hence,Wittig calls for the destruction of “sex”so that women canassume the status of a universal subject.On the way toward thatdestruction,“women”must assume both a particular and a universalpoint of view.29As a subject who can realize concrete universalitythrough freedom,Wittig’s lesbian confirms rather than contests thenormative promise of humanist ideals premised on the metaphysics ofsubstance.In this respect,Wittig is distinguished from Irigaray,notonly in terms of the now familiar oppositions between essentialism andmaterialism,30but in terms of the adherence to a metaphysics of sub-stance that confirms the normative model of humanism as the frame-work for feminism.Where it seems that Wittig has subscribed to aradical project of lesbian emancipation and enforced a distinctionbetween “lesbian”and “woman,”she does this through the defense ofthe pregendered “person,”characterized as freedom.This move notonly confirms the presocial status of human freedom,but subscribes tothat metaphysics of substance that is responsible for the productionand naturalization of the category of sex itself.The metaphysics of substance is a phrase that is associated withNietzsche within the contemporary criticism of philosophical dis-course.In a commentary on Nietzsche,Michel Haar argues that anumber of philosophical ontologies have been trapped within certainillusions of “Being”and “Substance”that are fostered by the belief thatthe grammatical formulation of subject and predicate reflects the priorontological reality of substance and attribute.These constructs,arguesHaar,constitute the artificial philosophical means by which simplicity,order,and identity are effectively instituted.In no sense,however,do

they reveal or represent some true order of things.For our purposes,this Nietzschean criticism becomes instructive when it is applied to thepsychological categories that govern much popular and theoreticalthinking about gender identity.According to Haar,the critique of themetaphysics of substance implies a critique of the very notion of thepsychological person as a substantive thing:The destruction of logic by means of its genealogy brings with it aswell the ruin of the psychological categories founded upon this logic.All psychological categories (the ego,the individual,the person)derive from the illusion of substantial identity.But this illusion goesback basically to a superstition that deceives not only common sensebut also philosophers—namely,the belief in language and,more pre-cisely,in the truth of grammatical categories.It was grammar (thestructure of subject and predicate) that inspired Descartes’certaintythat “I”is the subject of “think,”whereas it is rather the thoughts thatcome to “me”:at bottom,faith in grammar simply conveys the will tobe the “cause”of one’s thoughts.The subject,the self,the individual,are just so many false concepts,since they transform into substancesfictitious unities having at the start only a linguistic reality.31Wittig provides an alternative critique by showing that personscannot be signified within language without the mark of gender.Sheprovides a political analysis of the grammar of gender in French.According to Wittig,gender not only designates persons,“qualifies”them,as it were,but constitutes a conceptual episteme by which binarygender is universalized.Although French gives gender to all sorts ofnouns other than persons,Wittig argues that her analysis has conse-quences for English as well.At the outset of “The Mark of Gender”(1984),she writes:The mark of gender,according to grammarians,concerns substan-tives.They talk about it in terms of function.If they question itsmeaning,they may joke about it,calling gender a “fictive sex.”...as

far as the categories of the person are concerned,both [English andFrench] are bearers of gender to the same extent.Both indeed giveway to a primitive ontological concept that enforces in language adivision of beings into sexes....As an ontological concept that dealswith the nature of Being,along with a whole nebula of other primi-tive concepts belonging to the same line of thought,gender seems tobelong primarily to philosophy.32For gender to “belong to philosophy”is,for Wittig,to belong to“that body of self-evident concepts without which philosophers believethey cannot develop a line of reasoning and which for them go withoutsaying,for they exist prior to any thought,any social order,innature.”33Wittig’s view is corroborated by that popular discourse ongender identity that uncritically employs the inflectional attribution of“being”to genders and to “sexualities.”The unproblematic claim to“be”a woman and “be”heterosexual would be symptomatic of thatmetaphysics of gender substances.In the case of both “men”and“women,”this claim tends to subordinate the notion of gender underthat of identity and to lead to the conclusion that a person isa genderand isone in virtue of his or her sex,psychic sense of self,and variousexpressions of that psychic self,the most salient being that of sexualdesire.In such a prefeminist context,gender,naively (rather than crit-ically) confused with sex,serves as a unifying principle of the embod-ied self and maintains that unity over and against an “opposite sex”whose structure is presumed to maintain a parallel but oppositionalinternal coherence among sex,gender,and desire.The articulation “Ifeel like a woman”by a female or “I feel like a man”by a male presup-poses that in neither case is the claim meaninglessly redundant.Although it might appear unproblematic to be a given anatomy(although we shall later consider the way in which that project is alsofraught with difficulty),the experience of a gendered psychic disposi-tion or cultural identity is considered an achievement.Thus,“I feel likea woman”is true to the extent that Aretha Franklin’s invocation of the

defining Other is assumed:“You make me feel like a natural woman.”34This achievement requires a differentiation from the opposite gender.Hence,one is one’s gender to the extent that one is not the other gen-der,a formulation that presupposes and enforces the restriction ofgender within that binary pair.Gender can denote a unityof experience,of sex,gender,anddesire,only when sex can be understood in some sense to necessitategender—where gender is a psychic and/or cultural designation of theself—and desire—where desire is heterosexual and therefore differ-entiates itself through an oppositional relation to that other gender itdesires.The internal coherence or unity of either gender,man orwoman,thereby requires both a stable and oppositional heterosexuali-ty.That institutional heterosexuality both requires and produces theunivocity of each of the gendered terms that constitute the limit ofgendered possibilities within an oppositional,binary gender system.This conception of gender presupposes not only a causal relationamong sex,gender,and desire,but suggests as well that desire reflectsor expresses gender and that gender reflects or expresses desire.Themetaphysical unity of the three is assumed to be truly known andexpressed in a differentiating desire for an oppositional gender—thatis,in a form of oppositional heterosexuality.Whether as a naturalisticparadigm which establishes a causal continuity among sex,gender,anddesire,or as an authentic-expressive paradigm in which some true selfis said to be revealed simultaneously or successively in sex,gender,anddesire,here “the old dream of symmetry,”as Irigaray has called it,ispresupposed,reified,and rationalized.This rough sketch of gender gives us a clue to understanding the political reasons for the substantializing view of gender.The insti-tution of a compulsory and naturalized heterosexuality requires andregulates gender as a binary relation in which the masculine term isdifferentiated from a feminine term,and this differentiation is accom-plished through the practices of heterosexual desire.The act of differ-entiating the two oppositional moments of the binary results in a

consolidation of each term,the respective internal coherence of sex,gender,and desire.The strategic displacement of that binary relation and the meta-physics of substance on which it relies presuppose that the categoriesof female and male,woman and man,are similarly produced withinthe binary frame.Foucault implicitly subscribes to such an explana-tion.In the closing chapter of the first volume of The History of Sexualityand in his brief but significant introduction to Herculine Barbin,Being theRecently Discovered Journals of a Nineteenth-Century Hermaphrodite,35Foucault suggests that the category of sex,prior to any categorizationof sexual difference,is itself constructed through a historically specificmode of sexuality.The tactical production of the discrete and binarycategorization of sex conceals the strategic aims of that very apparatusof production by postulating “sex”as “a cause”of sexual experience,behavior,and desire.Foucault’s genealogical inquiry exposes thisostensible “cause”as “an effect,”the production of a given regime ofsexuality that seeks to regulate sexual experience by instating the dis-crete categories of sex as foundational and causal functions within anydiscursive account of sexuality.Foucault’s introduction to the journals of the hermaphrodite,Herculine Barbin,suggests that the genealogical critique of these rei-fied categories of sex is the inadvertent consequence of sexual prac-tices that cannot be accounted for within the medicolegal discourse ofa naturalized heterosexuality.Herculine is not an “identity,”but thesexual impossibility of an identity.Although male and female anatomi-cal elements are jointly distributed in and on this body,that is not thetrue source of scandal.The linguistic conventions that produce intelli-gible gendered selves find their limit in Herculine precisely becauseshe/he occasions a convergence and disorganization of the rules thatgovern sex/gender/desire.Herculine deploys and redistributes theterms of a binary system,but that very redistribution disrupts and pro-liferates those terms outside the binary itself.According to Foucault,Herculine is not categorizable within the gender binary as it stands;the

disconcerting convergence of heterosexuality and homosexuality inher/his person are only occasioned,but never caused,by his/heranatomical discontinuity.Foucault’s appropriation of Herculine is sus-pect,36but his analysis implies the interesting belief that sexual hetero-geneity (paradoxically foreclosed by a naturalized “hetero”-sexuality)implies a critique of the metaphysics of substance as it informs theidentitarian categories of sex.Foucault imagines Herculine’s experi-ence as “a world of pleasures in which grins hang about without thecat.”37Smiles,happinesses,pleasures,and desires are figured here asqualities without an abiding substance to which they are said to adhere.As free-floating attributes,they suggest the possibility of a genderedexperience that cannot be grasped through the substantializing andhierarchizing grammar of nouns (res extensa) and adjectives (attributes,essential and accidental).Through his cursory reading of Herculine,Foucault proposes an ontology of accidental attributes that exposes thepostulation of identity as a culturally restricted principle of order andhierarchy,a regulatory fiction.If it is possible to speak of a “man”with a masculine attribute andto understand that attribute as a happy but accidental feature of thatman,then it is also possible to speak of a “man”with a feminineattribute,whatever that is,but still to maintain the integrity of thegender.But once we dispense with the priority of “man”and “woman”as abiding substances,then it is no longer possible to subordinate dis-sonant gendered features as so many secondary and accidental charac-teristics of a gender ontology that is fundamentally intact.If the notionof an abiding substance is a fictive construction produced through thecompulsory ordering of attributes into coherent gender sequences,then it seems that gender as substance,the viability of manand womanas nouns,is called into question by the dissonant play of attributes thatfail to conform to sequential or causal models of intelligibility.The appearance of an abiding substance or gendered self,what thepsychiatrist Robert Stoller refers to as a “gender core,”38is thus pro-duced by the regulation of attributes along culturally established lines

of coherence.As a result,the exposure of this fictive production isconditioned by the deregulated play of attributes that resist assimi-lation into the ready made framework of primary nouns and subordi-nate adjectives.It is of course always possible to argue that dissonantadjectives work retroactively to redefine the substantive identities theyare said to modify and,hence,to expand the substantive categories ofgender to include possibilities that they previously excluded.But ifthese substances are nothing other than the coherences contingentlycreated through the regulation of attributes,it would seem that theontology of substances itself is not only an artificial effect,but essen-tially superfluous.In this sense,genderis not a noun,but neither is it a set of free-floating attributes,for we have seen that the substantive effect of gen-der is performatively produced and compelled by the regulatorypractices of gender coherence.Hence,within the inherited discourseof the metaphysics of substance,gender proves to be performative—that is,constituting the identity it is purported to be.In this sense,gender is always a doing,though not a doing by a subject who might besaid to preexist the deed.The challenge for rethinking gender cate-gories outside of the metaphysics of substance will have to consider therelevance of Nietzsche’s claim in On the Genealogy of Morals that “thereis no ‘being’behind doing,effecting,becoming;‘the doer’is merely afiction added to the deed—the deed is everything.”39In an applicationthat Nietzsche himself would not have anticipated or condoned,wemight state as a corollary:There is no gender identity behind theexpressions of gender;that identity is performatively constituted bythe very “expressions”that are said to be its results.vi.Language,Power,and the Strategies ofDisplacementA great deal of feminist theory and literature has nevertheless as-sumed that there is a “doer”behind the deed.Without an agent,it isargued,there can be no agency and hence no potential to initiate a

transformation of relations of domination within society.Wittig’s radi-cal feminist theory occupies an ambiguous position within the continu-um of theories on the question of the subject.On the one hand,Wittigappears to dispute the metaphysics of substance,but on the otherhand,she retains the human subject,the individual,as the metaphysicallocus of agency.While Wittig’s humanism clearly presupposes thatthere is a doer behind the deed,her theory nevertheless delineates theperformative construction of gender within the material practices ofculture,disputing the temporality of those explanations that wouldconfuse “cause”with “result.”In a phrase that suggests the intertextualspace that links Wittig with Foucault (and reveals the traces of theMarxist notion of reification in both of their theories),she writes:A materialist feminist approach shows that what we take for the cause or origin of oppression is in fact only the markimposed by theoppressor;the “myth of woman,”plus its material effects and mani-festations in the appropriated consciousness and bodies of women.Thus,this mark does not preexist oppression ...sex is taken as an “immediate given,”a “sensible given,”“physical features,”belongingto a natural order.But what we believe to be a physical and directperception is only a sophisticated and mythic construction,an “imagi-nary formation.”40Because this production of “nature”operates in accord with the dic-tates of compulsory heterosexuality,the emergence of homosexualdesire,in her view,transcends the categories of sex:“If desire couldliberate itself,it would have nothing to do with the preliminary mark-ing by sexes.”41Wittig refers to “sex”as a mark that is somehow applied by aninstitutionalized heterosexuality,a mark that can be erased or obfus-cated through practices that effectively contest that institution.Herview,of course,differs radically from Irigaray’s.The latter wouldunderstand the “mark”of gender to be part of the hegemonic signifyingeconomy of the masculine that operates through the self-elaborating

mechanisms of specularization that have virtually determined the fieldof ontology within the Western philosophical tradition.For Wittig,language is an instrument or tool that is in no way misogynist in itsstructures,but only in its applications.42For Irigaray,the possibility ofanother language or signifying economy is the only chance at escapingthe “mark”of gender which,for the feminine,is nothing but the phall-ogocentric erasure of the female sex.Whereas Irigaray seeks to exposethe ostensible “binary”relation between the sexes as a masculinist rusethat excludes the feminine altogether,Wittig argues that positions likeIrigaray’s reconsolidate the binary between masculine and feminineand recirculate a mythic notion of the feminine.Clearly drawing onBeauvoir’s critique of the myth of the feminine in The Second Sex,Wittigasserts,“there is no ‘feminine writing.’”43Wittig is clearly attuned to the power of language to subordinateand exclude women.As a “materialist,”however,she considers languageto be “another order of materiality,”44an institution that can be radicallytransformed.Language ranks among the concrete and contingent prac-tices and institutions maintained by the choices of individuals and,hence,weakened by the collective actions of choosing individuals.Thelinguistic fiction of “sex,”she argues,is a category produced and circu-lated by the system of compulsory heterosexuality in an effort torestrict the production of identities along the axis of heterosexualdesire.In some of her work,both male and female homosexuality,aswell as other positions independent of the heterosexual contract,pro-vide the occasion either for the overthrow or the proliferation of thecategory of sex.In The Lesbian Body and elsewhere,however,Wittigappears to take issue with genitally organized sexuality per se and to callfor an alternative economy of pleasures which would both contest theconstruction of female subjectivity marked by women’s supposedly dis-tinctive reproductive function.45Here the proliferation of pleasuresoutside the reproductive economy suggests both a specifically feminineform of erotic diffusion,understood as a counterstrategy to the repro-ductive construction of genitality.In a sense,The Lesbian Body can be

understood,for Wittig,as an “inverted”reading of Freud’s Three Essays onthe Theory of Sexuality,in which he argues for the developmental superi-ority of genital sexuality over and against the less restricted and morediffuse infantile sexuality.Only the “invert,”the medical classificationinvoked by Freud for “the homosexual,”fails to “achieve”the genitalnorm.In waging a political critique against genitality,Wittig appears todeploy “inversion”as a critical reading practice,valorising preciselythose features of an undeveloped sexuality designated by Freud andeffectively inaugurating a “post-genital politics.”46Indeed,the notion ofdevelopment can be read only as normalization within the heterosexualmatrix.And yet,is this the only reading of Freud possible? And to whatextent is Wittig’s practice of “inversion”committed to the very model ofnormalization that she seeks to dismantle? In other words,if the modelof a more diffuse and antigenital sexuality serves as the singular,opposi-tional alternative to the hegemonic structure of sexuality,to whatextent is that binary relation fated to reproduce itself endlessly? Whatpossibility exists for the disruption of the oppositional binary itself?Wittig’s oppositional relationship to psychoanalysis produces theunexpected consequence that her theory presumes precisely that psy-choanalytic theory of development,now fully “inverted,”that she seeksto overcome.Polymorphous perversity,assumed to exist prior to themarking by sex,is valorised as the telos of human sexuality.47One pos-sible feminist psychoanalytic response to Wittig might argue that sheboth undertheorizes and underestimates the meaning and function ofthe language in which “the mark of gender”occurs.She understandsthat marking practice as contingent,radically variable,and even dis-pensable.The status of a primary prohibitionin Lacanian theory oper-ates more forcefully and less contingently than the notion of aregulatory practicein Foucault or a materialist account of a system ofheterosexist oppression in Wittig.In Lacan,as in Irigaray’s post-Lacanian reformulation of Freud,sexual difference is not a simple binary that retains the metaphysics ofsubstance as its foundation.The masculine “subject”is a fictive con-

struction produced by the law that prohibits incest and forces an infi-nite displacement of a heterosexualizing desire.The feminine is never amark of the subject;the feminine could not be an “attribute”of a gen-der.Rather,the feminine is the signification of lack,signified by theSymbolic,a set of differentiating linguistic rules that effectively createsexual difference.The masculine linguistic position undergoes individ-uation and heterosexualization required by the founding prohibitionsof the Symbolic law,the law of the Father.The incest taboo that barsthe son from the mother and thereby instates the kinship relationbetween them is a law enacted “in the name of the Father.”Similarly,the law that refuses the girl’s desire for both her mother and fatherrequires that she take up the emblem of maternity and perpetuate therules of kinship.Both masculine and feminine positions are thus insti-tuted through prohibitive laws that produce culturally intelligible gen-ders,but only through the production of an unconscious sexuality thatreemerges in the domain of the imaginary.48The feminist appropriation of sexual difference,whether written inopposition to the phallogocentrism of Lacan (Irigaray) or as a criticalreelaboration of Lacan,attempts to theorize the feminine,not as anexpression of the metaphysics of substance,but as the unrepresentableabsence effected by (masculine) denial that grounds the signifying econ-omy through exclusion.The feminine as the repudiated/excluded with-in that system constitutes the possibility of a critique and disruption ofthat hegemonic conceptual scheme.The works of Jacqueline Rose49andJane Gallop50underscore in different ways the constructed status ofsexual difference,the inherent instability of that construction,and thedual consequentiality of a prohibition that at once institutes a sexualidentity and provides for the exposure of that construction’s tenuousground.Although Wittig and other materialist feminists within theFrench context would argue that sexual difference is an unthinkingreplication of a reified set of sexed polarities,these criticisms neglectthe critical dimension of the unconscious which,as a site of repressedsexuality,reemerges within the discourse of the subject as the very

impossibility of its coherence.As Rose points out very clearly,the con-struction of a coherent sexual identity along the disjunctive axis of thefeminine/masculine is bound to fail;51the disruptions of this coherencethrough the inadvertent reemergence of the repressed reveal not onlythat “identity”is constructed,but that the prohibition that constructsidentity is inefficacious (the paternal law ought to be understood not asa deterministic divine will,but as a perpetual bumbler,preparing theground for the insurrections against him).The differences between the materialist and Lacanian (and post-Lacanian) positions emerge in a normative quarrel over whether thereis a retrievable sexuality either “before”or “outside”the law in themode of the unconscious or “after”the law as a postgenital sexuality.Paradoxically,the normative trope of polymorphous perversity isunderstood to characterize both views of alternative sexuality.There isno agreement,however,on the manner of delimiting that “law”or setof “laws.”The psychoanalytic critique succeeds in giving an account ofthe construction of “the subject”—and perhaps also the illusion ofsubstance—within the matrix of normative gender relations.In herexistential-materialist mode,Wittig presumes the subject,the person,to have a presocial and pregendered integrity.On the other hand,“thepaternal Law”in Lacan,as well as the monologic mastery of phallogo-centrism in Irigaray,bear the mark of a monotheistic singularity that isperhaps less unitary and culturally universal than the guiding struc-turalist assumptions of the account presume.52But the quarrel seems also to turn on the articulation of a temporaltrope of a subversive sexuality that flourishes priorto the imposition of alaw,afterits overthrow,or during its reign as a constant challenge to itsauthority.Here it seems wise to reinvoke Foucault who,in claiming thatsexuality and power are coextensive,implicitly refutes the postulationof a subversive or emancipatory sexuality which could be free of thelaw.We can press the argument further by pointing out that “the before”of the law and “the after”are discursively and performatively institutedmodes of temporality that are invoked within the terms of a normative

framework which asserts that subversion,destabilization,or displace-ment requires a sexuality that somehow escapes the hegemonic prohibi-tions on sex.For Foucault,those prohibitions are invariably andinadvertently productive in the sense that “the subject”who is supposedto be founded and produced in and through those prohibitions does nothave access to a sexuality that is in some sense “outside,”“before,”or“after”power itself.Power,rather than the law,encompasses both thejuridical (prohibitive and regulatory) and the productive (inadvertentlygenerative) functions of differential relations.Hence,the sexuality thatemerges within the matrix of power relations is not a simple replicationor copy of the law itself,a uniform repetition of a masculinist economyof identity.The productions swerve from their original purposes andinadvertently mobilize possibilities of “subjects”that do not merelyexceed the bounds of cultural intelligibility,but effectively expand theboundaries of what is,in fact,culturally intelligible.The feminist norm of a postgenital sexuality became the object ofsignificant criticism from feminist theorists of sexuality,some of whomhave sought a specifically feminist and/or lesbian appropriation ofFoucault.This utopian notion of a sexuality freed from heterosexualconstructs,a sexuality beyond “sex,”failed to acknowledge the ways inwhich power relations continue to construct sexuality for women evenwithin the terms of a “liberated”heterosexuality or lesbianism.53Thesame criticism is waged against the notion of a specifically feminine sex-ual pleasure that is radically differentiated from phallic sexuality.Irigaray’s occasional efforts to derive a specific feminine sexuality froma specific female anatomy have been the focus of anti-essentialist argu-ments for some time.54The return to biology as the ground of a specificfeminine sexuality or meaning seems to defeat the feminist premise thatbiology is not destiny.But whether feminine sexuality is articulated herethrough a discourse of biology for purely strategic reasons,55or whetherit is,in fact,a feminist return to biological essentialism,the characteri-zation of female sexuality as radically distinct from a phallic organizationof sexuality remains problematic.Women who fail either to recognize

that sexuality as their own or understand their sexuality as partially con-structed within the terms of the phallic economy are potentially writtenoff within the terms of that theory as “male-identified”or “unenlight-ened.”Indeed,it is often unclear within Irigaray’s text whether sexualityis culturally constructed,or whether it is only culturally constructedwithin the terms of the phallus.In other words,is specifically femininepleasure “outside”of culture as its prehistory or as its utopian future? Ifso,of what use is such a notion for negotiating the contemporary strug-gles of sexuality within the terms of its construction?The pro-sexuality movement within feminist theory and practicehas effectively argued that sexuality is always constructed within theterms of discourse and power,where power is partially understood interms of heterosexual and phallic cultural conventions.The emergenceof a sexuality constructed (not determined) in these terms within les-bian,bisexual,and heterosexual contexts is,therefore,nota sign of amasculine identification in some reductive sense.It is not the failedproject of criticizing phallogocentrism or heterosexual hegemony,as ifa political critique could effectively undo the cultural construction ofthe feminist critic’s sexuality.If sexuality is culturally constructedwithin existing power relations,then the postulation of a normativesexuality that is “before,”“outside,”or “beyond”power is a culturalimpossibility and a politically impracticable dream,one that postponesthe concrete and contemporary task of rethinking subversive possibili-ties for sexuality and identity within the terms of power itself.Thiscritical task presumes,of course,that to operate within the matrix ofpower is not the same as to replicate uncritically relations of domina-tion.It offers the possibility of a repetition of the law which is not itsconsolidation,but its displacement.In the place of a “male-identified”sexuality in which “male”serves as the cause and irreducible meaningof that sexuality,we might develop a notion of sexuality constructed interms of phallic relations of power that replay and redistribute the pos-sibilities of that phallicism precisely through the subversive operation of“identifications”that are,within the power field of sexuality,inevitable.

If “identifications,”following Jacqueline Rose,can be exposed as phan-tasmatic,then it must be possible to enact an identification that displaysits phantasmatic structure.If there is no radical repudiation of a cultur-ally constructed sexuality,what is left is the question of how toacknowledge and “do”the construction one is invariably in.Are thereforms of repetition that do not constitute a simple imitation,reproduc-tion,and,hence,consolidation of the law (the anachronistic notion of“male identification”that ought to be discarded from a feminist vocabu-lary)? What possibilities of gender configurations exist among the vari-ous emergent and occasionally convergent matrices of culturalintelligibility that govern gendered life?Within the terms of feminist sexual theory,it is clear that the pres-ence of power dynamics within sexuality is in no sense the same as thesimple consolidation or augmentation of a heterosexist or phallogo-centric power regime.The “presence”of so-called heterosexual con-ventions within homosexual contexts as well as the proliferation ofspecifically gay discourses of sexual difference,as in the case of “butch”and “femme”as historical identities of sexual style,cannot be explainedas chimerical representations of originally heterosexual identities.Andneither can they be understood as the pernicious insistence of hetero-sexist constructs within gay sexuality and identity.The repetition ofheterosexual constructs within sexual cultures both gay and straightmay well be the inevitable site of the denaturalization and mobilizationof gender categories.The replication of heterosexual constructs innon-heterosexual frames brings into relief the utterly constructedstatus of the so-called heterosexual original.Thus,gay is to straight notas copy is to original,but,rather,as copy is to copy.The parodic repe-tition of “the original,”discussed in the final sections of chapter 3 ofthis text,reveals the original to be nothing other than a parody of theideaof the natural and the original.56Even if heterosexist constructscirculate as the available sites of power/discourse from which to dogender at all,the question remains:What possibilities of recirculationexist? Which possibilities of doing gender repeat and displace through

hyperbole,dissonance,internal confusion,and proliferation the veryconstructs by which they are mobilized?Consider not only that the ambiguities and incoherences within andamong heterosexual,homosexual,and bisexual practices are sup-pressed and redescribed within the reified framework of the disjunctiveand asymmetrical binary of masculine/feminine,but that these culturalconfigurations of gender confusion operate as sites for intervention,exposure,and displacement of these reifications.In other words,the“unity”of gender is the effect of a regulatory practice that seeks to ren-der gender identity uniform through a compulsory heterosexuality.Theforce of this practice is,through an exclusionary apparatus of produc-tion,to restrict the relative meanings of “heterosexuality,”“homosexu-ality,”and “bisexuality”as well as the subversive sites of theirconvergence and resignification.That the power regimes of heterosex-ism and phallogocentrism seek to augment themselves through a con-stant repetition of their logic,their metaphysic,and their naturalizedontologies does not imply that repetition itself ought to be stopped—asif it could be.If repetition is bound to persist as the mechanism of thecultural reproduction of identities,then the crucial question emerges:What kind of subversive repetition might call into question the regula-tory practice of identity itself?If there is no recourse to a “person,”a “sex,”or a “sexuality”thatescapes the matrix of power and discursive relations that effectivelyproduce and regulate the intelligibility of those concepts for us,whatconstitutes the possibility of effective inversion,subversion,or dis-placement within the terms of a constructed identity? What possibili-ties exist by virtue of the constructed character of sex and gender?Whereas Foucault is ambiguous about the precise character of the “reg-ulatory practices”that produce the category of sex,and Wittig appearsto invest the full responsibility of the construction to sexual reproduc-tion and its instrument,compulsory heterosexuality,yet other dis-courses converge to produce this categorial fiction for reasons notalways clear or consistent with one another.The power relations that

infuse the biological sciences are not easily reduced,and the medico-legal alliance emerging in nineteenth-century Europe has spawned cat-egorial fictions that could not be anticipated in advance.The verycomplexity of the discursive map that constructs gender appears tohold out the promise of an inadvertent and generative convergence ofthese discursive and regulatory structures.If the regulatory fictions ofsex and gender are themselves multiply contested sites of meaning,then the very multiplicity of their construction holds out the possibilityof a disruption of their univocal posturing.Clearly this project does not propose to lay out within traditionalphilosophical terms an ontologyof gender whereby the meaning of beinga woman or a man is elucidated within the terms of phenomenology.The presumption here is that the “being”of gender is an effect,an objectof a genealogical investigation that maps out the political parameters ofits construction in the mode of ontology.To claim that gender is con-structed is not to assert its illusoriness or artificiality,where thoseterms are understood to reside within a binary that counterposes the“real”and the “authentic”as oppositional.As a genealogy of genderontology,this inquiry seeks to understand the discursive production ofthe plausibility of that binary relation and to suggest that certain cultur-al configurations of gender take the place of “the real”and consolidateand augment their hegemony through that felicitous self-naturalization.If there is something right in Beauvoir’s claim that one is not born,but rather becomesa woman,it follows that womanitself is a term inprocess,a becoming,a constructing that cannot rightfully be said tooriginate or to end.As an ongoing discursive practice,it is open to inter-vention and resignification.Even when gender seems to congeal into themost reified forms,the “congealing”is itself an insistent and insidiouspractice,sustained and regulated by various social means.It is,forBeauvoir,never possible finally to become a woman,as if there were atelosthat governs the process of acculturation and construction.Genderis the repeated stylization of the body,a set of repeated acts within ahighly rigid regulatory frame that congeal over time to produce the

appearance of substance,of a natural sort of being.A political genealogyof gender ontologies,if it is successful,will deconstruct the substantiveappearance of gender into its constitutive acts and locate and account forthose acts within the compulsory frames set by the various forces thatpolice the social appearance of gender.To expose the contingent acts thatcreate the appearance of a naturalistic necessity,a move which has been apart of cultural critique at least since Marx,is a task that now takes onthe added burden of showing how the very notion of the subject,intelli-gible only through its appearance as gendered,admits of possibilities thathave been forcibly foreclosed by the various reifications of gender thathave constituted its contingent ontologies.The following chapter investigates some aspects of the psychoana-lytic structuralist account of sexual difference and the construction ofsexuality with respect to its power to contest the regulatory regimesoutlined here as well as its role in uncritically reproducing thoseregimes.The univocity of sex,the internal coherence of gender,and thebinary framework for both sex and gender are considered throughout asregulatory fictions that consolidate and naturalize the convergent powerregimes of masculine and heterosexist oppression.The final chapterconsiders the very notion of “the body,”not as a ready surface awaitingsignification,but as a set of boundaries,individual and social,politicallysignified and maintained.No longer believable as an interior “truth”ofdispositions and identity,sex will be shown to be a performativelyenacted signification (and hence not “to be”),one that,released from itsnaturalized interiority and surface,can occasion the parodic prolifera-tion and subversive play of gendered meanings.This text continues,then,as an effort to think through the possibility of subverting and dis-placing those naturalized and reified notions of gender that supportmasculine hegemony and heterosexist power,to make gender trouble,not through the strategies that figure a utopian beyond,but through themobilization,subversive confusion,and proliferation of precisely thoseconstitutive categories that seek to keep gender in its place by posturingas the foundational illusions of identity.

2 Prohibition,Psychoanalysis,and the Production of the Heterosexual MatrixThe straight mind continues to affirm that incest,and not homosexualityrepresents its major interdiction.Thus,when thought by the straightmind,homosexuality is nothing but heterosexuality.—Monique Wittig,“The Straight Mind”On occasion feminist theory has been drawn to the thought of an origin,a time before what some would call “patriarchy”that would provide animaginary perspective from which to establish the contingency of thehistory of women’s oppression.Debates have emerged over whetherprepatriarchal cultures have existed,whether they were matriarchal ormatrilineal in structure,whether patriarchy could be shown to have abeginning and,hence,be subject to an end.The critical impetus behindthese kinds of inquiry sought understandably to show that the antifemi-nist argument in favor of the inevitability of patriarchy constituted areification and naturalization of a historical and contingent phenomenon.Although the turn to a prepatriarchal state of culture was intendedto expose the self-reification of patriarchy,that prepatriarchal schemehas proven to be a different sort of reification.More recently,somefeminists have offered a reflexive critique of some reified constructswithin feminism itself.The very notion of “patriarchy”has threatened to become a universalizing concept that overrides or reduces distinct

articulations of gender asymmetry in different cultural contexts.Asfeminism has sought to become integrally related to struggles againstracial and colonialist oppression,it has become increasingly importantto resist the colonizing epistemological strategy that would subordi-nate different configurations of domination under the rubric of a tran-scultural notion of patriarchy.The articulation of the law of patriarchyas a repressive and regulatory structure also requires reconsiderationfrom this critical perspective.The feminist recourse to an imaginarypast needs to be cautious not to promote a politically problematicreification of women’s experience in the course of debunking the self-reifying claims of masculinist power.The self-justification of a repressive or subordinating law almostalways grounds itself in a story about what it was like before the advent ofthe law,and how it came about that the law emerged in its present andnecessary form.1 The fabrication of those origins tends to describe astate of affairs before the law that follows a necessary and unilinear nar-rative that culminates in,and thereby justifies,the constitution of thelaw.The story of origins is thus a strategic tactic within a narrative that,by telling a single,authoritative account about an irrecoverable past,makes the constitution of the law appear as a historical inevitability.Some feminists have found in the prejuridical past traces of autopian future,a potential resource for subversion or insurrection thatpromises to lead to the destruction of the law and the instatement of anew order.But if the imaginary “before”is inevitably figured within theterms of a prehistorical narrative that serves to legitimate the presentstate of the law or,alternatively,the imaginary future beyond the law,then this “before”is always already imbued with the self-justificatoryfabrications of present and future interests,whether feminist orantifeminist.The postulation of the “before”within feminist theorybecomes politically problematic when it constrains the future to mate-rialize an idealized notion of the past or when it supports,even inad-vertently,the reification of a precultural sphere of the authenticfeminine.This recourse to an original or genuine femininity is a nostal-

gic and parochial ideal that refuses the contemporary demand to for-mulate an account of gender as a complex cultural construction.Thisideal tends not only to serve culturally conservative aims,but to con-stitute an exclusionary practice within feminism,precipitating precise-ly the kind of fragmentation that the ideal purports to overcome.Throughout the speculation of Engels,socialist feminism,thosefeminist positions rooted in structuralist anthropology,there emergevarious efforts to locate moments or structures within history or cul-ture that establish gender hierarchy.The isolation of such structures orkey periods is pursued in order to repudiate those reactionary theorieswhich would naturalize or universalize the subordination of women.As significant efforts to provide a critical displacement of the univer-salizing gestures of oppression,these theories constitute part of thecontemporary theoretical field in which a further contestation ofoppression is taking place.The question needs to be pursued,however,whether these powerful critiques of gender hierarchy make use of pre-suppositional fictions that entail problematic normative ideals.Lévi-Strauss’s structuralist anthropology,including the problemat-ic nature/culture distinction,has been appropriated by some feministtheorists to support and elucidate the sex/gender distinction:the posi-tion that there is a natural or biological female who is subsequentlytransformed into a socially subordinate “woman,”with the conse-quence that “sex”is to nature or “the raw”as gender is to culture or“the cooked.”If Lévi-Strauss’s framework were true,it would be possi-ble to trace the transformation of sex into gender by locating that sta-ble mechanism of cultures,the exchange rules of kinship,which effectthat transformation in fairly regular ways.Within such a view,“sex”isbefore the law in the sense that it is culturally and political undeter-mined,providing the “raw material”of culture,as it were,that beginsto signify only through and after its subjection to the rules of kinship.This very concept of sex-as-matter,sex-as-instrument-of-cultural-signification,however,is a discursive formation that acts as a naturalizedfoundation for the nature/culture distinction and the strategies of

domination that that distinction supports.The binary relation betweenculture and nature promotes a relationship of hierarchy in whichculture freely “imposes”meaning on nature,and,hence,renders it into an “Other”to be appropriated to its own limitless uses,safeguard-ing the ideality of the signifier and the structure of signification on themodel of domination.Anthropologists Marilyn Strathern and Carol MacCormack haveargued that nature/culture discourse regularly figures nature asfemale,in need of subordination by a culture that is invariably figuredas male,active,and abstract.2 As in the existential dialectic of misogy-ny,this is yet another instance in which reason and mind are associatedwith masculinity and agency,while the body and nature are consideredto be the mute facticity of the feminine,awaiting signification from anopposing masculine subject.As in that misogynist dialectic,materialityand meaning are mutually exclusive terms.The sexual politics thatconstruct and maintain this distinction are effectively concealed by thediscursive production of a nature and,indeed,a natural sex that pos-tures as the unquestioned foundation of culture.Critics of structural-ism such as Clifford Geertz have argued that its universalizingframework discounts the multiplicity of cultural configurations of“nature.”The analysis that assumes nature to be singular and prediscur-sive cannot ask,what qualifies as “nature”within a given cultural con-text,and for what purposes? Is the dualism necessary at all? How arethe sex/gender and nature/culture dualisms constructed and natural-ized in and through one another? What gender hierarchies do theyserve,and what relations of subordination do they reify? If the verydesignation of sex is political,then “sex,”that designation supposed tobe most in the raw,proves to be always already “cooked,”and the cen-tral distinctions of structuralist anthropology appear to collapse.3The effort to locate a sexed nature before the law seems to berooted understandably in the more fundamental project to be able tothink that the patriarchal law is not universally true and all-determining.Indeed,if constructed gender is all there is,then there appears to be

no “outside,”no epistemic anchor in a precultural “before”that mightserve as an alternative epistemic point of departure for a criticalassessment of existing gender relations.Locating the mechanismwhereby sex is transformed into gender is meant to establish not onlythe constructedness of gender,its unnatural and nonnecessary status,but the cultural universality of oppression in nonbiologistic terms.How is this mechanism formulated? Can it be found or merely imag-ined? Is the designation of its ostensible universality any less of a reifi-cation than the position that grounds universal oppression in biology?Only when the mechanism of gender construction implies the con-tingency of that construction does “constructedness”per se prove usefulto the political project to enlarge the scope of possible gender configu-rations.If,however,it is a life of the body beyond the law or a recoveryof the body before the law which then emerges as the normative goalof feminist theory,such a norm effectively takes the focus of feministtheory away from the concrete terms of contemporary cultural strug-gle.Indeed,the following sections on psychoanalysis,structuralism,and the status and power of their gender-instituting prohibitions cen-ters precisely on this notion of the law:What is its ontological status—is it juridical,oppressive,and reductive in its workings,or does itinadvertently create the possibility of its own cultural displacement? Towhat extent does the articulation of a body prior to articulation per-formatively contradict itself and spawn alternatives in its place?i.Structuralism’s Critical ExchangeStructuralist discourse tends to refer to the Law in the singular,inaccord with Lévi-Strauss’s contention that there is a universal structureof regulating exchange that characterizes all systems of kinship.According to The Elementary Structures of Kinship,the object of exchangethat both consolidates and differentiates kinship relations is women,given as gifts from one patrilineal clan to another through the institu-tion of marriage.4 The bride,the gift,the object of exchange constitutes“a sign and a value”that opens a channel of exchange that not only

serves the functional purpose of facilitating trade but performs the sym-bolic or ritualistic purpose of consolidating the internal bonds,the col-lective identity,of each clan differentiated through the act.5 In otherwords,the bride functions as a relational term between groups of men;she does not have an identity,and neither does she exchange one identi-ty for another.She reflects masculine identity precisely through beingthe site of its absence.Clan members,invariably male,invoke the pre-rogative of identity through marriage,a repeated act of symbolic differ-entiation.Exogamy distinguishes and binds patronymically specifickinds of men.Patrilineality is secured through the ritualistic expulsionof women and,reciprocally,the ritualistic importation of women.Aswives,women not only secure the reproduction of the name (the func-tional purpose),but effect a symbolic intercourse between clans ofmen.As the site of a patronymic exchange,women are and are not thepatronymic sign,excluded from the signifier,the very patronym theybear.The woman in marriage qualifies not as an identity,but only as arelational term that both distinguishes and binds the various clans to acommon but internally differentiated patrilineal identity.The structural systematicity of Lévi-Strauss’s explanation of kin-ship relations appeals to a universal logic that appears to structurehuman relations.Although Lévi-Strauss reports in Tristes tropiques thathe left philosophy because anthropology provided a more concretecultural texture to the analysis of human life,he nevertheless assimi-lates that cultural texture to a totalizing logical structure that effec-tively returns his analyses to the decontextualized philosophicalstructures he purported to leave.Although a number of questions canbe raised about the presumptions of universality in Lévi-Strauss’s work(as they are in anthropologist Clifford Geertz’s Local Knowledge),thequestions here concern the place of identitarian assumptions in thisuniversal logic and the relationship of that identitarian logic to the sub-ordinate status of women within the cultural reality that this logicdescribes.If the symbolic nature of exchange is its universally humancharacter as well,and if that universal structure distributes “identity”

to male persons and a subordinate and relational “negation”or “lack”towomen,then this logic might well be contested by a position or set ofpositions excluded from its very terms.What might an alternativelogic of kinship be like? To what extent do identitarian logical systemsalways require the construction of socially impossible identities tooccupy an unnamed,excluded,but presuppositional relation subse-quently concealed by the logic itself? Here the impetus for Irigaray’smarking off of the phallogocentric economy becomes clear,as does amajor poststructuralist impulse within feminism that questionswhether an effective critique of phallogocentrism requires a displace-ment of the Symbolic as defined by Lévi-Strauss.The totality and closure of language is both presumed and contestedwithin structuralism.Although Saussure understands the relationshipof signifier and signified to be arbitrary,he places this arbitrary relationwithin a necessarily complete linguistic system.All linguistic termspresuppose a linguistic totality of structures,the entirety of which ispresupposed and implicitly recalled for any one term to bear meaning.This quasi-Leibnizian view,in which language figures as a systematictotality,effectively suppresses the moment of difference between sig-nifier and signified,relating and unifying that moment of arbitrarinesswithin a totalizing field.The poststructuralist break with Saussure andwith the identitarian structures of exchange found in Lévi-Straussrefutes the claims of totality and universality and the presumption ofbinary structural oppositions that implicitly operate to quell the insis-tent ambiguity and openness of linguistic and cultural signification.6 Asa result,the discrepancy between signifier and signified becomes theoperative and limitless différance of language,rendering all referentiali-ty into a potentially limitless displacement.For Lévi-Strauss,the masculine cultural identity is establishedthrough an overt act of differentiation between patrilineal clans,wherethe “difference”in this relation is Hegelian—that is,one which simul-taneously distinguishes and binds.But the “difference”establishedbetween men and the women who effect the differentiation between

men eludes the dialectic altogether.In other words,the differentiatingmoment of social exchange appears to be a social bond between men,aHegelian unity between masculine terms that are simultaneously spec-ified and individualized.7 On an abstract level,this is an identity-in-difference,since both clans retain a similar identity:male,patriar-chal,and patrilineal.Bearing different names,they particularize them-selves within this all-encompassing masculine cultural identity.Butwhat relation instates women as the object of exchange,clothed first in one patronym and then another? What kind of differentiatingmechanism distributes gender functions in this way? What kind of dif-ferentiating différance is presupposed and excluded by the explicit,male-mediating negation of Lévi-Strauss’s Hegelian economy? AsIrigaray argues,this phallogocentric economy depends essentially onan economy of différance that is never manifest,but always both pre-supposed and disavowed.In effect,the relations among patrilinealclans are based in homosocial desire (what Irigaray punningly calls“hommo-sexuality”),8a repressed and,hence,disparaged sexuality,arelationship between men which is,finally,about the bonds of men,but which takes place through the heterosexual exchange and distribu-tion of women.9In a passage that reveals the homoerotic unconscious of the phallo-gocentric economy,Lévi-Strauss offers the link between the incesttaboo and the consolidation of homoerotic bonds:Exchange—and consequently the rule of exogamy—is not simply that of goods exchanged.Exchange—and consequently the rule ofexogamy that expresses it—has in itself a social value.It provides themeans of binding men together.The taboo generates exogamic heterosexuality which Lévi-Straussunderstands as the artificial accomplishment of a nonincestuous het-erosexuality extracted through prohibition from a more natural andunconstrained sexuality (an assumption shared by Freud in Three Essayson the Theory of Sexuality).

The relation of reciprocity established between men,however,is the condition of a relation of radical nonreciprocity between men and women and a relation,as it were,of nonrelation between women.Lévi-Strauss’s notorious claim that “the emergence of symbolic thoughtmust have required that women,like words,should be things that wereexchanged,”suggests a necessity that Lévi-Strauss himself induces fromthe presumed universal structures of culture from the retrospectiveposition of a transparent observer.But the “must have”appears as aninference only to function as a performative;since the moment inwhich the symbolic emerged could not be one that Lévi-Strauss wit-nessed,he conjectures a necessary history:The report therebybecomes an injunction.His analysis prompted Irigaray to reflect onwhat would happen if “the goods got together”and revealed the unan-ticipated agency of an alternative sexual economy.Her recent work,Sexes et parentés,10offers a critical exegesis of how this construction ofreciprocal exchange between men presupposes a nonreciprocitybetween the sexes inarticulable within that economy,as well as theunnameability of the female,the feminine,and lesbian sexuality.If there is a sexual domain that is excludedfrom the Symbolic andcan potentially expose the Symbolic as hegemonic rather than totaliz-ing in its reach,it must then be possible to locate this excluded domaineither within or outside that economy and to strategize its interven-tion in terms of that placement.The following rereading of the struc-turalist law and the narrative that accounts for the production of sexualdifference within its terms centers on the presumed fixity and univer-sality of that law and,through a genealogical critique,seeks to exposethat law’s powers of inadvertent and self-defeating generativity.Does“the Law”produce these positions unilaterally or invariably? Can itproduce configurations of sexuality that effectively contest the lawitself,or are those contests inevitably phantasmatic? Can the generativi-tyof that law be specified as variable or even subversive?The law forbidding incest is the locus of this economy of kinshipthat forbids endogamy.Lévi-Strauss maintains that the centrality of the

54

incest taboo establishes the significant nexus between structuralistanthropology and psychoanalysis.Although Lévi-Strauss acknowledgesthat Freud’s Totem and Taboo has been discredited on empirical grounds,he considers that repudiating gesture as paradoxical evidence in sup-port of Freud’s thesis.Incest,for Lévi-Strauss,is not a social fact,but apervasive cultural fantasy.Presuming the heterosexual masculinity ofthe subject of desire,Lévi-Strauss maintains that “the desire for themother or the sister,the murder of the father and the sons’repentanceundoubtedly do not correspond to any fact or group of facts occupyinga given place in history.But perhaps they symbolically express anancient and lasting dream.”11In an effort to affirm the psychoanalytic insight into unconsciousincestuous fantasy,Lévi-Strauss refers to the “magic of this dream,itspower to mould men’s thoughts unbeknown to them ...the acts itevokes have never been committed,because culture opposes them atall times and all places.”12This rather astonishing statement providesinsight not only into Lévi-Strauss’s apparent powers of denial (acts ofincest “have never been committed”!),but the central difficulty withassuming the efficacy of that prohibition.That the prohibition exists inno way suggests that it works.Rather,its existence appears to suggestthat desires,actions,indeed,pervasive social practices of incest aregenerated precisely in virtue of the eroticization of that taboo.Thatincestuous desires are phantasmatic in no way implies that they are notalso “social facts.”The question is,rather,how do such phantasmsbecome generated and,indeed,instituted as a consequence of theirprohibition? Further,how does the social conviction,here sympto-matically articulated through Lévi-Strauss,that the prohibition iseffi-cacious disavow and,hence,clear a social space in which incestuouspractices are free to reproduce themselves without proscription?For Lévi-Strauss,the taboo against the act of heterosexual incestbetween son and mother as well as that incestuous fantasy are instated as universal truths of culture.How is incestuous heterosexualityconstituted as the ostensibly natural and pre-artificial matrix for desire,




and how is desire established as a heterosexual male prerogative? Thenaturalization of both heterosexuality and masculine sexual agency are discursive constructions nowhere accounted for but everywhereassumed within this founding structuralist frame.The Lacanian appropriation of Lévi-Strauss focuses on the pro-hibition against incest and the rule of exogamy in the reproduction ofculture,where culture is understood primarily as a set of linguisticstructures and significations.For Lacan,the Law which forbids theincestuous union between boy and mother initiates the structures ofkinship,a series of highly regulated libidinal displacements that takeplace through language.Although the structures of language,collec-tively understood as the Symbolic,maintain an ontological integrityapart from the various speaking agents through whom they work,theLaw reasserts and individuates itself within the terms of every infantileentrance into culture.Speech emerges only upon the condition of dis-satisfaction,where dissatisfaction is instituted through incestuous pro-hibition;the original jouissanceis lost through the primary repressionthat founds the subject.In its place emerges the sign which is similarlybarred from the signifier and which seeks in what it signifies a recoveryof that irrecoverable pleasure.Founded through that prohibition,thesubject speaks only to displace desire onto the metonymic substitu-tions for that irretrievable pleasure.Language is the residue and alter-native accomplishment of dissatisfied desire,the variegated culturalproduction of a sublimation that never really satisfies.That languageinevitably fails to signify is the necessary consequence of the prohibi-tion which grounds the possibility of language and marks the vanity ofits referential gestures.ii.Lacan,Riviere,and the Strategies of MasqueradeTo ask after the “being”of gender and/or sex in Lacanian terms is toconfound the very purpose of Lacan’s theory of language.Lacan dis-putes the primacy given to ontology within the terms of Westernmetaphysics and insists upon the subordination of the question 

Prohibition,Psychoanalysis,and the Heterosexual Matrix

55




“What is/has being?”to the prior question “How is ‘being’institutedand allocated through the signifying practices of the paternal econo-my?”The ontological specification of being,negation,and their rela-tions is understood to be determined by a language structured by thepaternal law and its mechanisms of differentiation.A thing takes on thecharacterization of “being”and becomes mobilized by that ontologicalgesture only within a structure of signification that,as the Symbolic,isitself pre-ontological.There is no inquiry,then,into ontology per se,no access to being,without a prior inquiry into the “being”of the Phallus,the authorizingsignification of the Law that takes sexual difference as a presuppositionof its own intelligibility.“Being”the Phallus and “having”the Phallusdenote divergent sexual positions,or nonpositions (impossible posi-tions,really),within language.To “be”the Phallus is to be the “signifi-er”of the desire of the Other and to appear as this signifier.In otherwords,it is to be the object,the Other of a (heterosexualized) mascu-line desire,but also to represent or reflect that desire.This is an Otherthat constitutes,not the limit of masculinity in a feminine alterity,butthe site of a masculine self-elaboration.For women to “be”the Phallusmeans,then,to reflect the power of the Phallus,to signify that power,to “embody”the Phallus,to supply the site to which it penetrates,andto signify the Phallus through “being”its Other,its absence,its lack,thedialectical confirmation of its identity.By claiming that the Other thatlacks the Phallus is the one who is the Phallus,Lacan clearly suggeststhat power is wielded by this feminine position of not-having,that themasculine subject who “has”the Phallus requires this Other to confirmand,hence,be the Phallus in its “extended”sense.13This ontological characterization presupposes that the appearanceor effect of being is always produced through the structures of signifi-cation.The Symbolic order creates cultural intelligibility through themutually exclusive positions of “having”the Phallus (the position ofmen) and “being”the Phallus (the paradoxical position of women).Theinterdependency of these positions recalls the Hegelian structure of

56




failed reciprocity between master and slave,in particular,the unex-pected dependency of the master on the slave in order to establish hisown identity through reflection.14Lacan casts that drama,however,ina phantasmatic domain.Every effort to establish identity within theterms of this binary disjunction of “being”and “having”returns to theinevitable “lack”and “loss”that ground their phantasmatic constructionand mark the incommensurability of the Symbolic and the real.If the Symbolic is understood as a culturally universal structure ofsignification that is nowhere fully instantiated in the real,it makes senseto ask:What or who is it that signifies what or whom in this ostensiblycrosscultural affair? This question,however,is posed within a framethat presupposes a subject as signifier and an object as signified,the tra-ditional epistemological dichotomy within philosophy prior to thestructuralist displacement of the subject.Lacan calls into question thisscheme of signification.He poses the relation between the sexes interms that reveal the speaking “I”as a masculinized effect of repression,one which postures as an autonomous and self-grounding subject,butwhose very coherence is called into question by the sexual positionsthat it excludes in the process of identity formation.For Lacan,thesubject comes into being—that is,begins to posture as a self-groundingsignifier within language—only on the condition of a primary repres-sion of the pre-individuated incestuous pleasures associated with the(now repressed) maternal body.The masculine subject only appearsto originate meanings andthereby to signify.His seemingly self-grounded autonomy attempts to conceal the repression which is both its ground and the perpetualpossibility of its own ungrounding.But that process of meaning-constitution requires that women reflect that masculine power andeverywhere reassure that power of the reality of its illusory autonomy.This task is confounded,to say the least,when the demand that womenreflect the autonomous power of masculine subject/signifier becomesessential to the construction of that autonomy and,thus,becomes thebasis of a radical dependency that effectively undercuts the function it

Prohibition,Psychoanalysis,and the Heterosexual Matrix

57




serves.But further,this dependency,although denied,is also pursuedbythe masculine subject,for the woman as reassuring sign is the displacedmaternal body,the vain but persistent promise of the recovery of pre-individuated jouissance.The conflict of masculinity appears,then,to beprecisely the demand for a full recognition of autonomy that will alsoand nevertheless promise a return to those full pleasures prior torepression and individuation.Women are said to “be”the Phallus in the sense that they maintainthe power to reflect or represent the “reality”of the self-groundingpostures of the masculine subject,a power which,if withdrawn,wouldbreak up the foundational illusions of the masculine subject position.In order to “be”the Phallus,the reflector and guarantor of an apparentmasculine subject position,women must become,must “be”(in thesense of “posture as if they were”) precisely what men are not and,intheir very lack,establish the essential function of men.Hence,“being”the Phallus is always a “being for”a masculine subject who seeks toreconfirm and augment his identity through the recognition of that“being for.”In a strong sense,Lacan disputes the notion that mensignifythe meaning of womenor that womensignify the meaning of men.Thedivision and exchange between this “being”and “having”the Phallus isestablished by the Symbolic,the paternal law.Part of the comedicdimension of this failed model of reciprocity,of course,is that bothmasculine and feminine positions are signified,the signifier belongingto the Symbolic that can never be assumed in more than token form byeither position.To bethe Phallus is to be signified by the paternal law,to be both itsobject and its instrument and,in structuralist terms,the “sign”andpromise of its power.Hence,as the constituted or signified object ofexchange through which the paternal law extends its power and themode in which it appears,women are said to be the Phallus,that is,theemblem of its continuing circulation.But this “being”the Phallus isnecessarily dissatisfying to the extent that women can never fullyreflect that law;some feminists argue that it requires a renunciation of

58




women’s own desire (a double renunciation,in fact,corresponding tothe “double wave”of repression that Freud claimed founds feminini-ty),15which is the expropriation of that desire as the desire to benothing other than a reflection,a guarantor of the pervasive necessityof the Phallus.On the other hand,men are said to “have”the Phallus,yet never to“be”it,in the sense that the penis is not equivalent to that Law and can never fully symbolize that Law.Hence,there is a necessary or pre-suppositional impossibility to any effort to occupy the position of “hav-ing”the Phallus,with the consequence that both positions of “having”and “being”are,in Lacan’s terms,finally to be understood as comedicfailures that are nevertheless compelled to articulate and enact theserepeated impossibilities.But how does a woman “appear”to be the Phallus,the lack thatembodies and affirms the Phallus? According to Lacan,this is donethrough masquerade,the effect of a melancholy that is essential to thefeminine position as such.In his early essay,“The Meaning of thePhallus,”he writes of “the relations between the sexes”:Let us say that these relations will revolve around a being and ahaving which,because they refer to a signifier,the phallus,have thecontradictory effect of on the one hand lending reality to the subjectin that signifier,and on the other making unreal the relations to besignified.16In the lines that directly follow this sentence,Lacan appears torefer to the appearance of the “reality”of the masculine subject as wellas to the “unreality”of heterosexuality.He also appears to refer to theposition of women (my interruption is within brackets):“This followsfrom the intervention of an ‘appearing’which gets substituted for the‘having’[a substitution is required,no doubt,because women are saidnot “to have”] so as to protect it on one side and to mask its lack on the other.”Although there is no grammatical gender here,it seems that Lacan is describing the position of women for whom “lack”is

characteristic and,hence,in need of masking and who are in someunspecified sense in need of protection.Lacan then states that this situ-ation produces “the effect that the ideal or typical manifestations ofbehaviour in both sexes,up to and including the act of sexual copula-tion,are entirely propelled into comedy”(84).Lacan continues this exposition of heterosexual comedy by ex-plaining that this “appearing as being”the Phallus that women are com-pelled to do is inevitably masquerade.The term is significant because itsuggests contradictory meanings:On the one hand,if the “being,”theontological specification of the Phallus,is masquerade,then it wouldappear to reduce all being to a form of appearing,the appearance ofbeing,with the consequence that all gender ontology is reducible tothe play of appearances.On the other hand,masquerade suggests thatthere is a “being”or ontological specification of femininity prior to themasquerade,a feminine desire or demand that is masked and capableof disclosure,that,indeed,might promise an eventual disruption anddisplacement of the phallogocentric signifying economy.At least two very different tasks can be discerned from theambiguous structure of Lacan’s analysis.On the one hand,masquerademay be understood as the performative production of a sexual ontol-ogy,an appearing that makes itself convincing as a “being”;on the otherhand,masquerade can be read as a denial of a feminine desire that pre-supposes some prior ontological femininity regularly unrepresentedby the phallic economy.Irigaray remarks in such a vein that “the mas-querade ...is what women do ...in order to participate in man’sdesire,but at the cost of giving up their own.”17The former task wouldengage a critical reflection on gender ontology as parodic (de)con-struction and,perhaps,pursue the mobile possibilities of the slipperydistinction between “appearing”and “being,”a radicalization of the“comedic”dimension of sexual ontology only partially pursued byLacan.The latter would initiate feminist strategies of unmasking inorder to recover or release whatever feminine desire has remainedsuppressed within the terms of the phallic economy.18

Perhaps these alternative directions are not as mutually exclusiveas they appear,since appearances become more suspect all the time.Reflections on the meaning of masquerade in Lacan as well as in JoanRiviere’s “Womanliness as a Masquerade”have differed greatly in theirinterpretations of what precisely is masked by masquerade.Is mas-querade the consequence of a feminine desire that must be negatedand,thus,made into a lack that,nevertheless,must appear in someway? Is masquerade the consequence of a denial ofthis lack for the pur-pose of appearing to be the Phallus? Does masquerade construct femi-ninity as the reflection of the Phallus in order to disguise bisexualpossibilities that otherwise might disrupt the seamless construction ofa heterosexualized femininity? Does masquerade,as Riviere suggests,transform aggression and the fear of reprisal into seduction and flirta-tion? Does it serve primarily to conceal or repress a pregiven feminin-ity,a feminine desire which would establish an insubordinate alterityto the masculine subject and expose the necessary failure of masculini-ty? Or is masquerade the means by which femininity itself is firstestab-lished,the exclusionary practice of identity formation in which themasculine is effectively excluded and instated as outside the bound-aries of a feminine gendered position?Lacan continues the quotation cited above:Paradoxical as this formulation might seem,it is in order to be thephallus,that is,the signifier of the desire of the Other,that the womanwill reject an essential part of her femininity,notably all its attributesthrough masquerade.It is for what she is not that she expects to bedesired as well as loved.But she finds the signifier of her own desire inthe body of the one to whom she addresses her demand for love.Certainly we should not forget that the organ invested with this signi-fying function takes on the value of a fetish.(84)If this unnamed “organ,”presumably the penis (treated like the HebraicYahweh,never to be spoken),is a fetish,why should it be that we mightso easily forget it,as Lacan himself assumes? And what is the “essential

part of her femininity”that must be rejected? Is it the,again,unnamedpart which,once rejected,appears as a lack? Or is it the lack itself thatmust be rejected,so that she might appear as the Phallus itself? Is theunnameability of this “essential part”the same unnameability thatattends the male “organ”that we are always in danger of forgetting? Isthis precisely that forgetfulness that constitutes the repression at thecore of feminine masquerade? Is it a presumed masculinity that mustbe forfeited in order to appear as the lack that confirms and,therefore,is the Phallus,or is it a phallic possibility,that must be negated in orderto be that lack that confirms?Lacan clarifies his own position as he remarks that “the function ofthe mask ...dominates the identifications through which refusals oflove are resolved”(85).In other words,the mask is part of the incor-porative strategy of melancholy,the taking on of attributes of theobject/Other that is lost,where loss is the consequence of a refusal oflove.19That the mask “dominates”as well as “resolves”these refusalssuggests that appropriation is the strategy through which those refusalsare themselves refused,a double negation that redoubles the structureof identity through the melancholic absorption of the one who is,ineffect,twice lost.Significantly,Lacan locates the discussion of the mask in conjunc-tion with an account of female homosexuality.He claims that “the ori-entation of feminine homosexuality,as observation shows,follows froma disappointment which reenforces the side of the demand for love”(85).Who is observing and what is being observed are convenientlyelided here,but Lacan takes his commentary to be obvious to anyonewho cares to look.What one sees through “observation”is the foundingdisappointment of the female homosexual,where this disappointmentrecalls the refusals that are dominated/resolved through masquerade.One also “observes”somehow that the female homosexual is subject toa strengthened idealization,a demand for love that is pursued at theexpense of desire.Lacan continues this paragraph on “feminine homosexuality”with

the statement partially quoted above:“These remarks should be quali-fied by going back to the function of the mask [which is] to dominatethe identifications through which refusals of love are resolved,”and iffemale homosexuality is understood as a consequenceof a disappoint-ment “as observation shows,”then this disappointment must appear,and appear clearly,in order to be observed.If Lacan presumes thatfemale homosexuality issues from a disappointed heterosexuality,asobservation is said to show,could it not be equally clear to the observ-er that heterosexuality issues from a disappointed homosexuality? Is itthe mask of the female homosexual that is “observed,”and if so,whatclearly readable expression gives evidence of that “disappointment”and that “orientation”as well as the displacement of desire by the (ide-alized) demand for love? Lacan is perhaps suggesting that what is clearto observation is the desexualized status of the lesbian,the incorpora-tion of a refusal that appears as the absence of desire.20But we canunderstand this conclusion to be the necessary result of a heterosexu-alized and masculine observational point of view that takes lesbian sex-uality to be a refusal of sexuality per seonly because sexuality ispresumed to be heterosexual,and the observer,here constructed asthe heterosexual male,is clearly being refused.Indeed,is this accountnot the consequence of a refusal that disappoints the observer,andwhose disappointment,disavowed and projected,is made into theessential character of the women who effectively refuse him?In a characteristic gliding over pronomial locations,Lacan fails tomake clear who refuses whom.As readers,we are meant,however,tounderstand that this free-floating “refusal”is linked in a significant wayto the mask.If every refusal is,finally,a loyalty to some other bond inthe present or the past,refusal is simultaneously preservation as well.The mask thus conceals this loss,but preserves (and negates) this loss through its concealment.The mask has a double function which is the double function of melancholy.The mask is taken on through the process of incorporation which is a way of inscribing and thenwearing a melancholic identification in and on the body;in effect,it is

the signification of the body in the mold of the Other who has beenrefused.Dominated through appropriation,every refusal fails,and therefuser becomes part of the very identity of the refused,indeed,becomes the psychic refuse of the refused.The loss of the object isnever absolute because it is redistributed within a psychic/corporealboundary that expands to incorporate that loss.This locates theprocess of gender incorporation within the wider orbit of melancholy.Published in 1929,Joan Riviere’s essay,“Womanliness as a Mas-querade,”21introduces the notion of femininity as masquerade in termsof a theory of aggression and conflict resolution.This theory appears atfirst to be far afield from Lacan’s analysis of masquerade in terms of thecomedy of sexual positions.She begins with a respectful review ofErnest Jones’s typology of the development of female sexuality intoheterosexual and homosexual forms.She focuses,however,on the“intermediate types”that blur the boundaries between the heterosexualand the homosexual and,implicitly,contest the descriptive capacity ofJones’s classificatory system.In a remark that resonates with Lacan’sfacile reference to “observation,”Riviere seeks recourse to mundaneperception or experience to validate her focus on these “intermediatetypes”:“In daily life types of men and women are constantly met withwho,while mainly heterosexual in their development,plainly displaystrong features of the other sex”(35).What is here most plain is theclassifications that condition and structure the perception of this mix ofattributes.Clearly,Riviere begins with set notions about what it is todisplay characteristics of one’s sex,and how it is that those plain charac-teristics are understood to express or reflect an ostensible sexual orien-tation.22This perception or observation not only assumes a correlationamong characteristics,desires,and “orientations,”23but creates thatunity through the perceptual act itself.Riviere’s postulated unitybetween gender attributes and a naturalized “orientation”appears as aninstance of what Wittig refers to as the “imaginary formation”of sex.And yet,Riviere calls into question these naturalized typologiesthrough an appeal to a psychoanalytic account that locates the meaning

of mixed gender attributes in the “interplay of conflicts”(35).Signifi-cantly,she contrasts this kind of psychoanalytic theory with one thatwould reduce the presence of ostensibly “masculine”attributes in awoman to a “radical or fundamental tendency.”In other words,theacquisition of such attributes and the accomplishment of a heterosexualor homosexual orientation are produced through the resolution of con-flicts that have as their aim the suppression of anxiety.Citing Ferenczi inorder to establish an analogy with her own account,Riviere writes:Ferenczi pointed out ...that homosexual men exaggerate theirheterosexuality as a ‘defence’against their homosexuality.I shallattempt to show that women who wish for masculinity may put on amask of womanliness to avert anxiety and the retribution fearedfrom men.(35)It is unclear what is the “exaggerated”form of heterosexuality thehomosexual man is alleged to display,but the phenomenon undernotice here might simply be that gay men simply may not look muchdifferent from their heterosexual counterparts.This lack of an overtdifferentiating style or appearance may be diagnosed as a symptomatic“defense”only because the gay man in question does not conform tothe idea of the homosexual that the analyst has drawn and sustainedfrom cultural stereotypes.A Lacanian analysis might argue that thesupposed “exaggeration”in the homosexual man of whatever attributescount as apparent heterosexuality is the attempt to “have”the Phallus,the subject position that entails an active and heterosexualized desire.Similarly,the “mask”of the “women who wish for masculinity”can beinterpreted as an effort to renounce the “having”of the Phallus in orderto avert retribution by those from whom it must have been procuredthrough castration.Riviere explains the fear of retribution as the con-sequence of a woman’s fantasy to take the place of men,more precise-ly,of the father.In the case that she herself examines,which someconsider to be autobiographical,the rivalry with the father is not over

the desire of the mother,as one might expect,but over the place of thefather in public discourse as speaker,lecturer,writer—that is,as a userof signs rather than a sign-object,an item of exchange.This castratingdesire might be understood as the desire to relinquish the status ofwoman-as-sign in order to appear as a subject within language.Indeed,the analogy that Riviere draws between the homosexualman and the masked woman is not,in her view,an analogy betweenmale and female homosexuality.Femininity is taken on by a womanwho “wishes for masculinity,”but fears the retributive consequences oftaking on the public appearance of masculinity.Masculinity is taken onby the male homosexual who,presumably,seeks to hide—not fromothers,but from himself—an ostensible femininity.The woman takeson a masquerade knowingly in order to conceal her masculinity fromthe masculine audience she wants to castrate.But the homosexual manis said to exaggerate his “heterosexuality”(meaning a masculinity thatallows him to pass as heterosexual?) as a “defense,”unknowingly,because he cannot acknowledge his own homosexuality (or is it thatthe analyst would not acknowledge it,if it were his?).In other words,the homosexual man takes unconscious retribution on himself,bothdesiring and fearing the consequences of castration.The male homo-sexual does not “know”his homosexuality,although Ferenczi andRiviere apparently do.But does Riviere know the homosexuality of the woman in mas-querade that she describes? When it comes to the counterpart of theanalogy that she herself sets up,the woman who “wishes for masculini-ty”is homosexual only in terms of sustaining a masculine identification,but not in terms of a sexual orientation or desire.Invoking Jones’stypology once again,as if it were a phallic shield,she formulates a“defense”that designates as asexual a class of female homosexuals under-stood as the masquerading type:“his first group of homosexual womenwho,while taking no interest in other women,wish for ‘recognition’oftheir masculinity from men and claim to be the equals of men,or inother words,to be men themselves”(37).As in Lacan,the lesbian is

66




here signified as an asexual position,as indeed,a position that refusessexuality.For the earlier analogy with Ferenzci to become complete,itwould seem that this description enacts the “defense”against femalehomosexuality as sexualitythat is nevertheless understood as the reflex-ive structure of the “homosexual man.”And yet,there is no clear way toread this description of a female homosexuality that is not about a sexu-al desire for women.Riviere would have us believe that this curioustypological anomaly cannot be reduced to a repressed female homosex-uality or heterosexuality.What is hidden is not sexuality,but rage.One possible interpretation is that the woman in masqueradewishes for masculinity in order to engage in public discourse with menand as a man as part of a male homoerotic exchange.And preciselybecause that male homoerotic exchange would signify castration,shefears the same retribution that motivates the “defenses”of the homo-sexual man.Indeed,perhaps femininity as masquerade is meant todeflect from male homosexuality—that being the erotic presupposi-tion of hegemonic discourse,the “hommo-sexuality”that Irigaray sug-gests.In any case,Riviere would have us consider that such womensustain masculine identifications not to occupy a position in a sexualexchange,but,rather,to pursue a rivalry that has no sexual object or,at least,that has none that she will name.Riviere’s text offers a way to reconsider the question:What ismasked by masquerade? In a key passage that marks a departure fromthe restricted analysis demarcated by Jones’s classificatory system,shesuggests that “masquerade”is more than the characteristic of an “inter-mediate type,”that it is central to all “womanliness”:The reader may now ask how I define womanliness or where I drawthe line between genuine womanliness and the ‘masquerade’.Mysuggestion is not,however,that there is any such difference;whetherradical or superficial,they are the same thing.(38)This refusal to postulate a femininity that is prior to mimicry andthe mask is taken up by Stephen Heath in “Joan Riviere and the

Prohibition,Psychoanalysis,and the Heterosexual Matrix

67




Masquerade”as evidence for the notion that “authentic womanliness issuch a mimicry,isthe masquerade.”Relying on the postulated charac-terization of libido as masculine,Heath concludes that femininity is thedenial of that libido,the “dissimulation of a fundamental masculinity.”24Femininity becomes a mask that dominates/resolves a masculineidentification,for a masculine identification would,within the pre-sumed heterosexual matrix of desire,produce a desire for a femaleobject,the Phallus;hence,the donning of femininity as mask mayreveal a refusal of a female homosexuality and,at the same time,thehyperbolic incorporation of that female Other who is refused—an oddform of preserving and protecting that love within the circle of themelancholic and negative narcissism that results from the psychicinculcation of compulsory heterosexuality.One might read Riviere as fearful of her own phallicism25—that is,of the phallic identity she risks exposing in the course of her lecture,her writing,indeed,the writing of this phallicism that the essay itselfboth conceals and enacts.It may,however,be less her own masculineidentity than the masculine heterosexual desire that is its signature thatshe seeks both to deny and enact by becoming the object she forbidsherself to love.This is the predicament produced by a matrix thataccounts for all desire for women by subjects of whatever sex or gen-der as originating in a masculine,heterosexual position.The libido-as-masculine is the source from which all possible sexuality is pre-sumed to come.26Here the typology of gender and sexuality needs to give way to adiscursive account of the cultural production of gender.If Riviere’sanalysand is a homosexual without homosexuality,that may be becausethat option is already refused her;the cultural existence of this prohi-bition is there in the lecture space,determining and differentiating heras speaker and her mainly male audience.Although she fears that hercastrating wish might be understood,she denies that there is a contestover a common object of desire without which the masculine identifi-cation that she does acknowledge would lack its confirmation and

essential sign.Indeed,her account presupposes the primacy of aggres-sion over sexuality,the desire to castrate and take the place of the mas-culine subject,a desire avowedly rooted in a rivalry,but one which,forher,exhausts itself in the act of displacement.But the question mightusefully be asked:What sexual fantasy does this aggression serve,andwhat sexuality does it authorize? Although the right to occupy theposition of a language user is the ostensible purpose of the analysand’saggression,we can ask whether there is not a repudiation of the femi-nine that prepares this position within speech and which,invariably,reemerges as the Phallic-Other that will phantasmatically confirm theauthority of the speaking subject?We might then rethink the very notions of masculinity and femi-ninity constructed here as rooted in unresolved homosexual cathexes.The melancholy refusal/domination of homosexuality culminates inthe incorporation of the same-sexed object of desire and reemerges inthe construction of discrete sexual “natures”that require and institutetheir opposites through exclusion.To presume the primacy of bisexu-ality or the primary characterization of the libido as masculine is stillnot to account for the construction of these various “primacies.”Somepsychoanalytic accounts would argue that femininity is based in theexclusion of the masculine,where the masculine is one “part”of abisexual psychic composition.The coexistence of the binary isassumed,and then repression and exclusion intercede to craft dis-cretely gendered “identities”out of this binary,with the result thatidentity is always already inherent in a bisexual disposition that is,through repression,severed into its component parts.In a sense,thebinary restriction on culture postures as the precultural bisexualitythat sunders into heterosexual familiarity through its advent into “cul-ture.”From the start,however,the binary restriction on sexualityshows clearly that culture in no way postdates the bisexuality that itpurports to repress:It constitutes the matrix of intelligibility throughwhich primary bisexuality itself becomes thinkable.The “bisexuality”that is posited as a psychic foundation and is said to be repressed at a




later date is a discursive production that claims to be prior to all dis-course,effected through the compulsory and generative exclusionarypractices of normative heterosexuality.Lacanian discourse centers on the notion of “a divide,”a primaryor fundamental split that renders the subject internally divided andthat establishes the duality of the sexes.But why this exclusive focus onthe fall into twoness? Within Lacanian terms,it appears that division isalways the effectof the law,and not a preexisting condition on whichthe law acts.Jacqueline Rose writes that “for both sexes,sexuality willnecessarily touch on the duplicity which undermines its fundamentaldivide,”27suggesting that sexual division,effected through repression,is invariably undermined by the very ruse of identity.But is it not aprediscursive doubleness that comes to undermine the univocal pos-turing of each position within the field of sexual difference? Rosewrites compellingly that “for Lacan,as we have seen,there is no pre-discursive reality (‘How return,other than by means of a special dis-course,to a prediscursive reality?’,SXX,p.33),no place prior to thelaw which is available and can be retrieved.”As an indirect critique ofIrigaray’s efforts to mark a place for feminine writing outside the phal-lic economy,Rose then adds,“And there is no feminine outside lan-guage.”28If prohibition creates the “fundamental divide”of sexuality,and if this “divide”is shown to be duplicitous precisely because of theartificiality of its division,then there must be a division that resistsdivi-sion,a psychic doubleness or inherent bisexuality that comes to under-mine every effort of severing.To consider this psychic doubleness asthe effectof the Law is Lacan’s stated purpose,but the point of resis-tance within his theory as well.Rose is no doubt right to claim that every identification,preciselybecause it has a phantasm as its ideal,is bound to fail.Any psychoanalyt-ic theory that prescribes a developmental process that presupposes theaccomplishment of a given father-son or mother-daughter identifica-tion mistakenly conflates the Symbolic with the real and misses the crit-ical point of incommensurability that exposes “identification”and the

70




drama of “being”and “having”the Phallus as invariably phantasmatic.29And yet,what determines the domain of the phantasmatic,the rulesthat regulate the incommensurability of the Symbolic with the real? It isclearly not enough to claim that this drama holds for Western,late capi-talist household dwellers and that perhaps in some yet to be definedepoch some other Symbolic regime will govern the language of sexualontology.By instituting the Symbolic as invariably phantasmatic,the“invariably”wanders into an “inevitably,”generating a description ofsexuality in terms that promote cultural stasis as its result.The rendition of Lacan that understands the prediscursive as animpossibility promises a critique that conceptualizes the Law as pro-hibitive and generative at once.That the language of physiology or dis-position does not appear here is welcome news,but binaryrestrictions nevertheless still operate to frame and formulate sexualityand delimit in advance the forms of its resistance to the “real.”Inmarking off the very domain of what is subject to repression,exclu-sion operates prior to repression—that is,in the delimitation of theLaw and its objects of subordination.Although one can argue that forLacan repression creates the repressed through the prohibitive andpaternal law,that argument does not account for the pervasive nostal-gia for the lost fullness of jouissancein his work.Indeed,the loss couldnot be understood as loss unless the very irrecoverability of that plea-sure did not designate a past that is barred from the present throughthe prohibitive law.That we cannot know that past from the positionof the founded subject is not to say that that past does not reemergewithin that subject’s speech as fêlure,discontinuity,metonymic slip-page.As the truer noumenal reality existed for Kant,the prejuridicalpast of jouissanceis unknowable from within spoken language;thatdoes not mean,however,that this past has no reality.The very inacces-sibility of the past,indicated by metonymic slippage in contemporaryspeech,confirms that original fullness as the ultimate reality.The further question emerges:What plausibility can be given to anaccount of the Symbolic that requires a conformity to the Law that

Prohibition,Psychoanalysis,and the Heterosexual Matrix

71




proves impossible to perform and that makes no room for the flexibilityof the Law itself,its cultural reformulation in more plastic forms? Theinjunction to become sexed in the ways prescribed by the Symbolicalways leads to failure and,in some cases,to the exposure of the phan-tasmatic nature of sexual identity itself.The Symbolic’s claim to be cul-tural intelligibility in its present and hegemonic form effectivelyconsolidates the power of those phantasms as well as the various dramasof identificatory failures.The alternative is not to suggest that identifi-cation should become a viable accomplishment.But there does seem tobe a romanticization or,indeed,a religious idealization of “failure,”humility and limitation before the Law,which makes the Lacanian nar-rative ideologically suspect.The dialectic between a juridical imperativethat cannot be fulfilled and an inevitable failure “before the law”recallsthe tortured relationship between the God of the Old Testament andthose humiliated servants who offer their obedience without reward.That sexuality now embodies this religious impulse in the form of thedemand for love (considered to be an “absolute”demand) that is distinctfrom both need and desire (a kind of ecstatic transcendence thateclipses sexuality altogether) lends further credibility to the Symbolicas that which operates for human subjects as the inaccessible but all-determining deity.This structure of religious tragedy in Lacanian theory effectivelyundermines any strategy of cultural politics to configure an alternativeimaginary for the play of desires.If the Symbolic guarantees the failureof the tasks it commands,perhaps its purposes,like those of the OldTestament God,are altogether unteleological—not the accomplish-ment of some goal,but obedience and suffering to enforce the “sub-ject’s”sense of limitation “before the law.”There is,of course,thecomic side to this drama that is revealed through the disclosure of thepermanent impossibility of the realization of identity.But even thiscomedy is the inverse expression of an enslavement to the God that itclaims to be unable to overcome.Lacanian theory must be understood as a kind of “slave morality.”

How would Lacanian theory be reformulated after the appropriationof Nietzsche’s insight in On the Genealogy of Moralsthat God,the inac-cessible Symbolic,is rendered inaccessibleby a power (the will-to-power)that regularly institutes its own powerlessness?30This figuration of thepaternal law as the inevitable and unknowable authority before whichthe sexed subject is bound to fail must be read for the theologicalimpulse that motivates it as well as for the critique of theology thatpoints beyond it.The construction of the law that guarantees failure issymptomatic of a slave morality that disavows the very generativepowers it uses to construct the “Law”as a permanent impossibility.What is the power that creates this fiction that reflects inevitable sub-jection? What are the cultural stakes in keeping power within that self-negating circle,and how might that power be reclaimed from thetrappings of a prohibitive law that is that power in its dissimulation andself-subjection?iii.Freud and the Melancholia of GenderAlthough Irigaray maintains that the structure of femininity and melan-choly “cross-check”31and Kristeva identifies motherhood with melan-choly in “Motherhood According to Bellini”as well as Soleil noir:Dépression et mélancolie,32there has been little effort to understand themelancholic denial/preservation of homosexuality in the production ofgender within the heterosexual frame.Freud isolates the mechanism ofmelancholia as essential to “ego formation”and “character,”but onlyalludes to the centrality of melancholia to gender.In The Ego and the Id(1923),he elaborates on the structure of mourning as the incipientstructure of ego formation,a thesis whose traces can be found in the1917 essay “Mourning and Melancholia.”33In the experience of losinganother human being whom one has loved,Freud argues,the ego is saidto incorporate that other into the very structure of the ego,taking onattributes of the other and “sustaining”the other through magical acts ofimitation.The loss of the other whom one desires and loves is overcomethrough a specific act of identification that seeks to harbor that other

within the very structure of the self:“So by taking flight into the ego,love escapes annihilation”(178).This identification is not simplymomentary or occasional,but becomes a new structure of identity;ineffect,the other becomes part of the ego through the permanent inter-nalization of the other’s attributes.34In cases in which an ambivalentrelationship is severed through loss,that ambivalence becomes internal-ized as a self-critical or self-debasing disposition in which the role of theother is now occupied and directed by the ego itself:“The narcissisticidentification with the object then becomes a substitute for the eroticcathexis,the result of which is that in spite of the conflict with the lovedperson the love-relation need not be given up”(170).Later,Freudmakes clear that the process of internalizing and sustaining lost loves iscrucial to the formation of the ego and its “object-choice.”In The Ego and the Id,Freud refers to this process of internalizationdescribed in “Mourning and Melancholia”and remarks:we succeeded in explaining the painful disorder of melancholia bysupposing that [in those suffering from it] an object which was losthas been set up again inside the ego—that is,that an object-cathexishas been replaced by an identification.At that time,however,we didnot appreciate the full significance of this process and did not knowhow common and how typical it is.Since then we have come tounderstand that this kind of substitution has a great share in deter-mining the form taken by the ego and that it makes an essential con-tribution towards building up what is called its “character.”(18)As this chapter on “The Ego and the Super-Ego (Ego-Ideal)”proceeds,however,it is not merely “character”that is being described,but theacquisition of gender identity as well.In claiming that “it may be thatthis identification is the sole condition under which the id can give upits objects,”Freud suggests that the internalizing strategy of melancho-lia does not opposethe work of mourning,but may be the only way inwhich the ego can survive the loss of its essential emotional ties to oth-ers.Freud goes on to claim that “the character of the ego is a precipi-




tate of abandoned object-cathexes and that it contains the history ofthose object-choices”(19).This process of internalizing lost lovesbecomes pertinent to gender formation when we realize that theincest taboo,among other functions,initiates a loss of a love-object forthe ego and that this ego recuperates from this loss through the inter-nalization of the tabooed object of desire.In the case of a prohibitedheterosexual union,it is the object which is denied,but not the modal-ity of desire,so that the desire is deflected from that object onto otherobjects of the opposite sex.But in the case of a prohibited homosexualunion,it is clear that both the desire and the object require renuncia-tion and so become subject to the internalizing strategies of melancho-lia.Hence,“the young boy deals with his father by identifying himselfwith him”(21).In the first formation of the boy-father identification,Freud spec-ulates that the identification takes place without the prior objectcathexis (21),meaning that the identification is not the consequence ofa love lost or prohibited of the son for the father.Later,however,Freuddoes postulate primary bisexuality as a complicating factor in theprocess of character and gender formation.With the postulation of abisexual set of libidinal dispositions,there is no reason to deny an orig-inal sexual love of the son for the father,and yet Freud implicitly does.The boy does,however,sustain a primary cathexis for the mother,andFreud remarks that bisexuality there makes itself known in the mascu-line and feminine behavior with which the boy-child attempts toseduce the mother.Although Freud introduces the Oedipal complex to explain whythe boy must repudiate the mother and adopt an ambivalent attitudetoward the father,he remarks shortly afterward that,“It may even bethat the ambivalence displayed in the relations to the parents should beattributed entirely to bisexuality and that it is not,as I have representedabove,developed out of identification in consequence of rivalry”(23,n.1).But what would condition the ambivalence in such a case? Clearly,Freud means to suggest that the boy must choose not only between the

two object choices,but the two sexual dispositions,masculine and fem-inine.That the boy usually chooses the heterosexual would,then,be theresult,not of the fear of castration by the father,but of the fear of cas-tration—that is,the fear of “feminization”associated within heterosex-ual cultures with male homosexuality.In effect,it is not primarily theheterosexual lust for the mother that must be punished and sublimated,but the homosexual cathexis that must be subordinated to a culturallysanctioned heterosexuality.Indeed,if it is primary bisexuality ratherthan the Oedipal drama of rivalry which produces the boy’s repudiationof femininity and his ambivalence toward his father,then the primacy ofthe maternal cathexis becomes increasingly suspect and,consequently,the primary heterosexuality of the boy’s object cathexis.Regardless of the reason for the boy’s repudiation of the mother (do we construe the punishing father as a rival or as an object of desirewho forbids himself as such?),the repudiation becomes the foundingmoment of what Freud calls gender “consolidation.”Forfeiting themother as object of desire,the boy either internalizes the loss throughidentification with her,or displaces his heterosexual attachment,inwhich case he fortifies his attachment to his father and thereby “consoli-dates”his masculinity.As the metaphor of consolidation suggests,thereare clearly bits and pieces of masculinity to be found within the psychiclandscape,dispositions,sexual trends,and aims,but they are diffuse anddisorganized,unbounded by the exclusivity of a heterosexual objectchoice.Indeed,if the boy renounces both aim and object and,there-fore,heterosexual cathexis altogether,he internalizes the mother andsets up a feminine superego which dissolves and disorganizes masculini-ty,consolidating feminine libidinal dispositions in its place.For the young girl as well,the Oedipal complex can be either “pos-itive”(same-sex identification) or “negative”(opposite-sex identifica-tion);the loss of the father initiated by the incest taboo may resulteither in an identification with the object lost (a consolidation of mas-culinity) or a deflection of the aim from the object,in which case het-erosexuality triumphs over homosexuality,and a substitute object is

found.At the close of his brief paragraph on the negative Oedipal com-plex in the young girl,Freud remarks that the factor that decideswhich identification is accomplished is the strength or weakness ofmasculinity and femininity in her disposition.Significantly,Freudavows his confusion about what precisely a masculine or feminine dis-position is when he interrupts his statement midway with the hyphen-ated doubt:“—whatever that may consist in—”(22).What are these primary dispositions on which Freud himself appar-ently founders? Are these attributes of an unconscious libidinal organi-zation,and how precisely do the various identifications set up inconsequence of the Oedipal conflict work to reinforce or dissolve eachof these dispositions? What aspect of “femininity”do we call disposition-al,and which is the consequence of identification? Indeed,what is tokeep us from understanding the “dispositions”of bisexuality as the effectsor productionsof a series of internalizations? Moreover,how do we iden-tify a “feminine”or a “masculine”disposition at the outset? By whattraces is it known,and to what extent do we assume a “feminine”or a“masculine”disposition as the precondition of a heterosexual objectchoice? In other words,to what extent do we read the desire for thefather as evidence of a feminine disposition only because we begin,despite the postulation of primary bisexuality,with a heterosexualmatrix for desire?The conceptualization of bisexuality in terms of dispositions,feminineand masculine,which have heterosexual aims as their intentional corre-lates,suggests that for Freud bisexuality is the coincidence of two heterosexu-al desires within a single psyche.The masculine disposition is,in effect,never oriented toward the father as an object of sexual love,and neitheris the feminine disposition oriented toward the mother (the young girlmay be so oriented,but this is before she has renounced that “mascu-line”side of her dispositional nature).In repudiating the mother as anobject of sexual love,the girl of necessity repudiates her masculinityand,paradoxically,“fixes”her femininity as a consequence.Hence,

within Freud’s thesis of primary bisexuality,there is no homosexuality,and only opposites attract.But what is the proof Freud gives us for the existence of suchdispositions? If there is no way to distinguish between the femininityacquired through internalizations and that which is strictly dispositional,then what is to preclude the conclusion that all gender-specific affinitiesare the consequence of internalizations? On what basis are dispositionalsexualities and identities ascribed to individuals,and what meaning canwe give to “femininity”and “masculinity”at the outset? Taking the prob-lematic of internalization as a point of departure,let us consider the sta-tus of internalized identifications in the formation of gender and,secondarily,the relation between an internalized gender affinity and theself-punishing melancholia of internalized identifications.In “Mourning and Melancholia,”Freud interprets the self-criticalattitudes of the melancholic to be the result of the internalization of alost object of love.Precisely because that object is lost,even thoughthe relationship remains ambivalent and unresolved,the object is“brought inside”the ego where the quarrel magically resumes as aninterior dialogue between two parts of the psyche.In “Mourning andMelancholia,”the lost object is set up within the ego as a critical voiceor agency,and the anger originally felt for the object is reversed so thatthe internalized object now berates the ego:If one listens patiently to the many and various self-accusations of themelancholic,one cannot in the end avoid the impression that oftenthe most violent of them are hardly applicable to the patient himself,but that with insignificant modifications they do fit someone else,some person whom the patient loves,has loved or ought to love....the self-reproaches are reproaches against a loved object which havebeen shifted onto the patient’s own ego.(169)The melancholic refuses the loss of the object,and internalizationbecomes a strategy of magically resuscitating the lost object,not only

because the loss is painful,but because the ambivalence felt toward theobject requires that the object be retained until differences are settled.In this early essay,Freud understands grief to be the withdrawal oflibidinal cathexis from the object and the successful transferral of thatcathexis onto a fresh object.In The Ego and the Id,however,Freud revis-es this distinction between mourning and melancholia and suggests thatthe identification process associated with melancholia may be “the solecondition under which the id can give up its objects”(19).In otherwords,the identification with lost loves characteristic of melancholiabecomes the precondition for the work of mourning.The two process-es,originally conceived as oppositional,are now understood as inte-grally related aspects of the grieving process.35In his later view,Freudremarks that the internalization of loss is compensatory:“When the egoassumes the features of the object,it is forcing itself,so to speak,uponthe id’s loss by saying:‘Look,you can love me too—I am so like theobject’”(20).Strictly speaking,the giving up of the object is not a nega-tion of the cathexis,but its internalization and,hence,preservation.What precisely is the topology of the psyche in which the ego andits lost loves reside in perpetual habitation? Clearly,Freud conceptual-izes the ego in the perpetual company of the ego ideal which acts as amoral agency of various kinds.The internalized losses of the ego arereestablished as part of this agency of moral scrutiny,the internaliza-tion of anger and blame originally felt for the object in its externalmode.In the act of internalization,that anger and blame,inevitablyheightened by the loss itself,are turned inward and sustained;the egochanges place with the internalized object,thereby investing this inter-nalized externality with moral agency and power.Thus,the ego forfeitsits anger and efficacy to the ego ideal which turns against the very egoby which it is sustained;in other words,the ego constructs a way toturn against itself.Indeed,Freud warns of the hypermoral possibilitiesof this ego ideal,which,taken to its extreme,can motivate suicide.36The construction of the interior ego ideal involves the internali-

zation of gender identities as well.Freud remarks that the ego ideal is a solution to the Oedipal complex and is thus instrumental in thesuccessful consolidation of masculinity and femininity:The super-ego is,however,not simply a residue of the earliestobject-choices of the id:it also represents an energetic reaction-for-mation against these choices.Its relation to the ego is not exhaustedby the precept:“You ought to be like this (like your father.)”It alsocomprises the prohibition:“You may not belike this (like yourfather)—that is,you may not do all that he does;some things are hisprerogative.”(24)The ego ideal thus serves as an interior agency of sanction andtaboo which,according to Freud,works to consolidate gender identitythrough the appropriate rechanneling and sublimation of desire.Theinternalization of the parent as object of love suffers a necessary inver-sion of meaning.The parent is not only prohibited as an object of love,but is internalized as a prohibitingor withholding object of love.Theprohibitive function of the ego ideal thus works to inhibit or,indeed,repress the expression of desire for that parent,but also founds aninterior “space”in which that love can be preserved.Because the solutionto the Oedipal dilemma can be either “positive”or “negative,”the pro-hibition of the opposite-sexed parent can either lead to an identifica-tion with the sex of the parent lost or a refusal of that identificationand,consequently,a deflection of heterosexual desire.As a set of sanctions and taboos,the ego ideal regulates and deter-mines masculine and feminine identification.Because identificationssubstitute for object relations,and identifications are the consequenceof loss,gender identification is a kind of melancholia in which the sexof the prohibited object is internalized as a prohibition.This prohibi-tion sanctions and regulates discrete gendered identity and the law ofheterosexual desire.The resolution of the Oedipal complex affectsgender identification through not only the incest taboo,but,prior tothat,the taboo against homosexuality.The result is that one identifies

with the same-sexed object of love,thereby internalizing both the aimand object of the homosexual cathexis.The identifications consequentto melancholia are modes of preserving unresolved object relations,and in the case of same-sexed gender identification,the unresolvedobject relations are invariably homosexual.Indeed,the stricter andmore stable the gender affinity,the less resolved the original loss,sothat rigid gender boundaries inevitably work to conceal the loss of anoriginal love that,unacknowledged,fails to be resolved.But clearly not all gender identification is based on the successfulimplementation of the taboo against homosexuality.If feminine andmasculine dispositions are the result of the effective internalization ofthat taboo,and if the melancholic answer to the loss of the same-sexedobject is to incorporate and,indeed,to becomethat object through theconstruction of the ego ideal,then gender identity appears primarilyto be the internalization of a prohibition that proves to be formative ofidentity.Further,this identity is constructed and maintained by theconsistent application of this taboo,not only in the stylization of thebody in compliance with discrete categories of sex,but in the produc-tion and “disposition”of sexual desire.The language of dispositionmoves from a verb formation (to be disposed) into a noun formation,whereupon it becomes congealed (to have dispositions);the language of“dispositions”thus arrives as a false foundationalism,the results ofaffectivity being formed or “fixed”through the effects of the prohibi-tion.As a consequence,dispositions are not the primary sexual facts ofthe psyche,but produced effects of a law imposed by culture and bythe complicitous and transvaluating acts of the ego ideal.In melancholia,the loved object is lost through a variety of means:separation,death,or the breaking of an emotional tie.In the Oedipalsituation,however,the loss is dictated by a prohibitionattended by a setof punishments.The melancholia of gender identification which“answers”the Oedipal dilemma must be understood,then,as the inter-nalization of an interior moral directive which gains its structure andenergy from an externally enforced taboo.Although Freud does not

explicitly argue in its favor,it would appear that the taboo againsthomosexuality must precedethe heterosexual incest taboo;the tabooagainst homosexuality in effect creates the heterosexual “dispositions”by which the Oedipal conflict becomes possible.The young boy andyoung girl who enter into the Oedipal drama with incestuous hetero-sexual aims have already been subjected to prohibitions which “dis-pose”them in distinct sexual directions.Hence,the dispositions thatFreud assumes to be primary or constitutive facts of sexual life areeffects of a law which,internalized,produces and regulates discretegender identity and heterosexuality.Far from foundational,these dispositions are the result of a processwhose aim is to disguise its own genealogy.In other words,“disposi-tions”are traces of a history of enforced sexual prohibitions which isuntold and which the prohibitions seek to render untellable.The nar-rative account of gender acquisition that begins with the postulation ofdispositions effectively forecloses the narrative point of departurewhich would expose the narrative as a self-amplifying tactic of the pro-hibition itself.In the psychoanalytic narrative,the dispositions aretrained,fixed,and consolidated by a prohibition which later and in thename of culture arrives to quell the disturbance created by an unre-strained homosexual cathexis.Told from the point of view which takesthe prohibitive law to be the founding moment of the narrative,thelaw both produces sexuality in the form of “dispositions”and appearsdisingenuously at a later point in time to transform these ostensibly“natural”dispositions into culturally acceptable structures of exogamickinship.In order to conceal the genealogy of the law as productive ofthe very phenomenon it later claims only to channel or repress,thelaw performs a third function:Instating itself as the principle of logicalcontinuity in a narrative of causal relations which takes psychic facts asits point of departure,this configuration of the law forecloses the pos-sibility of a more radical genealogy into the cultural origins of sexuali-ty and power relations.What precisely does it mean to reverse Freud’s causal narrative and

to think of primary dispositions as effects of the law? In the first volumeof The History of Sexuality,Foucault criticizes the repressive hypothesisfor the presumption of an original desire (not “desire”in Lacan’s terms,but jouissance) that maintains ontological integrity and temporal priori-ty with respect to the repressive law.37This law,according to Foucault,subsequently silences or transmutes that desire into a secondary andinevitably dissatisfying form or expression (displacement).Foucaultargues that the desire which is conceived as both original and repressedis the effect of the subjugating law itself.In consequence,the law pro-duces the conceit of the repressed desire in order to rationalize its ownself-amplifying strategies,and,rather than exercise a repressive func-tion,the juridical law,here as elsewhere,ought to be reconceived as adiscursive practice which is productive or generative—discursive inthat it produces the linguistic fiction of repressed desire in order tomaintain its own position as a teleological instrument.The desire inquestion takes on the meaning of “repressed”to the extent that the lawconstitutes its contextualizing frame;indeed,the law identifies andinvigorates “repressed desire”as such,circulates the term,and,ineffect,carves out the discursive space for the self-conscious and linguis-tically elaborated experience called “repressed desire.”The taboo against incest and,implicitly,against homosexuality is arepressive injunction which presumes an original desire localized inthe notion of “dispositions,”which suffers a repression of an originallyhomosexual libidinal directionality and produces the displaced phe-nomenon of heterosexual desire.The structure of this particular meta-narrative of infantile development figures sexual dispositions as theprediscursive,temporally primary,and ontologically discrete driveswhich have a purpose and,hence,a meaning prior to their emergenceinto language and culture.The very entry into the cultural fielddeflects that desire from its original meaning,with the consequencethat desire within culture is,of necessity,a series of displacements.Thus,the repressive law effectively produces heterosexuality,and actsnot merely as a negative or exclusionary code,but as a sanction and,

most pertinently,as a law of discourse,distinguishing the speakablefrom the unspeakable (delimiting and constructing the domain of theunspeakable),the legitimate from the illegitimate.iv.Gender Complexity and the Limits of IdentificationThe foregoing analyses of Lacan,Riviere,and Freud’s The Ego and the Idoffer competing versions of how gender identifications work—indeed,of whether they can be said to “work”at all.Can gender complexityand dissonance be accounted for by the multiplication and conver-gence of a variety of culturally dissonant identifications? Or is all iden-tification constructed through the exclusion of a sexuality that putsthose identifications into question? In the first instance,multiple iden-tifications can constitute a nonhierarchical configuration of shiftingand overlapping identifications that call into question the primacy ofany univocal gender attribution.In the Lacanian framework,identifica-tion is understood to be fixed within the binary disjunction of “having”or “being”the Phallus,with the consequence that the excluded term ofthe binary continually haunts and disrupts the coherent posturing ofany one.The excluded term is an excluded sexuality that contests theself-grounding pretensions of the subject as well as its claims to knowthe source and object of its desire.For the most part,feminist critics concerned with the psychoana-lytic problematic of identification have often focused on the questionof a maternal identification and sought to elaborate a feminist episte-mological position from that maternal identification and/or a mater-nal discourse evolved from the point of view of that identification andits difficulties.Although much of that work is extremely significant andclearly influential,it has come to occupy a hegemonic position withinthe emerging canon of feminist theory.Further,it tends to reinforceprecisely the binary,heterosexist framework that carves up gendersinto masculine and feminine and forecloses an adequate description ofthe kinds of subversive and parodic convergences that characterize gay

and lesbian cultures.As a very partial effort to come to terms with thatmaternalist discourse,however,Julia Kristeva’s description of thesemiotic as a maternal subversion of the Symbolic will be examined inthe following chapter.What critical strategies and sources of subversion appear as theconsequence of the psychoanalytic accounts considered so far? Therecourse to the unconscious as a source of subversion makes sense,itseems,only if the paternal law is understood as a rigid and universaldeterminism which makes of “identity”a fixed and phantasmatic affair.Even if we accept the phantasmatic content of identity,there is no rea-son to assume that the law which fixes the terms of that fantasy isimpervious to historical variability and possibility.As opposed to the founding Law of the Symbolic that fixes identityin advance,we might reconsider the history of constitutive identifica-tions without the presupposition of a fixed and founding Law.Althoughthe “universality”of the paternal law may be contested within anthropo-logical circles,it seems important to consider that the meaningthat thelaw sustains in any given historical context is less univocal and lessdeterministically efficacious than the Lacanian account appears toacknowledge.It should be possible to offer a schematic of the ways inwhich a constellation of identifications conforms or fails to conform toculturally imposed standards of gender integrity.The constitutive iden-tifications of an autobiographical narrative are always partially fabricat-ed in the telling.Lacan claims that we can never tell the story of ourorigins,precisely because language bars the speaking subject from therepressed libidinal origins of its speech;however,the foundationalmoment in which the paternal law institutes the subject seems to func-tion as a metahistory which we not only can but ought to tell,eventhough the founding moments of the subject,the institution of the law,is as equally prior to the speaking subject as the unconscious itself.The alternative perspective on identification that emerges frompsychoanalytic theory suggests that multiple and coexisting identifica-tions produce conflicts,convergences,and innovative dissonances

Prohibition,Psychoanalysis,and the Heterosexual Matrix

85




within gender configurations which contest the fixity of masculine andfeminine placements with respect to the paternal law.In effect,thepossibility of multiple identifications (which are not finally reducibleto primary or founding identifications that are fixed within masculineand feminine positions) suggests that the Law is not deterministic andthat “the”law may not even be singular.The debate over the meaning or subversive possibilities of identifi-cations so far has left unclear exactly where those identifications are tobe found.The interior psychic space in which identifications are said tobe preserved makes sense only if we can understand that interior spaceas a phantasized locale that serves yet another psychic function.Inagreement with Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok it seems,psychoan-alyst Roy Schafer argues that “incorporation”is a fantasy and not aprocess;the interior space into which an object is taken is imagined,and imagined within a language that can conjure and reify suchspaces.38If the identifications sustained through melancholy are“incorporated,”then the question remains:Where is this incorporatedspace? If it is not literally within the body,perhaps it is onthe body asits surface signification such that the body must itself be understood asan incorporated space.Abraham and Torok have argued that introjection is a process thatserves the work of mourning (where the object is not only lost,butacknowledged as lost).39Incorporation,on the other hand,belongsmore properly to melancholy,the state of disavowed or suspendedgrief in which the object is magically sustained “in the body”in someway.Abraham and Torok suggest that introjection of the loss character-istic of mourning establishes an empty space,literalized by the emptymouth which becomes the condition of speech and signification.Thesuccessful displacement of the libido from the lost object is achievedthrough the formation of wordswhich both signify and displace thatobject;this displacement from the original object is an essentiallymetaphorical activity in which words “figure”the absence and surpassit.Introjection is understood to be the work of mourning,but incor-

poration,which denotes a magicalresolution of loss,characterizesmelancholy.Whereas introjection founds the possibility of metaphori-cal signification,incorporation is antimetaphorical precisely because itmaintains the loss as radically unnameable;in other words,incorpora-tion is not only a failure to name or avow the loss,but erodes the con-ditions of metaphorical signification itself.As in the Lacanian perspective,for Abraham and Torok the repudia-tion of the maternal body is the condition of signification within theSymbolic.They argue further that this primary repression founds thepossibility of individuation and of significant speech,where speech isnecessarily metaphorical,in the sense that the referent,the object ofdesire,is a perpetual displacement.In effect,the loss of the maternalbody as an object of love is understood to establish the empty space outof which words originate.But the refusal of this loss—melancholy—results in the failure to displace into words;indeed,the place of thematernal body is established in the body,“encrypted,”to use their term,and given permanent residence there as a dead and deadening part ofthe body or one inhabited or possessed by phantasms of various kinds.When we consider gender identity as a melancholic structure,itmakes sense to choose “incorporation”as the manner by which thatidentification is accomplished.Indeed,according to the scheme above,gender identity would be established through a refusal of loss thatencrypts itself in the body and that determines,in effect,the livingversus the dead body.As an antimetaphorical activity,incorporationliteralizesthe loss onor inthe body and so appears as the facticity of thebody,the means by which the body comes to bear “sex”as its literaltruth.The localization and/or prohibition of pleasures and desires ingiven “erotogenic”zones is precisely the kind of gender-differentiatingmelancholy that suffuses the body’s surface.The loss of the pleasurableobject is resolved through the incorporation of that very pleasure withthe result that pleasure is both determined and prohibited through thecompulsory effects of the gender-differentiating law.The incest taboo is,of course,more inclusive than the taboo against

homosexuality,but in the case of the heterosexual incest taboo throughwhich heterosexual identity is established,the loss is borne as grief.Inthe case of the prohibition against homosexual incest through whichheterosexual identity is established,however,the loss is sustainedthrough a melancholic structure.The loss of the heterosexual object,argues Freud,results in the displacement of that object,but not the het-erosexual aim;on the other hand,the loss of the homosexual objectrequires the loss of the aim andthe object.In other words,the object isnot only lost,but the desire fully denied,such that “I never lost that per-son and I never loved that person,indeed never felt that kind of love atall.”The melancholic preservation of that love is all the more securelysafeguarded through the totalizing trajectory of the denial.Irigaray’s argument that in Freud’s work the structures of mel-ancholy and of developed femininity are very similar refers to thedenial of both object and aim that constitutes the “double wave”ofrepression characteristic of a fully developed femininity.For Irigaray,itis the recognition of castration that initiates the young girl into “a ‘loss’that radically escapes any representation.”40Melancholia is thus apsychoanalytic norm for women,one that rests upon her ostensibledesire to have the penis,a desire which,conveniently,can no longer befelt or known.Irigaray’s reading,full of mocking citations,is right to debunk thedevelopmental claims regarding sexuality and femininity that clearlypervade Freud’s text.As she also shows,there are possible readings ofthat theory that exceed,invert,and displace Freud’s stated aims.Consider that the refusal of the homosexual cathexis,desire and aimtogether,a refusal both compelled by social taboo and appropriatedthrough developmental stages,results in a melancholic structurewhich effectively encloses that aim and object within the corporealspace or “crypt”established through an abiding denial.If the heterosex-ual denial of homosexuality results in melancholia and if melancholiaoperates through incorporation,then the disavowed homosexual loveis preserved through the cultivation of an oppositionally defined gen-




der identity.In other words,disavowed male homosexuality culmi-nates in a heightened or consolidated masculinity,one which maintainsthe feminine as the unthinkable and unnameable.The acknowledgmentof heterosexual desire,however,leads to a displacement from an origi-nal to a secondary object,precisely the kind of libidinal detachmentand reattachment that Freud affirms as the character of normal grief.Clearly,a homosexual for whom heterosexual desire is unthinkablemay well maintain that heterosexuality through a melancholic structureof incorporation,an identification and embodiment of the love that isneither acknowledged nor grieved.But here it becomes clear that theheterosexual refusal to acknowledge the primary homosexual attach-ment is culturally enforced by a prohibition on homosexuality which isin no way paralleled in the case of the melancholic homosexual.Inother words,heterosexual melancholy is culturally instituted and main-tained as the price of stable gender identities related through opposi-tional desires.But what language of surface and depth adequately expresses thisincorporating effect of melancholy? A preliminary answer to this ques-tion is possible within the psychoanalytic discourse,but a fuller under-standing will lead in the last chapter to a consideration of gender as anenactment that performatively constitutes the appearance of its owninterior fixity.At this point,however,the contention that incorporationis a fantasy suggests that the incorporation of an identification is a fanta-sy of literalization or a literalizing fantasy.41Precisely by virtue of itsmelancholic structure,this literalization of the body conceals its geneal-ogy and offers itself under the category of “natural fact.”What does it mean to sustain a literalizing fantasy? If gender differ-entiation follows upon the incest taboo and the prior taboo on homo-sexuality,then “becoming”a gender is a laborious process of becomingnaturalized,which requires a differentiation of bodily pleasures andparts on the basis of gendered meanings.Pleasures are said to reside inthe penis,the vagina,and the breasts or to emanate from them,but suchdescriptions correspond to a body which has already been constructed

Prohibition,Psychoanalysis,and the Heterosexual Matrix

89




or naturalized as gender-specific.In other words,some parts of thebody become conceivable foci of pleasure precisely because they corre-spond to a normative ideal of a gender-specific body.Pleasures are insome sense determined by the melancholic structure of gender where-by some organs are deadened to pleasure,and others brought to life.Which pleasures shall live and which shall die is often a matter of whichserve the legitimating practices of identity formation that take placewithin the matrix of gender norms.42Transsexuals often claim a radical discontinuity between sexualpleasures and bodily parts.Very often what is wanted in terms of plea-sure requires an imaginary participation in body parts,either ap-pendages or orifices,that one might not actually possess,or,similarly,pleasure may require imagining an exaggerated or diminished set ofparts.The imaginary status of desire,of course,is not restricted to thetranssexual identity;the phantasmatic nature of desire reveals the bodynot as its ground or cause,but as its occasionand its object.The strategyof desire is in part the transfiguration of the desiring body itself.Indeed,in order to desire at all it may be necessary to believe in analtered bodily ego43which,within the gendered rules of the imaginary,might fit the requirements of a body capable of desire.This imaginarycondition of desire always exceeds the physical body through or onwhich it works.Always already a cultural sign,the body sets limits to the imagi-nary meanings that it occasions,but is never free of an imaginary con-struction.The fantasized body can never be understood in relation tothe body as real;it can only be understood in relation to another cul-turally instituted fantasy,one which claims the place of the “literal”andthe “real.”The limits to the “real”are produced within the naturalizedheterosexualization of bodies in which physical facts serve as causesand desires reflect the inexorable effects of that physicality.The conflation of desire with the real—that is,the belief that it isparts of the body,the “literal”penis,the “literal”vagina,which causepleasure and desire—is precisely the kind of literalizing fantasy char-

acteristic of the syndrome of melancholic heterosexuality.The dis-avowed homosexuality at the base of melancholic heterosexualityreemerges as the self-evident anatomical facticity of sex,where “sex”designates the blurred unity of anatomy,“natural identity,”and “naturaldesire.”The loss is denied and incorporated,and the genealogy of thattransmutation fully forgotten and repressed.The sexed surface of thebody thus emerges as the necessary sign of a natural(ized) identity anddesire.The loss of homosexuality is refused and the love sustained orencrypted in the parts of the body itself,literalized in the ostensibleanatomical facticity of sex.Here we see the general strategy of literal-ization as a form of forgetfulness,which,in the case of a literalizedsexual anatomy,“forgets”the imaginary and,with it,an imaginablehomosexuality.In the case of the melancholic heterosexual male,henever loved another man,he isa man,and he can seek recourse to theempirical facts that will prove it.But the literalization of anatomy notonly proves nothing,but is a literalizing restriction of pleasure in thevery organ that is championed as the sign of masculine identity.Thelove for the father is stored in the penis,safeguarded through animpervious denial,and the desire which now centers on that penis hasthat continual denial as its structure and its task.Indeed,the woman-as-object must be the sign that he not only never felt homosexualdesire,but never felt the grief over its loss.Indeed,the woman-as-signmust effectively displace and conceal that preheterosexual history infavor of one that consecrates a seamless heterosexuality.v.Reformulating Prohibition as PowerAlthough Foucault’s genealogical critique of foundationalism hasguided this reading of Lévi-Strauss,Freud,and the heterosexualmatrix,an even more precise understanding is needed of how thejuridical law of psychoanalysis,repression,produces and proliferatesthe genders it seeks to control.Feminist theorists have been drawn tothe psychoanalytic account of sexual difference in part because theOedipal and pre-Oedipal dynamics appear to offer a way to trace the

primary construction of gender.Can the prohibition against incest thatproscribes and sanctions hierarchial and binary gendered positions bereconceived as a productive power that inadvertently generates severalcultural configurations of gender? Is the incest taboo subject to the cri-tique of the repressive hypothesis that Foucault provides? What woulda feminist deployment of that critique look like? Would such a critiquemobilize the project to confound the binary restrictions on sex/gen-der imposed by the heterosexual matrix? Clearly,one of the mostinfluential feminist readings of Lévi-Strauss,Lacan,and Freud is GayleRubin’s “The Traffic of Women:The ‘Political Economy’of Sex,”pub-lished in 1975.44Although Foucault does not appear in that article,Rubin effectively sets the stage for a Foucaultian critique.That she her-self later appropriates Foucault for her own work in radical sexual the-ory45retrospectively raises the question of how that influential articlemight be rewritten within a Foucaultian frame.Foucault’s analysis of the culturally productive possibilities of theprohibitive law clearly takes its bearing within the existing theory onsublimation articulated by Freud in Civilization and its Discontents andreinterpreted by Marcuse in Eros and Civilization.Both Freud andMarcuse identify the productive effects of sublimation,arguing that cul-tural artifacts and institutions are the effects of sublimated Eros.Although Freud saw the sublimation of sexuality as producing a general“discontent,”Marcuse subordinates Eros to Logos in Platonic fashionand saw in the act of sublimation the most satisfying expression of thehuman spirit.In a radical departure from these theories of sublimation,however,Foucault argues on behalf of a productive law without the pos-tulation of an original desire;the operation of this law is justified andconsolidated through the construction of a narrative account of its owngenealogy which effectively masks its own immersion in power rela-tions.The incest taboo,then,would repress no primary dispositions,but effectively create the distinction between “primary”and “secondary”dispositions to describe and reproduce the distinction between a legiti-mate heterosexuality and an illegitimate homosexuality.Indeed,if we

conceive of the incest taboo as primarily productive in its effects,thenthe prohibition that founds the “subject”and survives as the law of itsdesire becomes the means by which identity,particularly gender identi-ty,is constituted.Underscoring the incest taboo as both a prohibition and a sanc-tion,Rubin writes:the incest taboo imposes the social aim of exogamy and alliance uponthe biological events of sex and procreation.The incest taboo dividesthe universe of sexual choice into categories of permitted and pro-hibited sexual partners.(173)Because all cultures seek to reproduce themselves,and because theparticular social identity of the kinship group must be preserved,exogamy is instituted and,as its presupposition,so is exogamic hetero-sexuality.Hence,the incest taboo not only forbids sexual unionbetween members of the same kinship line,but involves a tabooagainst homosexuality as well.Rubin writes:the incest taboo presupposes a prior,less articulate taboo on homo-sexuality.A prohibition against someheterosexual unions assumes ataboo against nonheterosexual unions.Gender is not only an identifi-cation with one sex;it also entails that sexual desire be directedtoward the other sex.The sexual division of labor is implicated inboth aspects of gender—male and female it creates them,and it cre-ates them heterosexual.(180)Rubin understands psychoanalysis,especially in its Lacanian incar-nation,to complement Lévi-Strauss’s description of kinship relations.In particular,she understands that the “sex/gender system,”the regu-lated cultural mechanism of transforming biological males and femalesinto discrete and hierarchized genders,is at once mandated by culturalinstitutions (the family,the residual forms of “the exchange ofwomen,”obligatory heterosexuality) and inculcated through the lawswhich structure and propel individual psychic development.Hence,

the Oedipal complex instantiates and executes the cultural tabooagainst incest and results in discrete gender identification and a corol-lary heterosexual disposition.In this essay,Rubin further maintainsthat before the transformation of a biological male or female into agendered man or woman,“each child contains all of the sexual possi-bilities available to human expression”(189).The effort to locate and describe a sexuality “before the law”as aprimary bisexuality or as an ideal and unconstrained polymorphous-ness implies that the law is antecedent to sexuality.As a restriction ofan originary fullness,the law prohibits some set of prepunitive sexualpossibilities and the sanctioning of others.But if we apply theFoucaultian critique of the repressive hypothesis to the incest taboo,that paradigmatic law of repression,then it would appear that the lawproduces bothsanctioned heterosexuality and transgressive homosexu-ality.Both are indeed effects,temporally and ontologically later thanthe law itself,and the illusion of a sexuality before the law is itself thecreation of that law.Rubin’s essay remains committed to a distinction between sex andgender which assumes the discrete and prior ontological reality of a“sex”which is done over in the name of the law,that is,transformedsubsequently into “gender.”This narrative of gender acquisition requiresa certain temporal ordering of events which assumes that the narrator isin some position to “know”both what is before and after the law.Andyet the narration takes place within a language which,strictly speaking,is after the law,the consequence of the law,and so proceeds from abelated and retrospective point of view.If this language is structured bythe law,and the law is exemplified,indeed,enacted in the language,then the description,the narration,not only cannot know what is out-side itself—that is,prior to the law—but its description of that “before”will always be in the service of the “after.”In other words,not only doesthe narration claim access to a “before”from which it is definitionally(by virtue of its linguisticality) precluded,but the description of the

“before”takes place within the terms of the “after”and,hence,becomesan attenuation of the law itself into the site of its absence.Although Rubin claims that the unlimited universe of sexual possi-bilities exists for the pre-Oedipal child,she does not subscribe to aprimary bisexuality.Indeed,bisexuality is the consequence of child-rearing practices in which parents of both sexes are present andpresently occupied with child care and in which the repudiation offemininity no longer serves as a precondition of gender identity forboth men and women (199).When Rubin calls for a “revolution in kin-ship,”she envisions the eradication of the exchange of women,thetraces of which are evident not only in the contemporary institutional-ization of heterosexuality,but in the residual psychic norms (the insti-tutionalization of the psyche) which sanction and construct sexualityand gender identity in heterosexual terms.With the loosening of thecompulsory character of heterosexuality and the simultaneous emer-gence of bisexual and homosexual cultural possibilities for behaviorand identity,Rubin envisions the overthrow of gender itself (204).Inasmuch as gender is the cultural transformation of a biological poly-sexuality into a culturally mandated heterosexuality and inasmuch asthat heterosexuality deploys discrete and hierarchized gender identitiesto accomplish its aim,then the breakdown of the compulsory characterof heterosexuality would imply,for Rubin,the corollary breakdown ofgender itself.Whether or not gender can be fully eradicated and inwhat sense its “breakdown”is culturally imaginable remain intriguingbut unclarified implications of her analysis.Rubin’s argument rests on the possibility that the law can be effec-tively overthrown and that the cultural interpretation of differentlysexed bodies can proceed,ideally,without reference to gender dispar-ity.That systems of compulsory heterosexuality may alter,and indeedhave changed,and that the exchange of women,in whatever residualform,need not always determine heterosexual exchange,seems clear;in this sense,Rubin recognizes the misogynist implications of Lévi-

Strauss’s notoriously nondiachronic structuralism.But what leads her to the conclusion that gender is merely a function of compulsoryheterosexuality and that without that compulsory status,the field ofbodies would no longer be marked in gendered terms? Clearly,Rubinhas already envisioned an alternative sexual world,one which is attrib-uted to a utopian stage in infantile development,a “before”the lawwhich promises to reemerge “after”the demise or dispersal of that law.If we accept the Foucaultian and Derridean criticisms of the viability ofknowing or referring to such a “before,”how would we revise this nar-rative of gender acquisition? If we reject the postulation of an idealsexuality prior to the incest taboo,and if we also refuse to accept thestructuralist premise of the cultural permanence of that taboo,whatrelation between sexuality and the law remains for the description ofgender? Do we need recourse to a happier state before the law in orderto maintain that contemporary gender relations and the punitive pro-duction of gender identities are oppressive?Foucault’s critique of the repressive-hypothesis in The History ofSexuality,Volume Iargues that (a) the structuralist “law”might be under-stood as one formation of power,a specific historical configuration andthat (b) the law might be understood to produce or generate the desireit is said to repress.The object of repression is not the desireit takes to beits ostensible object,but the multiple configurations of power itself,thevery plurality of which would displace the seeming universality andnecessity of the juridical or repressive law.In other words,desire and itsrepression are an occasion for the consolidation of juridical structures;desire is manufactured and forbidden as a ritual symbolic gesturewhereby the juridical model exercises and consolidates its own power.The incest taboo is the juridical law that is said both to prohibitincestuous desires and to construct certain gendered subjectivitiesthrough the mechanism of compulsory identification.But what is toguarantee the universality or necessity of this law? Clearly,there areanthropological debates that seek to affirm and to dispute the univer-sality of the incest taboo,46and there is a second-order dispute over

what,if anything,the claim to universality might imply about themeaning of social processes.47To claim that a law is universal is not toclaim that it operates in the same way crossculturally or that it deter-mines social life in some unilateral way.Indeed,the attribution of uni-versality to a law may simply imply that it operates as a dominantframework within which social relations take place.Indeed,to claimthe universal presence of a law in social life is in no way to claim that itexists in every aspect of the social form under consideration;minimal-ly,it means that it exists and operates somewhere in every social form.My task here is not to show that there are cultures in which theincest taboo as such does not operate,but rather to underscore thegenerativity of that taboo,where it does operate,and not merely itsjuridical status.In other words,not only does the taboo forbid and dic-tate sexuality in certain forms,but it inadvertently produces a varietyof substitute desires and identities that are in no sense constrained inadvance,except insofar as they are “substitutes”in some sense.If weextend the Foucaultian critique to the incest taboo,then it seems thatthe taboo and the original desire for mother/father can be historicizedin ways that resist the formulaic universality of Lacan.The taboo mightbe understood to create and sustain the desire for the mother/father aswell as the compulsory displacement of that desire.The notion of an“original”sexuality forever repressed and forbidden thus becomes aproduction of the law which subsequently functions as its prohibition.If the mother is the original desire,and that may well be true for awide range of late-capitalist household dwellers,then that is a desireboth produced and prohibited within the terms of that cultural con-text.In other words,the law which prohibits that union is the selfsamelaw that invites it,and it is no longer possible to isolate the repressivefrom the productive function of the juridical incest taboo.Clearly,psychoanalytic theory has always recognized the produc-tive function of the incest taboo;it is what creates heterosexual desireand discrete gender identity.Psychoanalysis has also been clear that the incest taboo does not always operate to produce gender and desire

in the ways intended.The example of the negative Oedipal complex is but one occasion in which the prohibition against incest is clearlystronger with respect to the opposite-sexed parent than the same-sexedparent,and the parent prohibited becomes the figure of identification.But how would this example be redescribed within the conception ofthe incest taboo as both juridical and generative? The desire for the par-ent who,tabooed,becomes the figure of identification is both producedand denied by the same mechanism of power.But for what end? If theincest taboo regulates the production of discrete gender identities,andif that production requires the prohibition and sanction of heterosexu-ality,then homosexuality emerges as a desire which must be producedin order to remain repressed.In other words,for heterosexuality toremain intact as a distinct social form,it requiresan intelligible concep-tion of homosexuality and also requires the prohibition of that concep-tion in rendering it culturally unintelligible.Within psychoanalysis,bisexuality and homosexuality are taken to be primary libidinal disposi-tions,and heterosexuality is the laborious construction based upontheir gradual repression.While this doctrine seems to have a subversivepossibility to it,the discursive construction of both bisexuality andhomosexuality within the psychoanalytic literature effectively refutesthe claim to its precultural status.The discussion of the language ofbisexual dispositions above is a case in point.48The bisexuality that is said to be “outside”the Symbolic and that servesas the locus of subversion is,in fact,a construction within the terms ofthat constitutive discourse,the construction of an “outside”that is nev-ertheless fully “inside,”not a possibility beyond culture,but a concretecultural possibility that is refused and redescribed as impossible.Whatremains “unthinkable”and “unsayable”within the terms of an existingcultural form is not necessarily what is excluded from the matrix ofintelligibility within that form;on the contrary,it is the marginalized,not the excluded,the cultural possibility that calls for dread or,mini-

mally,the loss of sanctions.Not to have social recognition as an effec-tive heterosexual is to lose one possible social identity and perhaps togain one that is radically less sanctioned.The “unthinkable”is thus fullywithin culture,but fully excluded from dominantculture.The theorywhich presumes bisexuality or homosexuality as the “before”to cul-ture and then locates that “priority”as the source of a prediscursivesubversion,effectively forbids from within the terms of the culture thevery subversion that it ambivalently defends and defends against.As Iwill argue in the case of Kristeva,subversion thus becomes a futile ges-ture,entertained only in a derealized aesthetic mode which can neverbe translated into other cultural practices.In the case of the incest taboo,Lacan argues that desire (as opposedto need) is instituted through that law.“Intelligible”existence within theterms of the Symbolic requires both the institutionalization of desireand its dissatisfaction,the necessary consequence of the repression ofthe originalpleasure and need associated with the maternal body.Thisfull pleasure that haunts desire as that which it can never attain is theirrecoverable memory of pleasure before the law.Lacan is clear thatthat pleasure before the law is only fantasized,that it recurs in the infi-nite phantasms of desire.But in what sense is the phantasm,itself for-bidden from the literal recovery of an original pleasure,the constitutionof a fantasy of “originality”that may or may not correspond to a literallibidinal state? Indeed,to what extent is such a question decidable with-in the terms of Lacanian theory? A displacement or substitution canonly be understood as such in relation to an original,one which in thiscase can never be recovered or known.This speculative origin is alwaysspeculated about from a retrospective position,from which it assumesthe character of an ideal.The sanctification of this pleasurable “beyond”is instituted through the invocation of a Symbolic order that is essential-ly unchangeable.49Indeed,one needs to read the drama of theSymbolic,of desire,of the institution of sexual difference as a self-supporting signifying economy that wields power in the marking off of

what can and cannot be thought within the terms of cultural intelligibil-ity.Mobilizing the distinction between what is “before”and what is“during”culture is one way to foreclose cultural possibilities from thestart.The “order of appearances,”the founding temporality of theaccount,as much as it contests narrative coherence by introducing thesplit into the subject and the fêlureinto desire,reinstitutes a coherenceat the level of temporal exposition.As a result,this narrative strategy,revolving upon the distinction between an irrecoverable origin and aperpetually displaced present,makes all effort at recovering that originin the name of subversion inevitably belated.

3 Subversive Bodily Actsi.The Body Politics of Julia KristevaKristeva’s theory of the semiotic dimension of language at first appearsto engage Lacanian premises only to expose their limits and to offer aspecifically feminine locus of subversion of the paternal law within lan-guage.1According to Lacan,the paternal law structures all linguistic sig-nification,termed “the Symbolic,”and so becomes a universal organizingprinciple of culture itself.This law creates the possibility of meaningfullanguage and,hence,meaningful experience,through the repression ofprimary libidinal drives,including the radical dependency of the childon the maternal body.Hence,the Symbolic becomes possible by repudi-ating the primary relationship to the maternal body.The “subject”whoemerges as a consequence of this repression becomes a bearer or propo-nent of this repressive law.The libidinal chaos characteristic of that earlydependency is now fully constrained by a unitary agent whose languageis structured by that law.This language,in turn,structures the world bysuppressing multiple meanings (which always recall the libidinal multi-plicity which characterized the primary relation to the maternal body)and instating univocal and discrete meanings in their place.Kristeva challenges the Lacanian narrative which assumes culturalmeaning requires the repression of that primary relationship to thematernal body.She argues that the “semiotic”is a dimension of languageoccasioned by that primary maternal body,which not only refutesLacan’s primary premise,but serves as a perpetual source of subversionwithin the Symbolic.For Kristeva,the semiotic expresses that original

101




libidinal multiplicity within the very terms of culture,more precisely,within poetic language in which multiple meanings and semantic non-closure prevail.In effect,poetic language is the recovery of the mater-nal body within the terms of language,one that has the potential todisrupt,subvert,and displace the paternal law.Despite her critique of Lacan,however,Kristeva’s strategy of sub-version proves doubtful.Her theory appears to depend upon the sta-bility and reproduction of precisely the paternal law that she seeks todisplace.Although she effectively exposes the limits of Lacan’s effortsto universalize the paternal law in language,she nevertheless concedesthat the semiotic is invariably subordinate to the Symbolic,that itassumes its specificity within the terms of a hierarchy immune to chal-lenge.If the semiotic promotes the possibility of the subversion,dis-placement,or disruption of the paternal law,what meanings can thoseterms have if the Symbolic always reasserts its hegemony?The criticism of Kristeva which follows takes issue with severalsteps in Kristeva’s argument in favor of the semiotic as a source ofeffective subversion.First,it is unclear whether the primary relation-ship to the maternal body which both Kristeva and Lacan appear toaccept is a viable construct and whether it is even a knowable experi-ence according to either of their linguistic theories.The multipledrives that characterize the semiotic constitute a prediscursive libidi-nal economy which occasionally makes itself known in language,butwhich maintains an ontological status prior to language itself.Manifestin language,in poetic language in particular,this prediscursive libidinaleconomy becomes a locus of cultural subversion.A second problememerges when Kristeva argues that this libidinal source of subversioncannot be maintained within the terms of culture,that its sustainedpresence within culture leads to psychosis and to the breakdown ofcultural life itself.Kristeva thus alternately posits and denies the semi-otic as an emancipatory ideal.Though she tells us that it is a dimensionof language regularly repressed,she also concedes that it is a kind oflanguage which never can be consistently maintained.

In order to assess her seemingly self-defeating theory,we need toask how this libidinal multiplicity becomes manifest in language,andwhat conditions its temporary lifespan there? Moreover,Kristevadescribes the maternal body as bearing a set of meanings that are priorto culture itself.She thereby safeguards the notion of culture as apaternal structure and delimits maternity as an essentially preculturalreality.Her naturalistic descriptions of the maternal body effectivelyreify motherhood and preclude an analysis of its cultural constructionand variability.In asking whether a prediscursive libidinal multiplicityis possible,we will also consider whether what Kristeva claims to dis-cover in the prediscursive maternal body is itself a production of agiven historical discourse,an effect of culture rather than its secret andprimary cause.Even if we accept Kristeva’s theory of primary drives,it is unclearthat the subversive effects of such drives can serve,via the semiotic,asanything more than a temporary and futile disruption of the hegemonyof the paternal law.I will try to show how the failure of her politicalstrategy follows in part from her largely uncritical appropriation ofdrive theory.Moreover,upon careful scrutiny of her descriptions ofthe semiotic function within language,it appears that Kristeva rein-states the paternal law at the level of the semiotic itself.In the end,itseems that Kristeva offers us a strategy of subversion that can neverbecome a sustained political practice.In the final part of this section,Iwill suggest a way to reconceptualize the relation between drives,lan-guage,and patriarchal prerogative which might serve a more effectivestrategy of subversion.Kristeva’s description of the semiotic proceeds through a numberof problematic steps.She assumes that drives have aims prior to theiremergence into language,that language invariably represses or subli-mates these drives,and that such drives are manifest only in those lin-guistic expressions which disobey,as it were,the univocal requirementsof signification within the Symbolic domain.She claims further that the emergence of multiplicitous drives into language is evident in the

semiotic,that domain of linguistic meaning distinct from the Symbolic,which is the maternal body manifest in poetic speech.As early as Revolution in Poetic Language (1974),Kristeva argues fora necessary causal relation between the heterogeneity of drives and theplurivocal possibilities of poetic language.Differing from Lacan,shemaintains that poetic language is not predicated upon a repression ofprimary drives.On the contrary,poetic language,she claims,is the lin-guistic occasion on which drives break apart the usual,univocal termsof language and reveal an irrepressible heterogeneity of multiplesounds and meanings.Kristeva thereby contests Lacan’s equation ofthe Symbolic with all linguistic meaning by asserting that poetic lan-guage has its own modality of meaning which does not conform to therequirements of univocal designation.In this same work,she subscribes to a notion of free or uncathect-ed energy which makes itself known in language through the poeticfunction.She claims,for instance,that “in the intermingling of drivesin language ...we shall see the economy of poetic language”and thatin this economy,“the unitary subject can no longer find his [sic]place.”2 This poetic function is a rejective or divisive linguistic func-tion which tends to fracture and multiply meanings;it enacts the het-erogeneity of drives through the proliferation and destruction ofunivocal signification.Hence,the urge toward a highly differentiatedor plurivocal set of meanings appears as the revenge of drives againstthe rule of the Symbolic,which,in turn,is predicated upon theirrepression.Kristeva defines the semiotic as the multiplicity of drivesmanifest in language.With their insistent energy and heterogeneity,these drives disrupt the signifying function.Thus,in this early work,she defines the semiotic as “the signifying function ...connected tothe modality [of] primary process.”3In the essays that comprise Desire in Language (1977),Kristevaground her definition of the semiotic more fully in psychoanalyticterms.The primary drives that the Symbolic represses and the semioticobliquely indicates are now understood as maternal drives,not only

104




those drives belonging to the mother,but those which characterize thedependency of the infant’s body (of either sex) on the mother.In otherwords,“the maternal body”designates a relation of continuity ratherthan a discrete subject or object of desire;indeed,it designates thatjouissance which precedes desire and the subject/object dichotomy thatdesire presupposes.While the Symbolic is predicated upon the rejec-tion of the mother,the semiotic,through rhythm,assonance,intona-tions,sound play,and repetition,re-presents or recovers the maternalbody in poetic speech.Even the “first echolalias of infants”and the“glossalalias in psychotic discourse”are manifestations of the continu-ity of the mother-infant relation,a heterogeneous field of impulseprior to the separation/individuation of infant and mother,alikeeffected by the imposition of the incest taboo.4The separation of themother and infant effected by the taboo is expressed linguistically asthe severing of sound from sense.In Kristeva’s words,“a phoneme,asdistinctive element of meaning,belongs to language as Symbolic.Butthis same phoneme is involved in rhythmic,intonational repetitions;itthereby tends toward autonomy from meaning so as to maintain itselfin a semiotic disposition near the instinctual drive’s body.”5The semiotic is described by Kristeva as destroying or eroding theSymbolic;it is said to be “before”meaning,as when a child begins tovocalize,or “after”meaning,as when a psychotic no longer uses wordsto signify.If the Symbolic and the semiotic are understood as twomodalities of language,and if the semiotic is understood to be general-ly repressed by the Symbolic,then language for Kristeva is understoodas a system in which the Symbolic remains hegemonic except when thesemiotic disrupts its signifying process through elision,repetition,mere sound,and the multiplication of meaning through indefinitelysignifying images and metaphors.In its Symbolic mode,language restsupon a severance of the relation of maternal dependency,whereby itbecomes abstract (abstracted from the materiality of language) andunivocal;this is most apparent in quantitative or purely formal reason-ing.In its semiotic mode,language is engaged in a poetic recovery of

Subversive Bodily Acts

105




the maternal body,that diffuse materiality that resists all discrete andunivocal signification.Kristeva writes:In any poetic language,not only do the rhythmic constraints,forexample,go so far as to violate certain grammatical rules of a nation-al language ...but in recent texts,these semiotic constraints(rhythm,vocalic timbres in Symbolist work,but also graphic disposi-tion on the page) are accompanied by nonrecoverable syntacticelisions;it is impossible to reconstitute the particular elided syntac-tic category (object or verb),which makes the meaning of the utter-ance decidable.6For Kristeva,this undecidability is precisely the instinctual mo-ment in language,its disruptive function.Poetic language thus suggestsa dissolution of the coherent,signifying subject into the primary conti-nuity which is the maternal body:Language as Symbolic function constitutes itself at the cost of repress-ing instinctual drive and continuous relation to the mother.On thecontrary,the unsettled and questionable subject of poetic language(from whom the word is never uniquely sign) maintains itself at thecost of reactivating this repressed,instinctual,maternal element.7Kristeva’s references to the “subject”of poetic language are not whollyappropriate,for poetic language erodes and destroys the subject,where the subject is understood as a speaking being participating in theSymbolic.Following Lacan,she maintains that the prohibition againstthe incestuous union with the mother is the founding law of the sub-ject,a foundation which severs or breaks the continuous relation ofmaternal dependency.In creating the subject,the prohibitive law cre-ates the domain of the Symbolic or language as a system of univocallysignifying signs.Hence,Kristeva concludes that “poetic languagewould be for its questionable subject-in-process the equivalent ofincest.”8 The breaking of Symbolic language against its own foundinglaw or,equivalently,the emergence of rupture into language from

106




within its own interior instinctuality,is not merely the outburst oflibidinal heterogeneity into language;it also signifies the somatic stateof dependency on the maternal body prior to the individuation of theego.Poetic language thus always indicates a return to the maternal ter-rain,where the maternal signifies both libidinal dependency and theheterogeneity of drives.In “Motherhood According to Bellini,”Kristeva suggests that,because the maternal body signifies the loss of coherent and discreteidentity,poetic language verges on psychosis.And in the case of awoman’s semiotic expressions in language,the return to the maternalsignifies a prediscursive homosexuality that Kristeva also clearly asso-ciates with psychosis.Although Kristeva concedes that poetic languageis sustained culturally through its participation in the Symbolic and,hence,in the norms of linguistic communicability,she fails to allowthat homosexuality is capable of the same nonpsychotic social expres-sion.The key to Kristeva’s view of the psychotic nature of homosexual-ity is to be understood,I would suggest,in her acceptance of thestructuralist assumption that heterosexuality is coextensive with thefounding of the Symbolic.Hence,the cathexis of homosexual desirecan be achieved,according to Kristeva,only through displacementsthat are sanctioned within the Symbolic,such as poetic language or theact of giving birth:By giving birth,the women enters into contact with her mother;shebecomes,she is her own mother;they are the same continuity differ-entiating itself.She thus actualizes the homosexual facet of mother-hood,through which a woman is simultaneously closer to herinstinctual memory,more open to her psychosis,and consequently,more negatory of the social,symbolic bond.9According to Kristeva,the act of giving birth does not successfullyreestablish that continuous relation prior to individuation because the infant invariably suffers the prohibition on incest and is separatedoff as a discrete identity.In the case of the mother’s separation from

Subversive Bodily Acts

107




the girl-child,the result is melancholy for both,for the separation isnever fully completed.As opposed to grief or mourning,in which separation is recog-nized and the libido attached to the original object is successfully dis-placed onto a new substitute object,melancholy designates a failure togrieve in which the loss is simply internalized and,in that sense,refused.Instead of a negative attachment to the body,the maternal bodyis internalized as a negation,so that the girl’s identity becomes itself akind of loss,a characteristic privation or lack.The alleged psychosis of homosexuality,then,consists in its thor-ough break with the paternal law and with the grounding of the female“ego,”tenuous though it may be,in the melancholic response to sepa-ration from the maternal body.Hence,according to Kristeva,femalehomosexuality is the emergence of psychosis into culture:The homosexual-maternal facet is a whirl of words,a completeabsence of meaning and seeing;it is feeling,displacement,rhythm,sound,flashes,and fantasied clinging to the maternal body as ascreen against the plunge ...for woman,a paradise lost but seeming-ly close at hand.10For women,however,this homosexuality is manifest in poetic lan-guage which becomes,in fact,the only form of the semiotic,besideschildbirth,which can be sustained within the terms of the Symbolic.For Kristeva,then,overt homosexuality cannot be a culturally sustain-able activity,for it would constitute a breaking of the incest taboo in anunmediated way.And yet why is this the case?Kristeva accepts the assumption that culture is equivalent to theSymbolic,that the Symbolic is fully subsumed under the “Law of theFather,”and that the only modes of nonpsychotic activity are thosewhich participate in the Symbolic to some extent.Her strategic task,then,is neither to replace the Symbolic with the semiotic nor toestablish the semiotic as a rival cultural possibility,but rather to vali-date those experiences within the Symbolic that permit a manifesta-

108




tion of the borders which divide the Symbolic from the semiotic.Justas birth is understood to be a cathexis of instinctual drives for the pur-poses of a social teleology,so poetic production is conceived as thesite in which the split between instinct and representation exists inculturally communicable form:The speaker reaches this limit,this requisite of sociality,only byvirtue of a particular,discursive practice called “art.”A woman alsoattains it (and in our society,especially) through the strange form ofsplit symbolization (threshold of language and instinctual drive,ofthe “symbolic”and the “semiotic”) of which the act of giving birthconsists.11Hence,for Kristeva,poetry and maternity represent privilegedpractices within paternally sanctioned culture which permit a nonpsy-chotic experience of that heterogeneity and dependency characteristicof the maternal terrain.These acts of poesis reveal an instinctual hetero-geneity that subsequently exposes the repressed ground of the Sym-bolic,challenges the mastery of the univocal signifier,and diffuses theautonomy of the subject who postures as their necessary ground.Theheterogeneity of drives operates culturally as a subversive strategy ofdisplacement,one which dislodges the hegemony of the paternal lawby releasing the repressed multiplicity interior to language itself.Precisely because that instinctual heterogeneity must be re-presentedin and through the paternal law,it cannot defy the incest taboo alto-gether,but must remain within the most fragile regions of theSymbolic.Obedient,then,to syntactical requirements,the poetic-maternal practices of displacing the paternal law always remain tenu-ously tethered to that law.Hence,a full-scale refusal of the Symbolic isimpossible,and a discourse of “emancipation,”for Kristeva,is out ofthe question.At best,tactical subversions and displacements of the lawchallenge its self-grounding presumption.But,once again,Kristevadoes not seriously challenge the structuralist assumption that theprohibitive paternal law is foundational to culture itself.Hence,the

Subversive Bodily Acts

109




subversion of paternally sanctioned culture can not come from anotherversion of culture,but only from within the repressed interior of cul-ture itself,from the heterogeneity of drives that constitutes culture’sconcealed foundation.This relation between heterogeneous drives and the paternal lawproduces an exceedingly problematic view of psychosis.On the onehand,it designates female homosexuality as a culturally unintelligiblepractice,inherently psychotic:on the other hand,it mandates materni-ty as a compulsory defense against libidinal chaos.Although Kristevadoes not make either claim explicitly,both implications follow fromher views on the law,language,and drives.Consider that for Kristevapoetic language breaks the incest taboo and,as such,verges always on psychosis.As a return to the maternal body and a concomitant de-individuation of the ego,poetic language becomes especially threaten-ing when uttered by women.The poetic then contests not only theincest taboo,but the taboo against homosexuality as well.Poetic lan-guage is thus,for women,both displaced maternal dependency and,because that dependency is libidinal,displaced homosexuality.For Kristeva,the unmediated cathexis of female homosexualdesire leads unequivocally to psychosis.Hence,one can satisfy thisdrive only through a series of displacements:the incorporation ofmaternal identity—that is,by becoming a mother oneself—orthrough poetic language which manifests obliquely the heterogeneityof drives characteristic of maternal dependency.As the only sociallysanctioned and,hence,nonpsychotic displacements for homosexualdesire,both maternity and poetry constitute melancholic experiencesfor women appropriately acculturated into heterosexuality.The het-erosexual poet-mother suffers interminably from the displacement ofthe homosexual cathexis.And yet,the consummation of this desirewould lead to the psychotic unraveling of identity,according toKristeva—the presumption being that,for women,heterosexualityand coherent selfhood are indissolubly linked.How are we to understand this constitution of lesbian experience

as the site of an irretrievable self-loss? Kristeva clearly takes heterosex-uality to be prerequisite to kinship and to culture.Consequently,sheidentifies lesbian experience as the psychotic alternative to the accep-tance of paternally sanctioned laws.And yet why is lesbianism consti-tuted as psychosis? From what cultural perspective is lesbianismconstructed as a site of fusion,self-loss,and psychosis?By projecting the lesbian as “Other”to culture,and characterizinglesbian speech as the psychotic “whirl-of-words,”Kristeva constructslesbian sexuality as intrinsically unintelligible.This tactical dismissaland reduction of lesbian experience performed in the name of the lawpositions Kristeva within the orbit of paternal-heterosexual privilege.The paternal law which protects her from this radical incoherence isprecisely the mechanism that produces the construct of lesbianism as asite of irrationality.Significantly,this description of lesbian experienceis effected from the outside and tells us more about the fantasies that afearful heterosexual culture produces to defend against its own homo-sexual possibilities than about lesbian experience itself.In claiming that lesbianism designates a loss of self,Kristevaappears to be delivering a psychoanalytic truth about the repressionnecessary for individuation.The fear of such a “regression”to homo-sexuality is,then,a fear of losing cultural sanction and privilege alto-gether.Although Kristeva claims that this loss designates a place priorto culture,there is no reason not to understand it as a new or unac-knowledged cultural form.In other words,Kristeva prefers to explainlesbian experience as a regressive libidinal state prior to acculturationitself,rather than to take up the challenge that lesbianism offers to herrestricted view of paternally sanctioned cultural laws.Is the fearencoded in the construction of the lesbian as psychotic the result of adevelopmentally necessitated repression,or is it,rather,the fear of los-ing cultural legitimacy and,hence,being cast,not outside or prior toculture,but outside cultural legitimacy,still within culture,but cultur-ally “out-lawed”?Kristeva describes both the maternal body and lesbian experience

from a position of sanctioned heterosexuality that fails to acknowledgeits own fear of losing that sanction.Her reification of the paternal lawnot only repudiates female homosexuality,but denies the varied mean-ings and possibilities of motherhood as a cultural practice.But culturalsubversion is not really Kristeva’s concern,for subversion,when itappears,emerges from beneath the surface of culture only inevitably toreturn there.Although the semiotic is a possibility of language thatescapes the paternal law,it remains inevitably within or,indeed,beneath the territory of that law.Hence,poetic language and the plea-sures of maternity constitute local displacements of the paternal law,temporary subversions which finally submit to that against which theyinitially rebel.By relegating the source of subversion to a site outside ofculture itself,Kristeva appears to foreclose the possibility of subversionas an effective or realizable cultural practice.Pleasure beyond the pater-nal law can be imagined only together with its inevitable impossibility.Kristeva’s theory of thwarted subversion is premised on her prob-lematic view of the relation among drives,language,and the law.Herpostulation of a subversive multiplicity of drives raises a number ofepistemological and political questions.In the first place,if thesedrives are manifest only in language or cultural forms already deter-mined as Symbolic,then how is it that we can verify their pre-Symbolic ontological status? Kristeva argues that poetic language givesus access to these drives in their fundamental multiplicity,but thisanswer is not fully satisfactory.Since poetic language is said to dependupon the prior existence of these multiplicitous drives,we cannot,then,in circular fashion,justify the postulated existence of these drivesthrough recourse to poetic language.If drives must first be repressedfor language to exist,and if we can attribute meaning only to thatwhich is representable in language,then to attribute meaning to drivesprior to their emergence into language is impossible.Similarly,toattribute a causality to drives which facilitates their transformationinto language and by which language itself is to be explained cannotreasonably be done within the confines of language itself.In other

words,we know these drives as “causes”only in and through theireffects,and,as such,we have no reason for not identifying drives withtheir effects.It follows that either (a) drives and their representationsare coextensive or (b) representations preexist the drives themselves.This last alterative is,I would argue,an important one to consider,for how do we know that the instinctual object of Kristeva’s discourseis not a construction of the discourse itself? And what grounds do wehave for positing this object,this multiplicitous field,as prior to signi-fication? If poetic language must participate in the Symbolic in orderto be culturally communicable,and if Kristeva’s own theoretical textsare emblematic of the Symbolic,then where are we to find a convinc-ing “outside”to this domain? Her postulation of a prediscursive corpo-real multiplicity becomes all the more problematic when we discoverthat maternal drives are considered part of a “biological destiny”andare themselves manifestations of “a non-symbolic,nonpaternal causali-ty.”12This pre-Symbolic,nonpaternal causality is,for Kristeva,a semi-otic,maternal causality,or,more specifically,a teleological conceptionof maternal instincts:Material compulsion,spasm of a memory belonging to the speciesthat either binds together or splits apart to perpetuate itself,series ofmarkers with no other significance than the eternal return of thelife-death biological cycle.How can we verbalize this prelinguistic,unrepresentable memory? Heraclitus’flux,Epicurus’atoms,thewhirling dust of cabalic,Arab and Indian mystics,and the stippleddrawings of psychedelics—all seem better metaphors than the theo-ry of Being,the logos,and its laws.13Here,the repressed maternal body is not only the locus of multi-ple drives,but the bearer of a biological teleology as well,one which,it seems,makes itself evident in the early stages of Western philosophy,in non-Western religious beliefs and practices,in aesthetic representa-tions produced by psychotic or near-psychotic states,and even inavant-garde artistic practices.But why are we to assume that these

113




various cultural expressions manifest the selfsame principle of mater-nal heterogeneity? Kristeva simply subordinates each of these culturalmoments to the same principle.Consequently,the semiotic representsany cultural effort to displace the logos (which,curiously,she contrastswith Heraclitus’flux),where the logos represents the univocal signifi-er,the law of identity.Her opposition between the semiotic and theSymbolic reduces here to a metaphysical quarrel between the principleof multiplicity that escapes the charge of non-contradiction and a prin-ciple of identity based on the suppression of that multiplicity.Oddly,that very principle of multiplicity that Kristeva everywhere defendsoperates in much the same manner as a principle of identity.Note theway in which all manner of things “primitive”and “Oriental”are sum-marily subordinated to the principle of the maternal body.Surely,herdescription warrants not only the charge of Orientalism,but raises thevery significant question of whether,ironically,multiplicity hasbecome a univocal signifier.Her ascription of a teleological aim to maternal drives prior totheir constitution in language or culture raises a number of questionsabout Kristeva’s political program.Although she clearly sees subversiveand disruptive potential in those semiotic expressions that challenge thehegemony of the paternal law,it is less clear in what precisely this sub-version consists.If the law is understood to rest on a constructedground,beneath which lurks the repressed maternal terrain,what con-crete cultural options emerge within the terms of culture as a conse-quence of this revelation? Ostensibly,the multiplicity associated withthe maternal libidinal economy has the force to disperse the univocityof the paternal signifier and seemingly to create the possibility of othercultural expressions no longer tightly constrained by the law of non-contradiction.But is this disruptive activity the opening of a field of sig-nifications,or is it the manifestation of a biological archaism whichoperates according to a natural and “prepaternal”causality? If Kristevabelieved the former were the case (and she does not),then she wouldbe interested in a displacement of the paternal law in favor of a prolifer-

ating field of cultural possibilities.But instead,she prescribes a returnto a principle of maternal heterogeneity which proves to be a closedconcept,indeed,a heterogeneity confined by a teleology both unilinearand univocal.Kristeva understands the desire to give birth as a species-desire,part of a collective and archaic female libidinal drive that constitutesan ever-recurring metaphysical reality.Here Kristeva reifies maternityand then promotes this reification as the disruptive potential of thesemiotic.As a result,the paternal law,understood as the ground ofunivocal signification,is displaced by an equally univocal signifier,theprinciple of the maternal body which remains self-identical in its tele-ology regardless of its “multiplicitous”manifestations.Insofar as Kristeva conceptualizes this maternal instinct as havingan ontological status prior to the paternal law,she fails to consider theway in which that very law might well be the cause of the very desire itis said to repress.Rather than the manifestation of a prepaternal causali-ty,these desires might attest to maternity as a social practice requiredand recapitulated by the exigencies of kinship.Kristeva accepts Lévi-Strauss’s analysis of the exchange of women as prerequisite for theconsolidation of kinship bonds.She understands this exchange,howev-er,as the cultural moment in which the maternal body is repressed,rather than as a mechanism for the compulsory cultural constructionof the female body asa maternal body.Indeed,we might understandthe exchange of women as imposing a compulsory obligation onwomen’s bodies to reproduce.According to Gayle Rubin’s reading ofLévi-Strauss,kinship effects a “sculpting of ...sexuality”such that thedesire to give birth is the result of social practices which require andproduce such desires in order to effect their reproductive ends.14What grounds,then,does Kristeva have for imputing a maternalteleology to the female body prior to its emergence into culture? To pose the question in this way is already to question the distinctionbetween the Symbolic and the semiotic on which her conception of the maternal body is premised.The maternal body in its originary

signification is considered by Kristeva to be prior to significationitself;hence,it becomes impossible within her framework to considerthe maternal itself as a signification,open to cultural variability.Herargument makes clear that maternal drives constitute those primaryprocesses that language invariably represses or sublimates.But per-haps her argument could be recast within an even more encompassingframework:What cultural configuration of language,indeed,of dis-course,generates the trope of a pre-discursive libidinal multiplicity,andfor what purposes?By restricting the paternal law to a prohibitive or repressive func-tion,Kristeva fails to understand the paternal mechanisms by whichaffectivity itself is generated.The law that is said to repress the semi-otic may well be the governing principle of the semiotic itself,with theresult that what passes as “maternal instinct”may well be a culturallyconstructed desire which is interpreted through a naturalistic vocabu-lary.And if that desire is constructed according to a law of kinshipwhich requires the heterosexual production and reproduction ofdesire,then the vocabulary of naturalistic affect effectively rendersthat “paternal law”invisible.What for Kristeva is a pre-paternal causal-ity would then appear as a paternalcausality under the guise of a natur-al or distinctively maternal causality.Significantly,the figuration of the maternal body and the teleologyof its instincts as a self-identical and insistent metaphysical princi-ple—an archaism of a collective,sex-specific biological constitu-tion—bases itself on a univocal conception of the female sex.And thissex,conceived as both origin and causality,poses as a principle of puregenerativity.Indeed,for Kristeva,it is equated with poesisitself,thatactivity of making upheld in Plato’s Symposiumas an act of birth andpoetic conception at once.15But is female generativity truly anuncaused cause,and does it begin the narrative that takes all ofhumanity under the force of the incest taboo and into language? Doesthe pre-paternal causality whereof Kristeva speaks signify a primaryfemale economy of pleasure and meaning? Can we reverse the very

order of this causality and understand this semiotic economy as a pro-duction of a prior discourse?In the final chapter of Foucault’s first volume of The History of Sexuality,he cautions against using the category of sex as a “fictitious unity ...[and] causal principle”and argues that the fictitious category of sexfacilitates a reversal of causal relations such that “sex”is understood tocause the structure and meaning of desire:the notion of ‘sex’made it possible to group together,in an artificialunity,anatomical elements,biological functions,conducts,sensa-tions,and pleasures,and it enabled one to make use of this fictitiousunity as a causal principle,an omnipresent meaning:sex was thusable to function as a unique signifier and as a universal signified.16For Foucault,the body is not “sexed”in any significant sense prior toits determination within a discourse through which it becomes invest-ed with an “idea”of natural or essential sex.The body gains meaningwithin discourse only in the context of power relations.Sexuality is anhistorically specific organization of power,discourse,bodies,andaffectivity.As such,sexuality is understood by Foucault to produce“sex”as an artificial concept which effectively extends and disguisesthe power relations responsible for its genesis.Foucault’s framework suggests a way to solve some of the episte-mological and political difficulties that follow from Kristeva’s view ofthe female body.We can understand Kristeva’s assertion of a “prepater-nal causality”as fundamentally inverted.Whereas Kristeva posits amaternal body prior to discourse that exerts its own causal force in thestructure of drives,Foucault would doubtless argue that the discursiveproduction of the maternal body as prediscursive is a tactic in the self-amplification and concealment of those specific power relations bywhich the trope of the maternal body is produced.In these terms,thematernal body would no longer be understood as the hidden ground ofall signification,the tacit cause of all culture.It would be understood,

rather,as an effect or consequence of a system of sexuality in which thefemale body is required to assume maternity as the essence of its selfand the law of its desire.If we accept Foucault’s framework,we are compelled to redes-cribe the maternal libidinal economy as a product of an historicallyspecific organization of sexuality.Moreover,the discourse of sexuality,itself suffused by power relations,becomes the true ground of thetrope of the prediscursive maternal body.Kristeva’s formulation suf-fers a thoroughgoing reversal:The Symbolic and the semiotic are nolonger interpreted as those dimensions of language which follow uponthe repression or manifestation of the maternal libidinal economy.Thisvery economy is understood instead as a reification that both extendsand conceals the institution of motherhood as compulsory for women.Indeed,when the desires that maintain the institution of motherhoodare transvaluated as pre-paternal and pre-cultural drives,then theinstitution gains a permanent legitimation in the invariant structuresof the female body.Indeed,the clearly paternal law that sanctions andrequires the female body to be characterized primarily in terms of itsreproductive function is inscribed on that body as the law of its naturalnecessity.Kristeva,safeguarding that law of a biologically necessitatedmaternity as a subversive operation that pre-exists the paternal lawitself,aids in the systematic production of its invisibility and,conse-quently,the illusion of its inevitability.Because Kristeva restricts herself to an exclusively prohibitivecon-ception of the paternal law,she is unable to account for the ways inwhich the paternal law generatescertain desires in the form of naturaldrives.The female body that she seeks to express is itself a constructproduced by the very law it is supposed to undermine.In no way dothese criticisms of Kristeva’s conception of the paternal law necessari-ly invalidate her general position that culture or the Symbolic is predi-cated upon a repudiation of women’s bodies.I want to suggest,however,that any theory that asserts that signification is predicatedupon the denial or repression of a female principle ought to consider

whether that femaleness is really external to the cultural norms bywhich it is repressed.In other words,on my reading,the repression ofthe feminine does not require that the agency of repression and theobject of repression be ontologically distinct.Indeed,repression maybe understood to produce the object that it comes to deny.That pro-duction may well be an elaboration of the agency of repression itself.As Foucault makes clear,the culturally contradictory enterprise of themechanism of repression is prohibitive and generative at once andmakes the problematic of “liberation”especially acute.The female bodythat is freed from the shackles of the paternal law may well prove to beyet another incarnation of that law,posing as subversive but operatingin the service of that law’s self-amplification and proliferation.In orderto avoid the emancipation of the oppressor in the name of theoppressed,it is necessary to take into account the full complexity andsubtlety of the law and to cure ourselves of the illusion of a true bodybeyond the law.If subversion is possible,it will be a subversion fromwithin the terms of the law,through the possibilities that emerge whenthe law turns against itself and spawns unexpected permutations ofitself.The culturally constructed body will then be liberated,neitherto its “natural”past,nor to its original pleasures,but to an open futureof cultural possibilities.ii.Foucault,Herculine,and the Politics of Sexual DiscontinuityFoucault’s genealogical critique has provided a way to criticize thoseLacanian and neo-Lacanian theories that cast culturally marginal formsof sexuality as culturally unintelligible.Writing within the terms of adisillusionment with the notion of a liberatory Eros,Foucault under-stands sexuality as saturated with power and offers a critical view oftheories that lay claim to a sexuality before or after the law.When weconsider,however,those textual occasions on which Foucault criticizesthe categories of sex and the power regime of sexuality,it is clear thathis own theory maintains an unacknowledged emancipatory ideal that

proves increasingly difficult to maintain,even within the strictures ofhis own critical apparatus.Foucault’s theory of sexuality offered in The History of Sexuality,Volume Iis in some ways contradicted by his short but significant intro-duction to the journals he published of Herculine Barbin,a nineteenth-century French hermaphrodite.Herculine was assigned the sex of“female”at birth.In h/er early twenties,after a series of confessions todoctors and priests,s/he was legally compelled to change h/er sex to“male.”The journals that Foucault claims to have found are publishedin this collection,along with the medical and legal documents that dis-cuss the basis on which the designation of h/er “true”sex was decided.A satiric short story by the German writer,Oscar Panizza,is alsoincluded.Foucault supplies an introduction to the English translationof the text in which he questions whether the notion of a true sex isnecessary.At first,this question appears to be continuous with thecritical genealogy of the category of “sex”he offers toward the conclu-sion of the first volume of The History of Sexuality.17However,the jour-nals and their introduction offer an occasion to consider Foucault’sreading of Herculine against his theory of sexuality in The History ofSexuality,Volume I.Although he argues in The History of Sexualitythatsexuality is coextensive with power,he fails to recognize the concreterelations of power that both construct and condemn Herculine’s sexu-ality.Indeed,he appears to romanticize h/er world of pleasures as the“happy limbo of a non-identity”(xiii),a world that exceeds the cate-gories of sex and of identity.The reemergence of a discourse on sexualdifference and the categories of sex within Herculine’s own autobio-graphical writings will lead to an alternative reading of Herculineagainst Foucault’s romanticized appropriation and refusal of her text.In the first volume of The History of Sexuality,Foucault argues thatthe univocal construct of “sex”(one is one’s sex and,therefore,not theother) is (a) produced in the service of the social regulation and con-trol of sexuality and (b) conceals and artificially unifies a variety of dis-parate and unrelated sexual functions and then (c) postures within

discourse as a cause,an interior essence which both produces and ren-ders intelligible all manner of sensation,pleasure,and desire as sex-specific.In other words,bodily pleasures are not merely causallyreducible to this ostensibly sex-specific essence,but they become read-ily interpretable as manifestations or signs of this “sex.”18In opposition to this false construction of “sex”as both univocal andcausal,Foucault engages a reverse-discourse which treats “sex”as an effectrather than an origin.In the place of “sex”as the original andcontinuous cause and signification of bodily pleasures,he proposes“sexuality”as an open and complex historical system of discourse andpower that produces the misnomer of “sex”as part of a strategy to con-ceal and,hence,to perpetuate power-relations.One way in whichpower is both perpetuated and concealed is through the establishmentof an external or arbitrary relation between power,conceived asrepression or domination,and sex,conceived as a brave but thwartedenergy waiting for release or authentic self-expression.The use of thisjuridical model presumes that the relation between power and sexuali-ty is not only ontologically distinct,but that power always and onlyworks to subdue or liberate a sex which is fundamentally intact,self-sufficient,and other than power itself.When “sex”is essentialized inthis way,it becomes ontologically immunized from power relationsand from its own historicity.As a result,the analysis of sexuality is col-lapsed into the analysis of “sex,”and any inquiry into the historical pro-duction of the category of “sex”itself is precluded by this inverted andfalsifying causality.According to Foucault,“sex”must not only berecontextualized within the terms of sexuality,but juridical powermust be reconceived as a construction produced by a generative powerwhich,in turn,conceals the mechanism of its own productivity.the notion of sex brought about a fundamental reversal;it made itpossible to invert the representation of the relationships of power tosexuality,causing the latter to appear,not in its essential and positive

relation to power,but as being rooted in a specific and irreducibleurgency which power tries as best it can to dominate.(154)Foucault explicitly takes a stand against emancipatory or libera-tionist models of sexuality in The History of Sexualitybecause theysubscribe to a juridical model that does not acknowledge the histori-cal production of “sex”as a category,that is,as a mystifying “effect”ofpower relations.His ostensible problem with feminism seems also toemerge here:Where feminist analysis takes the category of sex and,thus,according to him,the binary restriction on gender,as its point ofdeparture,Foucault understands his own project to be an inquiry intohow the category of “sex”and sexual difference are constructed withindiscourse as necessary features of bodily identity.The juridical modelof law which structures the feminist emancipatory model presumes,inhis view,that the subject of emancipation,“the sexed body”in somesense,is not itself in need of a critical deconstruction.As Foucaultremarks about some humanist efforts at prison reform,the criminalsubject who gets emancipated may be even more deeply shackled than the humanist originally thought.To be sexed,for Foucault,is tobe subjected to a set of social regulations,to have the law that directsthose regulations reside both as the formative principle of one’s sex,gender,pleasures,and desires and as the hermeneutic principle of self-interpretation.The category of sex is thus inevitably regulative,andany analysis which makes that category presuppositional uncriticallyextends and further legitimates that regulative strategy as a power/knowledge regime.In editing and publishing the journals of Herculine Barbin,Foucault is clearly trying to show how an hermaphroditic or inter-sexed body implicitly exposes and refutes the regulative strategies ofsexual categorization.Because he thinks that “sex”unifies bodily func-tions and meanings that have no necessary relationship with one anoth-er,he predicts that the disappearance of “sex”results in a happydispersal of these various functions,meanings,organs,somatic and

physiological processes as well as in the proliferation of pleasures out-side of the framework of intelligibility enforced by univocal sexeswithin a binary relation.The sexual world in which Herculine resides,according to Foucault,is one in which bodily pleasures do not immedi-ately signify “sex”as their primary cause and ultimate meaning;it is aworld,he claims,in which “grins hung about without the cat”(xiii).Indeed,these are pleasures that clearly transcend the regulationimposed upon them,and here we see Foucault’s sentimental indul-gence in the very emancipatory discourse his analysis in The History ofSexualitywas meant to displace.According to this Foucaultian model ofemancipatory sexual politics,the overthrow of “sex”results in therelease of a primary sexual multiplicity,a notion not so far afield fromthe psychoanalytic postulation of primary polymorphousness orMarcuse’s notion of an original and creative bisexual Eros subsequent-ly repressed by an instrumentalist culture.The significant difference between Foucault’s position in the first vol-ume of The History of Sexualityand in his introduction to HerculineBarbinis already to be found as an unresolved tension within the Historyof Sexualityitself (he refers there to “bucolic”and “innocent”pleasuresof intergenerational sexual exchange that exist prior to the impositionof various regulative strategies [31]).On the one hand,Foucault wantsto argue that there is no “sex”in itself which is not produced by com-plex interactions of discourse and power,and yet there does seem tobe a “multiplicity of pleasures”in itselfwhich is not the effect of anyspecific discourse/power exchange.In other words,Foucault invokes atrope of prediscursive libidinal multiplicity that effectively presuppos-es a sexuality “before the law,”indeed,a sexuality waiting for emanci-pation from the shackles of “sex.”On the other hand,Foucaultofficially insists that sexuality and power are coextensive and that wemust not think that by saying yes to sex we say no to power.In his anti-juridical and anti-emancipatory mode,the “official”Foucault arguesthat sexuality is always situated within matrices of power,that it is

always produced or constructed within specific historical practices,both discursive and institutional,and that recourse to a sexualitybefore the law is an illusory and complicitous conceit of emancipatorysexual politics.The journals of Herculine provide the opportunity to readFoucault against himself,or,perhaps more appropriately,to expose theconstitutive contradiction of this kind of anti-emancipatory call forsexual freedom.Herculine,called Alexina throughout the text,nar-rates a story about h/er tragic plight as one who lives a life of unjustvictimization,deceit,longing,and inevitable dissatisfaction.From thetime s/he was a young girl,s/he reports,s/he was different from theother girls.This difference is a cause for alternating states of anxietyand self-importance through the story,but it is there as tacit knowl-edge before the law becomes an explicit actor in the story.AlthoughHerculine does not report directly on h/er anatomy in the journals,the medical reports that Foucault publishes along with Herculine’sown text suggest that Herculine might reasonably be said to have whatis described as either a small penis or an enlarged clitoris,that whereone might expect to find a vagina one finds a “cul-de-sac,”as the doc-tors put it,and,further,that she doesn’t appear to have identifiablyfemale breasts.There seems also to be some capacity for ejaculationthat is not fully accounted for within the medical documents.Herculine never refers to anatomy as such,but relates h/er predica-ment in terms of a natural mistake,a metaphysical homelessness,astate of insatiable desire,and a radical solitariness that,before h/ersuicide,is transformed into a full-blown rage,first directed towardmen,but finally toward the world as such.Herculine relates in elliptical terms h/er relations with the girls atschool,the “mothers”at the convent,and finally h/er most passionateattachment with Sara who becomes h/er lover.Plagued first with guiltand then with some unspecified genital ailment,Herculine exposesh/er secret to a doctor and then a priest,a set of confessional acts thateffectively force h/er separation from Sara.Authorities confer and

effect h/er legal transformation into a man whereupon s/he is legallyobligated to dress in men’s clothing and to exercise the various rights ofmen in society.Written in a sentimental and melodramatic tone,thejournals report a sense of perpetual crisis that culminates in suicide.One could argue that prior to the legal transformation of Alexina into aman,s/he was free to enjoy those pleasures that are effectively free ofthe juridical and regulatory pressures of the category of “sex.”Indeed,Foucault appears to think that the journals provide insight into preciselythat unregulated field of pleasures prior to the imposition of the law ofunivocal sex.His reading,however,constitutes a radical misreading ofthe way in which those pleasures are always already embedded in thepervasive but inarticulate law and,indeed,generated by the very lawthey are said to defy.The temptation to romanticize Herculine’s sexuality as the utopianplay of pleasures prior to the imposition and restrictions of “sex”sure-ly ought to be refused.It still remains possible,however,to ask thealternative Foucaultian question:What social practices and conven-tions produce sexuality in this form? In pursuing the question,wehave,I think,the opportunity to understand something about (a) theproductive capacity of power—that is,the way in which regulativestrategies produce the subjects they come to subjugate;and (b) thespecific mechanism by which power produces sexuality in the contextof this autobiographical narrative.The question of sexual differencereemerges in a new light when we dispense with the metaphysicalreification of multiplicitous sexuality and inquire in the case ofHerculine into the concrete narrative structures and political and cul-tural conventions that produce and regulate the tender kisses,the dif-fuse pleasures,and the thwarted and transgressive thrills ofHerculine’s sexual world.Among the various matrices of power that produce sexualitybetween Herculine and h/er partners are,clearly,the conventions offemale homosexuality both encouraged and condemned by the con-vent and its supporting religious ideology.One thing about Herculine

Subversive Bodily Acts

we know is that s/he reads,and reads a good deal,that h/er nineteenth-century French education involved schooling in the classics as well asFrench Romanticism,and that h/er own narrative takes place withinan established set of literary conventions.Indeed,these conventionsproduce and interpret for us this sexuality that both Foucault andHerculine take to be outside of all convention.Romantic and senti-mental narratives of impossible loves seem also to produce all mannerof desire and suffering in this text,and so do Christian legends aboutill-fated saints,Greek myths about suicidal androgynes,and,obviously,the Christ figure itself.Whether “before”the law as a multiplicitoussexuality or “outside”the law as an unnatural transgression,those posi-tionings are invariably “inside”a discourse which produces sexualityand then conceals that production through a configuring of a coura-geous and rebellious sexuality “outside”of the text itself.The effort to explain Herculine’s sexual relations with young girls through recourse to the masculine component of h/er biologicaldoubleness is,of course,the constant temptation of the text.IfHerculine desires a girl,then perhaps there is evidence in hormonal orchromosomal structures or in the anatomical presence of the imperfo-rate penis to suggest a more discrete,masculine sex that subsequentlygenerates heterosexual capacity and desire.The pleasures,the desires,the acts—do they not in some sense emanate from the biological body,and is there not some way of understanding that emanation as bothcausally necessitated by that body and expressive of its sex-specificity?Perhaps because Herculine’s body is hermaphroditic,the struggleto separate conceptually the description of h/er primary sexual char-acteristics from h/er gender identity (h/er sense of h/er own genderwhich,by the way,is ever-shifting and far from clear) and the direc-tionality and objects of h/er desire is especially difficult.S/he herselfpresumes at various points that h/er body is the causeof h/er genderconfusion and h/er transgressive pleasures,as if they were both resultand manifestation of an essence which somehow falls outside the nat-ural/metaphysical order of things.But rather than understand h/er

anomalous body as the cause of h/er desire,h/er trouble,h/er affairsand confession,we might read this body,here fully textualized,as asign of an irresolvable ambivalence produced by the juridical discourseon univocal sex.In the place of univocity,we fail to discover multiplic-ity,as Foucault would have us do;instead,we confront a fatal ambiva-lence,produced by the prohibitive law,which for all its effects ofhappy dispersal nevertheless culminates in Herculine’s suicide.If one follows Herculine’s narrative self-exposition,itself a kind ofconfessional production of the self,it seems that h/er sexual disposi-tion is one of ambivalence from the outset,that h/er sexuality recapit-ulates the ambivalent structure of its production,construed in part asthe institutional injunction to pursue the love of the various “sisters”and “mothers”of the extended convent family and the absolute prohi-bition against carrying that love too far.Foucault inadvertently sug-gests that Herculine’s “happy limbo of a non-identity”was madepossible by an historically specific formation of sexuality,namely,“hersequestered existence among the almost exclusive company ofwomen.”This “strange happiness,”as he describes it,was at once“obligatory and forbidden”within the confines of convent conven-tions.His clear suggestion here is that this homosexual environment,structured as it is by an eroticized taboo,was one in which this “happylimbo of a non-identity”is subtly promoted.Foucault then swiftlyretracts the suggestion of Herculine as participating in a practice offemale homosexual conventions,insisting that “non-identity”ratherthan a variety of female identities is at play.For Herculine to occupythe discursive position of “the female homosexual”would be forFoucault to engage the category of sex—precisely what Foucaultwants Herculine’s narrative to persuade us to reject.But perhaps Foucault does want to have it both ways;indeed,hewants implicitly to suggest that nonidentity is what is produced inhomosexual contexts—namely,that homosexuality is instrumental tothe overthrow of the category of sex.Note in Foucault’s followingdescription of Herculine’s pleasures how the category of sex is at once

invoked and refused:The school and the convent “foster the tenderpleasures that sexual nonidentity discovers and provokes when it goesastray in the midst of all those bodies that are similar to one another”(xiv).Here Foucault assumes that the likenesses of these bodies condi-tion the happy limbo of their nonidentity,a difficult formulation toaccept both logically and historically,but also as an adequate descrip-tion of Herculine.Is it the awareness of their likeness that conditionsthe sexual play of the young women in the convent,or is it,rather,theeroticized presence of the law forbidding homosexuality that producesthese transgressive pleasures in the compulsory mode of a confession-al? Herculine maintains h/er own discourse of sexual difference evenwithin this ostensibly homosexual context:s/he notes and enjoys h/erdifference from the young women s/he desires,and yet this differenceis not a simple reproduction of the heterosexual matrix for desire.S/he knows that her position in that exchange is transgressive,that sheis a “usurper”of a masculine prerogative,as s/he puts it,and that s/hecontests that privilege even as s/he replicates it.The language of usurpation suggests a participation in the very cat-egories from which s/he feels inevitably distanced,suggesting also thedenaturalized and fluid possibilities of such categories once they are nolonger linked causally or expressively to the presumed fixity of sex.Herculine’s anatomy does not fall outside the categories of sex,butconfuses and redistributes the constitutive elements of those cate-gories;indeed,the free play of attributes has the effect of exposing the illusory character of sex as an abiding substantive substrate towhich these various attributes are presumed to adhere.Moreover,Herculine’s sexuality constitutes a set of gender transgressions whichchallenge the very distinction between heterosexual and lesbian eroticexchange,underscoring the points of their ambiguous convergenceand redistribution.But it seems we are compelled to ask,is there not,even at the levelof a discursively constituted sexual ambiguity,some questions of “sex”and,indeed,of its relation to “power”that set limits on the free play of

sexual categories? In other words,how free is that play,whether con-ceived as a prediscursive libidinal multiplicity or as a discursively con-stituted multiplicity? Foucault’s original objection to the category ofsex is that it imposes the artifice of unity and univocity on a set of onto-logically disparate sexual functions and elements.In an almostRousseauian move,Foucault constructs the binary of an artificial cul-tural law that reduces and distorts what we might well understand as anaturalheterogeneity.Herculine h/erself refers to h/er sexuality as“this incessant struggle of nature against reason”(103).A cursory exam-ination of these disparate “elements,”however,suggests their thoroughmedicalization as “functions,”“sensations,”even “drives.”Hence,theheterogeneity to which Foucault appeals is itself constituted by the verymedical discourse that he positions as the repressive juridical law.Butwhat is this heterogeneity that Foucault seems to prize,and what pur-pose does it serve?If Foucault contends that sexual nonidentity is promoted in homo-sexual contexts,he would seem to identify heterosexual contexts asprecisely those in which identity is constituted.We know already thathe understands the category of sex and of identity generally to be theeffect and instrument of a regulatory sexual regime,but it is less clearwhether that regulation is reproductive or heterosexual,or somethingelse.Does that regulation of sexuality produce male and female identi-ties within a symmetrical binary relation? If homosexuality producessexual nonidentity,then homosexuality itself no longer relies on iden-tities being likeone another;indeed,homosexuality could no longer bedescribed as such.But if homosexuality is meant to designate the placeof an unnameablelibidinal heterogeneity,perhaps we can ask whetherthis is,instead,a love that either cannot or dare not speak its name? Inother words,Foucault,who gave only one interview on homosexualityand has always resisted the confessional moment in his own work,nev-ertheless presents Herculine’s confession to us in an unabashedlydidactic mode.Is this a displaced confession that presumes a continuityor parallel between his life and hers?

On the cover of the French edition,he remarks that Plutarchunderstood illustrious persons to constitute parallellives which in somesense travel infinite lines that eventually meet in eternity.He remarksthat there are some lives that veer off the track of infinity and threatento disappear into an obscurity that can never be recovered—lives thatdo not follow the “straight”path,as it were,into an eternal communityof greatness,but deviate and threaten to become fully irrecoverable.“That would be the inverse of Plutarch,”he writes,“lives at parallelpoints that nothing can bring back together”(my translation).Here thetextual reference is most clearly to the separation of Herculine,theadopted male name (though with a curiously feminine ending),andAlexina,the name that designated Herculine in the female mode.But itis also a reference to Herculine and Sara,h/er lover,who are quite lit-erally separated and whose paths quite obviously diverge.But perhapsHerculine is in some sense also parallel to Foucault,parallel precisely inthe sense in which divergent lifelines,which are in no sense “straight,”might well be.Indeed,perhaps Herculine and Foucault are parallel,notin any literal sense,but in their very contestation of the literal as such,especially as it applies to the categories of sex.Foucault’s suggestion in the preface that there are bodies which arein some sense “similar”to each other disregards the hermaphroditicdistinctness of Herculine’s body,as well as h/er own presentation ofh/erself as very much unlike the women s/he desires.Indeed,aftersome manner of sexual exchange,Herculine engages the language ofappropriation and triumph,avowing Sara as her eternal property whenshe remarks,“From that moment on,Sara belonged to me ...!!!”(51).So why would Foucault resist the very text that he wants to use inorder to make such a claim? In the one interview Foucault gave onhomosexuality,James O’Higgins,the interviewer,remarks that “thereis a growing tendency in American intellectual circles,particularlyamong radical feminists,to distinguish between male and femalehomosexuality,”a position,he argues,that claims that very differentthings happen physically in the two sorts of encounters and that les-

bians tend to prefer monogamy and the like while gay men generallydo not.Foucault responds by laughing,suggested by the bracketed“[Laughs],”and he says,“All I can do is explode with laughter.”19Thisexplosive laughter,we may remember,also followed Foucault’s read-ing of Borges,reported in the preface to The Order of Things (Les mots etles choses):This book first arose out of a passage in Borges,out of the laughterthat shattered,as I read the passage,all the familiar landmarks of mythought ...breaking up all the ordered surfaces and all the planeswith which we are accustomed to tame the wild profusion of existingthings,and continuing long afterwards to disturb and threaten withcollapse our age-old distinction between the Same and the Other.20The passage is,of course,from the Chinese encyclopedia which con-founds the Aristotelian distinction between universal categories andparticular instances.But there is also the “shattering laughter”of PierreRivière whose murderous destruction of his family,or,perhaps,forFoucault,of thefamily,seems quite literally to negate the categories ofkinship and,by extension,of sex.21And there is,of course,Bataille’snow famous laughter which,Derrida tells us in Writing and Difference,designates that excess that escapes the conceptual mastery of Hegel’sdialectic.22Foucault,then,seems to laugh precisely because the ques-tion instates the very binary that he seeks to displace,that dreary bina-ry of Same and Other that has plagued not only the legacy of dialectics,but the dialectic of sex as well.But then there is,of course,the laughof Medusa,which,Hélène Cixous tells us,shatters the placid surfaceconstituted by the petrifying gaze and which exposes the dialectic ofSame and Other as taking place through the axis of sexual difference.23In a gesture that resonates self-consciously with the tale of Medusa,Herculine h/erself writes of “the cold fixity of my gaze [that] seems tofreeze”(105) those who encounter it.But it is,of course,Irigaray who exposes this dialectic of Same andOther as a false binary,the illusion of a symmetrical difference which

consolidates the metaphysical economy of phallogocentrism,the econ-omy of the same.In her view,the Other as well as the Same are markedas masculine;the Other is but the negative elaboration of the mascu-line subject with the result that the female sex is unrepresentable—that is,it is the sex which,within this signifying economy,is not one.But it is not one also in the sense that it eludes the univocal significa-tion characteristic of the Symbolic,and because it is not a substantiveidentity,but always and only an undetermined relation of difference tothe economy which renders it absent.It is not “one”in the sense that itis multiple and diffuse in its pleasures and its signifying mode.Indeed,perhaps Herculine’s apparently multiplicitous pleasures would qualifyfor the mark of the feminine in its polyvalence and in its refusal to sub-mit to the reductive efforts of univocal signification.But let us not forget Herculine’s relation to the laugh which seemsto appear twice,first in the fear of being laughed at(23) and later as alaugh of scorn that s/he directs against the doctor,for whom s/heloses respect after he fails to tell the appropriate authorities of the nat-ural irregularity that has been revealed to him (71).For Herculine,then,laughter appears to designate either humiliation or scorn,twopositions unambiguously related to a damning law,subjected to iteither as its instrument or object.Herculine does not fall outside thejurisdiction of that law;even h/er exile is understood on the model ofpunishment.On the very first page,s/he reports that h/er “place wasnot marked out [pas marquée] in this world that shunned me.”And s/hearticulates the early sense of abjection that is later enacted first as adevoted daughter or lover to be likened to a “dog”or a “slave”and thenfinally in a full and fatal form as s/he is expelled and expels h/erselffrom the domain of all human beings.From this presuicidal isolation,s/he claims to soar above both sexes,but h/er anger is most fullydirected against men,whose “title”s/he sought to usurp in h/er inti-macy with Sara and whom s/he now indicts without restraint as thosewho somehow forbid h/er the possibility of love.At the beginning of the narrative,s/he offers two one-sentence

132




paragraphs “parallel”to one another which suggest a melancholicincorporation of the lost father,a postponement of the anger of aban-donment through the structural instatement of that negativity intoh/er identity and desire.Before s/he tells us that s/he h/erself wasabandoned by h/er mother quickly and without advance notice,s/hetells us that for reasons unstated s/he spent a few years in a house forabandoned and orphaned children.S/he refers to the “poor creatures,deprived from their cradle of a mother’s love.”In the next sentences/he refers to this institution as a “refuge [asile] of suffering and afflic-tion,”and in the following sentence refers to h/er father “whom asudden death tore away ...from the tender affection of my mother”(4).Although h/er own abandonment is twice deflected here throughthe pity for others who are suddenly rendered motherless,s/he estab-lishes an identification through that deflection,one that later reappearsas the joint plight of father and daughter cut off from the maternalcaress.The deflections of desire are semantically compounded,as itwere,as Herculine proceeds to fall in love with “mother”after “moth-er”and then falls in love with various mothers’“daughters,”whichscandalizes all manner of mother.Indeed,s/he vacillates betweenbeing the object of everyone’s adoration and excitement and an objectof scorn and abandonment,the split consequence of a melancholicstructure left to feed on itself without intervention.If melancholyinvolves self-recrimination,as Freud argues,and if that recriminationis a kind of negative narcissism (attending to the self,even if only in themode of berating that self),then Herculine can be understood to beconstantly falling into the opposition between negative and positivenarcissism,at once avowing h/erself as the most abandoned andneglected creature on earth but also as the one who casts a spell ofenchantment on everyone who comes near h/er,indeed,one who isbetter for all women than any “man”(107).S/he refers to the hospital for orphaned children as that early“refuge of suffering,”an abode that s/he figuratively reencounters atthe close of the narrative as the “refuge of the tomb.”Just as that early

refuge provides a magical communion and identification with thephantom father,so the tomb of death is already occupied by the veryfather whom s/he hopes death will let h/er meet:“The sight of thetomb reconciles me to life,”she writes.“It makes me feel an indefin-able tenderness for the one whose bones are lying there beneath myfeet [là à mes pieds]”(109).But this love,formulated as a kind of soli-darity against the abandoning mother,is itself in no way purified of theanger of abandonment:The father “beneath [h/er] feet”is earlierenlarged to become the totality of men over whom s/he soars,andwhom s/he claims to dominate (107),and toward whom s/he directsh/er laugh of disdain.Earlier s/he remarks about the doctor who dis-covered h/er anomalous condition,“I wished he were a hundred feetunderground!”(69).Herculine’s ambivalence here implies the limits of Foucault’s theo-ry of the “happy limbo of a non-identity.”Almost prefiguring the placeHerculine will assume for Foucault,s/he wonders whether s/he is not“the plaything of an impossible dream”(79).Herculine’s sexual dispo-sition is one of ambivalence from the outset,and,as argued earlier,h/er sexuality recapitulates the ambivalent structure of its production,construed in part as the institutional injunction to pursue the love ofthe various “sisters”and “mothers”of the extended convent family andthe absolute prohibition against carrying that love too far.H/er sexual-ity is not outside the law,but is the ambivalent production of the law,one in which the very notion of prohibitionspans the psychoanalyticand institutional terrains.H/er confessions,as well as h/er desires,aresubjection and defiance at once.In other words,the love prohibited bydeath or abandonment,or both,is a love that takes prohibition to be itscondition and its aim.After submitting to the law,Herculine becomes a juridically sanc-tioned subject as a “man,”and yet the gender category proves less fluidthan h/er own references to Ovid’s Metamorphosessuggest.H/er het-eroglossic discourse challenges the viability of the notion of a “person”who might be said to preexist gender or exchange one gender for the

other.If s/he is not actively condemned by others,s/he condemnsh/erself (even calls h/erself a “judge”[106]),revealing that the juridi-cal law in effect is much greater than the empirical law that effectsh/er gender conversion.Indeed,Herculine can never embody that lawprecisely because s/he cannot provide the occasion by which that lawnaturalizes itself in the symbolic structures of anatomy.In otherwords,the law is not simply a cultural imposition on an otherwise nat-ural heterogeneity;the law requires conformity to its own notion of“nature”and gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetricalnaturalization of bodies in which the Phallus,though clearly not identi-cal with the penis,nevertheless deploys the penis as its naturalizedinstrument and sign.Herculine’s pleasures and desires are in no way the bucolic inno-cence that thrives and proliferates prior to the imposition of a juridicallaw.Neither does s/he fully fall outside the signifying economy of mas-culinity.S/he is “outside”the law,but the law maintains this “outside”within itself.In effect,s/he embodies the law,not as an entitled sub-ject,but as an enacted testimony to the law’s uncanny capacity to pro-duce only those rebellions that it can guarantee will—out offidelity—defeat themselves and those subjects who,utterly subjected,have no choice but to reiterate the law of their genesis.Concluding Unscientific PostscriptWithin The History of Sexuality,Volume I,Foucault appears to locate thequest for identity within the context of juridical forms of power thatbecome fully articulate with the advent of the sexual sciences,includ-ing psychoanalysis,toward the end of the nineteenth century.AlthoughFoucault revised his historiography of sex at the outset of The Use ofPleasure(L’Usage des plaisirs) and sought to discover the repressive/gen-erative rules of subject-formation in early Greek and Roman texts,hisphilosophical project to expose the regulatory production of identity-effects remained constant.A contemporary example of this quest foridentity can be found in recent developments in cell biology,an exam-

ple that inadvertently confirms the continuing applicability of aFoucaultian critique.One place to interrogate the univocity of sex is the recent contro-versy over the master gene that researchers at MIT in late 1987 claimto have discovered as the secret and certain determinant of sex.Withthe use of highly sophisticated technological means,the master gene,which constitutes a specific DNA sequence on the Y chromosome,wasdiscovered by Dr.David Page and his colleagues and named “TDF”ortestis-determining factor.In the publication of his findings in Cell(No.51),Dr.Page claimed to have discovered “the binary switch uponwhich hinges all sexually dimorphic characteristics.”24Let us then con-sider the claims of this discovery and see why the unsettling questionsregarding the decidability of sex continue to be asked.According to Page’s article,“The Sex-Determining Region of theHuman Y Chromosome Encodes a Finger Protein,”samples of DNAwere taken from a highly unusual group of people,some of whom hadXX chromosomes,but had been medically designated as males,andsome of whom had XY chromosomal constitution,but had been med-ically designated as female.He does not tell us exactly on what basisthey had been designated contrary to the chromosomal findings,butwe are left to presume that obvious primary and secondary character-istics suggested that those were,indeed,the appropriate designations.Page and his coworkers made the following hypothesis:There must besome stretch of DNA,which cannot be seen under the usual micro-scopic conditions,that determines the male sex,and this stretch ofDNA must have been moved somehow from the Y chromosome,itsusual location,to some other chromosome,where one would notexpect to find it.Only if we could presume (a) this undetectable DNAsequence and (b) prove its translocatability,could we understand whyit is that an XX male had no detectable Y chromosome,but was,in fact,still male.Similarly,we could explain the curious presence of the Ychromosome on females precisely because that stretch of DNA hadsomehow been misplaced.

Although the pool that Page and his researchers used to come upwith this finding was limited,the speculation on which they base theirresearch,in part,is that a good ten percent of the population haschromosomal variations that do not fit neatly into the XX-female and XY-male set of categories.Hence,the discovery of the “master-gene”is considered to be a more certain basis for understanding sex-determination and,hence,sex-difference,than previous chromosomalcriteria could provide.Unfortunately for Page,there was one persistent problem thathaunted the claims made on behalf of the discovery of the DNAsequence.Exactly the same stretch of DNA said to determine male-ness was,in fact,found to be present on the X chromosomes offemales.Page first responded to this curious discovery by claiming thatperhaps it was not the presenceof the gene sequence in males versus itsabsencein females that was determining,but that it was activein malesand passivein females (Aristotle lives!).But this suggestion remainshypothetical and,according to Anne Fausto-Sterling,Page and hiscoworkers failed to mention in that Cellarticle that the individualsfrom whom the gene samples were taken were far from unambiguousin their anatomical and reproductive constitutions.I quote from herarticle,“Life in the XY Corral”:the four XX males whom they studied were all sterile (no spermproduction),had small testes which totally lacked germ cells,i.e.,precursor cells for sperms.They also had high hormone levels andlow testosterone levels.Presumably they were classified as malesbecause of their external genitalia and the presence of testes....Similarly ...both of the XY females’external genitalia were normal,[but] their ovaries lacked germ cells.(328)Clearly these are cases in which the component parts of sex do notadd up to the recognizable coherence or unity that is usually designatedby the category of sex.This incoherence troubles Page’s argument aswell,for it is unclear why we should agree at the outset that these are

XX-males and XY-females,when it is precisely the designation of maleand female that is under question and that is implicitly already decidedby the recourse to external genitalia.Indeed,if external genitalia weresufficient as a criterion by which to determine or assign sex,then theexperimental research into the master gene would hardly be necessaryat all.But consider a different kind of problem with the way in which that particular hypothesis is formulated,tested,and validated.Noticethat Page and his coworkers conflate sex-determination with male-determination,and with testis-determination.Geneticists Eva Eicherand Linda L.Washburn in the Annual Review of Geneticssuggest thatovary-determination is never considered in the literature on sex-determination and that femaleness is always conceptualized in terms ofthe absence of the male-determining factor or of the passive presenceof that factor.As absent or passive,it is definitionally disqualified as anobject of study.Eicher and Washburn suggest,however,that it isactiveand that a cultural prejudice,indeed,a set of gendered assumptionsabout sex,and about what might make such an inquiry valuable,skewand limit the research into sex-determination.Fausto-Sterling quotesEicher and Washburn:Some investigators have overemphasized the hypothesis that the Ychromosome is involved in testis-determination by presenting theinduction of testicular tissue as an active,(gene-directed,dominant)event while presenting the induction of ovarian tissue as a passive(automatic) event.Certainly,the induction of ovarian tissue is asmuch an active,genetically directed developmental process as theinduction of testicular tissue,or for that matter,the induction of anycellular differentiation process.Almost nothing has been writtenabout genes involved in the induction of ovarian tissue from theundifferentiated gonad.(325)In related fashion,the entire field of embryology has come undercriticism for its focus on the central role of the nucleus in cell differen-

tiation.Feminist critics of the field of molecular cell biology haveargued against its nucleocentric assumptions.As opposed to a researchorientation that seeks to establish the nucleus of a fully differentiatedcell as the master or director of the development of a complete andwell-formed new organism,a research program is suggested thatwould reconceive the nucleus as something which gains its meaningand control only within its cellular context.According to Fausto-Sterling,“the question to ask is not how a cell nucleus changes duringdifferentiation,but,rather,how the dynamic nuclear-cytoplasmicinteractions alter during differentation”(323–24).The structure of Page’s inquiry fits squarely within the generaltrends of molecular cell biology.The framework suggests a refusal fromthe outset to consider that these individuals implicitly challenge thedescriptive force of the available categories of sex;the question he pur-sues is that of how the “binary switch”gets started,not whether thedescription of bodies in terms of binary sex is adequate to the task athand.Moreover,the concentration on the “master gene”suggests thatfemaleness ought to be understood as the presence or absence of maleness or,at best,the presence of a passivity that,in men,wouldinvariably be active.This claim is,of course,made within the re-search context in which active ovarian contributions to sex differen-tiation have never been strongly considered.The conclusion here is not that valid and demonstrable claims cannot be made about sex-determination,but rather that cultural assumptions regarding the rela-tive status of men and women and the binary relation of gender itselfframe and focus the research into sex-determination.The task of distin-guishing sex from gender becomes all the more difficult once we under-stand that gendered meanings frame the hypothesis and the reasoning ofthose biomedical inquiries that seek to establish “sex”for us as it is priorto the cultural meanings that it acquires.Indeed,the task is even morecomplicated when we realize that the language of biology participatesin other kinds of languages and reproduces that cultural sedimentationin the objects it purports to discover and neutrally describe.

Is it not a purely cultural convention to which Page and others referwhen they decide that an anatomically ambiguous XX individual ismale,a convention that takes genitalia to be the definitive “sign”of sex?One might argue that the discontinuities in these instances cannot beresolved through recourse to a single determinant and that sex,as a cat-egory that comprises a variety of elements,functions,and chromoso-mal and hormonal dimensions,no longer operates within the binaryframework that we take for granted.The point here is not to seekrecourse to the exceptions,the bizarre,in order merely to relativize theclaims made in behalf of normal sexual life.As Freud suggests in ThreeEssays on the Theory of Sexuality,however,it is the exception,the strange,that gives us the clue to how the mundane and taken-for-granted worldof sexual meanings is constituted.Only from a self-consciously denatu-ralized position can we see how the appearance of naturalness is itselfconstituted.The presuppositions that we make about sexed bodies,about them being one or the other,about the meanings that are said toinhere in them or to follow from being sexed in such a way are sudden-ly and significantly upset by those examples that fail to comply with thecategories that naturalize and stabilize that field of bodies for us withinthe terms of cultural conventions.Hence,the strange,the incoherent,that which falls “outside,”gives us a way of understanding the taken-for-granted world of sexual categorization as a constructed one,indeed,asone that might well be constructed differently.Although we may not immediately agree with the analysis thatFoucault supplies—namely,that the category of sex is constructed inthe service of a system of regulatory and reproductive sexuality—it isinteresting to note that Page designates the external genitalia,thoseanatomical parts essential to the symbolization of reproductive sexual-ity,as the unambiguous and a priori determinants of sex assignment.One might well argue that Page’s inquiry is beset by two discoursesthat,in this instance,conflict:the cultural discourse that takes externalgenitalia to be the sure signs of sex,and does that in the service ofreproductive interests,and the discourse that seeks to establish the

male principle as active and monocausal,if not autogenetic.The desireto determine sex once and for all,and to determine it as one sex ratherthan the other,thus seems to issue from the social organization of sex-ual reproduction through the construction of the clear and unequivo-cal identities and positions of sexed bodies with respect to each other.Because within the framework of reproductive sexuality the malebody is usually figured as the active agent,the problem with Page’sinquiry is,in a sense,to reconcile the discourse of reproduction withthe discourse of masculine activity,two discourses that usually worktogether culturally,but in this instance have come apart.Interesting,then,is Page’s willingness to settle on the active DNA sequence as thelast word,in effect giving the principle of masculine activity priorityover the discourse of reproduction.This priority,however,would constitute only an appearance,according to the theory of Monique Wittig.The category of sex be-longs to a system of compulsory heterosexuality that clearly operatesthrough a system of compulsory sexual reproduction.In Wittig’s view,to which we now turn,“masculine”and “feminine,”“male”and “female”exist onlywithin the heterosexual matrix;indeed,they are the natural-ized terms that keep that matrix concealed and,hence,protected froma radical critique.iii.Monique Wittig:Bodily Disintegration andFictive SexLanguage casts sheaves of reality upon the social body.—Monique WittigSimone de Beauvoir wrote in The Second Sexthat “one is not born awoman,but rather becomesone.”The phrase is odd,even nonsensical,for how can one become a woman if one wasn’t a woman all along?And who is this “one”who does the becoming? Is there some humanwho becomes its gender at some point in time? Is it fair to assume thatthis human was not its gender before it became its gender? How doesone “become”a gender? What is the moment or mechanism of gender

construction? And,perhaps most pertinently,when does this mecha-nism arrive on the cultural scene to transform the human subject intoa gendered subject?Are there ever humans who are not,as it were,always already gen-dered? The mark of gender appears to “qualify”bodies as human bod-ies;the moment in which an infant becomes humanized is when thequestion,“is it a boy or girl?”is answered.Those bodily figures who do not fit into either gender fall outside the human,indeed,constitutethe domain of the dehumanized and the abject against which thehuman itself is constituted.If gender is always there,delimiting inadvance what qualifies as the human,how can we speak of a humanwho becomes its gender,as if gender were a postscript or a culturalafterthought?Beauvoir,of course,meant merely to suggest that the category ofwomen is a variable cultural accomplishment,a set of meanings that aretaken on or taken up within a cultural field,and that no one is born witha gender—gender is always acquired.On the other hand,Beauvoir waswilling to affirm that one is born with a sex,as a sex,sexed,and thatbeing sexed and being human are coextensive and simultaneous;sex isan analytic attribute of the human;there is no human who is not sexed;sex qualifies the human as a necessary attribute.But sex does not causegender,and gender cannot be understood to reflect or express sex;indeed,for Beauvoir,sex is immutably factic,but gender acquired,andwhereas sex cannot be changed—or so she thought—gender is thevariable cultural construction of sex,the myriad and open possibilitiesof cultural meaning occasioned by a sexed body.Beauvoir’s theory implied seemingly radical consequences,onesthat she herself did not entertain.For instance,if sex and gender areradically distinct,then it does not follow that to be a given sex is tobecome a given gender;in other words,“woman”need not be the cul-tural construction of the female body,and “man”need not interpretmale bodies.This radical formulation of the sex/gender distinctionsuggests that sexed bodies can be the occasion for a number of differ-

ent genders,and further,that gender itself need not be restricted tothe usual two.If sex does not limit gender,then perhaps there are gen-ders,ways of culturally interpreting the sexed body,that are in no wayrestricted by the apparent duality of sex.Consider the further conse-quence that if gender is something that one becomes—but can neverbe—then gender is itself a kind of becoming or activity,and that gen-der ought not to be conceived as a noun or a substantial thing or a stat-ic cultural marker,but rather as an incessant and repeated action ofsome sort.If gender is not tied to sex,either causally or expressively,then gender is a kind of action that can potentially proliferate beyondthe binary limits imposed by the apparent binary of sex.Indeed,gen-der would be a kind of cultural/corporeal action that requires a newvocabulary that institutes and proliferates present participles of vari-ous kinds,resignifiable and expansive categories that resist both thebinary and substantializing grammatical restrictions on gender.Buthow would such a project become culturally conceivable and avoid thefate of an impossible and vain utopian project?“One is not born a woman.”Monique Wittig echoed that phrase inan article by the same name,published in Feminist Issues(1:1).But whatsort of echo and re-presentation of Beauvoir does Monique Wittigoffer? Two of her claims both recall Beauvoir and set Wittig apart fromher:one,that the category of sex is neither invariant nor natural,but isa specifically political use of the category of nature that serves the pur-poses of reproductive sexuality.In other words,there is no reason todivide up human bodies into male and female sexes except that such adivision suits the economic needs of heterosexuality and lends a natu-ralistic gloss to the institution of heterosexuality.Hence,for Wittig,there is no distinction between sex and gender;the category of “sex”isitself a genderedcategory,fully politically invested,naturalized but notnatural.The second rather counter-intuitive claim that Wittig makes isthe following:a lesbian is not a woman.A woman,she argues,onlyexists as a term that stabilizes and consolidates a binary and opposi-tional relation to a man;that relation,she argues,is heterosexuality.A

lesbian,she claims,in refusing heterosexuality is no longer defined interms of that oppositional relation.Indeed,a lesbian,she maintains,transcends the binary opposition between woman and man;a lesbian isneither a woman nor a man.But further,a lesbian has no sex;she isbeyond the categories of sex.Through the lesbian refusal of those cate-gories,the lesbian exposes (pronouns are a problem here) the contin-gent cultural constitution of those categories and the tacit yet abidingpresumption of the heterosexual matrix.Hence,for Wittig,we mightsay,one is not born a woman,one becomes one;but further,one is notborn female,one becomes female;but even more radically,one can,ifone chooses,become neither female nor male,woman nor man.Indeed,the lesbian appears to be a third gender or,as I shall show,acategory that radically problematizes both sex and gender as stablepolitical categories of description.Wittig argues that the linguistic discrimination of “sex”secures thepolitical and cultural operation of compulsory heterosexuality.Thisrelationof heterosexuality,she argues,is neither reciprocal nor binaryin the usual sense;“sex”is always already female,and there is only onesex,the feminine.To be male is not to be “sexed”;to be “sexed”isalways a way of becoming particular and relative,and males within thissystem participate in the form of the universal person.For Wittig,then,the “female sex”does not imply some other sex,as in a “malesex”;the “female sex”implies only itself,enmeshed,as it were,in sex,trapped in what Beauvoir called the circle of immanence.Because“sex”is a political and cultural interpretation of the body,there is nosex/gender distinction along conventional lines;gender is built intosex,and sex proves to have been gender from the start.Wittig arguesthat within this set of compulsory social relations,women becomeontologically suffused with sex;they aretheir sex,and,conversely,sexis necessarily feminine.Wittig understands “sex”to be discursively produced and circulat-ed by a system of significations oppressive to women,gays,and les-bians.She refuses to take part in this signifying system or to believe in

the viability of taking up a reformist or subversive position within thesystem;to invoke a part of it is to invoke and confirm the entirety of it.As a result,the political task she formulates is to overthrow the entirediscourse on sex,indeed,to overthrow the very grammar that insti-tutes “gender”—or “fictive sex”—as an essential attribute of humansand objects alike (especially pronounced in French).25Through hertheory and fiction she calls for a radical reorganization of the descrip-tion of bodies and sexualities without recourse to sex and,conse-quently,without recourse to the pronomial differentiations thatregulate and distribute rights of speech within the matrix of gender.Wittig understands discursive categories like “sex”as abstractionsforcibly imposed upon the social field,ones that produce a second-order or reified “reality.”Although it appears that individuals have a“direct perception”of sex,taken as an objective datum of experience,Wittig argues that such an object has been violently shaped into such adatum and that the history and mechanism of that violent shaping nolonger appears with that object.26Hence,“sex”is the reality-effect of aviolent process that is concealed by that very effect.All that appears is“sex,”and so “sex”is perceived to be the totality of what is,uncaused,but only because the cause is nowhere to be seen.Wittig realizes thather position is counterintuitive,but the political cultivation of intu-ition is precisely what she wants to elucidate,expose,and challenge:Sex is taken as an “immediate given,”“a sensible given,”“physicalfeatures,”belonging to a natural order.But what we believe to be aphysical and direct perception is only a sophisticated and mythicconstruction,an “imaginary formation,”which reinterprets physi-cal features (in themselves as neutral as others but marked by a socialsystem),through the network of relationships in which they areperceived.27“Physical features”appear to be in some sense thereon the far sideof language,unmarked by a social system.It is unclear,however,thatthese features could be named in a way that would not reproduce the

reductive operation of the categories of sex.These numerous featuresgain social meaning and unification through their articulation withinthe category of sex.In other words,“sex”imposes an artificial unity onan otherwise discontinuous set of attributes.As both discursiveand per-ceptual,“sex”denotes an historically contingent epistemic regime,alanguage that forms perception by forcibly shaping the interrelation-ships through which physical bodies are perceived.Is there a “physical”body prior to the perceptually perceived body?An impossible question to decide.Not only is the gathering of attri-butes under the category of sex suspect,but so is the very discrimina-tion of the “features”themselves.That penis,vagina,breasts,and soforth,are namedsexual parts is both a restriction of the erogenousbody to those parts and a fragmentation of the body as a whole.Indeed,the “unity”imposed upon the body by the category of sex is a“disunity,”a fragmentation and compartmentalization,and a reductionof erotogeneity.No wonder,then,that Wittig textually enacts the“overthrow”of the category of sex through a destruction and fragmen-tation of the sexed body in The Lesbian Body.As “sex”fragments thebody,so the lesbian overthrow of “sex”targets as models of dominationthose sexually differentiated norms of bodily integrity that dictatewhat “unifies”and renders coherent the body as a sexed body.In hertheory and fiction,Wittig shows that the “integrity”and “unity”of thebody,often thought to be positive ideals,serve the purposes of frag-mentation,restriction,and domination.Language gains the power to create “the socially real”through thelocutionary acts of speaking subjects.There appear to be two levels ofreality,two orders of ontology,in Wittig’s theory.Socially constitutedontology emerges from a more fundamental ontology that appears tobe pre-social and pre-discursive.Whereas “sex”belongs to a discursive-ly constituted reality (second-order),there is a pre-social ontologythat accounts for the constitution of the discursive itself.She clearlyrefuses the structuralist assumption of a set of universal signifyingstructures prior to the speaking subject that orchestrate the formation

of that subject and his or her speech.In her view,there are historicallycontingent structures characterized as heterosexual and compulsorythat distribute the rights of full and authoritative speech to males anddeny them to females.But this socially constituted asymmetry disguis-es and violates a pre-social ontology of unified and equal persons.The task for women,Wittig argues,is to assume the position of theauthoritative,speaking subject—which is in some sense their ontolog-ically grounded “right”—and to overthrow both the category of sexand the system of compulsory heterosexuality that is its origin.Language,for Wittig,is a set of acts,repeated over time,that producereality-effects that are eventually misperceived as “facts.”Collectivelyconsidered,the repeated practice of naming sexual difference has cre-ated this appearance of natural division.The “naming”of sex is an act ofdomination and compulsion,an institutionalized performative thatboth creates and legislates social reality by requiring the discursive/perceptual construction of bodies in accord with principles of sexualdifference.Hence,Wittig concludes,“we are compelled in our bodiesand our minds to correspond,feature by feature,with the idea ofnature that has been established for us ...‘men’and ‘women’are polit-ical categories,and not natural facts.”28“Sex,”the category,compels “sex,”the social configuration of bod-ies,through what Wittig calls a coerced contract.Hence,the categoryof “sex”is a name that enslaves.Language “casts sheaves of reality uponthe social body,”but these sheaves are not easily discarded.She contin-ues:“stamping it and violently shaping it.”29Wittig argues that the“straight mind,”evident in the discourses of the human sciences,“oppress all of us,lesbians,women,and homosexual men”becausethey “take for granted that what founds society,any society,is hetero-sexuality.”30Discourse becomes oppressive when it requires that thespeaking subject,in order to speak,participate in the very terms ofthat oppression—that is,take for granted the speaking subject’s own impossibility or unintelligibility.This presumptive heterosexuali-ty,she argues,functions within discourse to communicate a threat:

“‘you-will-be-straight-or-you-will-not-be.’”31Women,lesbians,andgay men,she argues,cannot assume the position of the speaking sub-ject within the linguistic system of compulsory heterosexuality.Tospeak within the system is to be deprived of the possibility of speech;hence,to speak at all in that context is a performative contradiction,the linguistic assertion of a self that cannot “be”within the languagethat asserts it.The power Wittig accords to this “system”of language is enormous.Concepts,categories,and abstractions,she argues,can effect a physicaland material violence against the bodies they claim to organize andinterpret:“There is nothing abstract about the power that sciences andtheories have to act materially and actually upon our bodies and minds,even if the discourse that produces it is abstract.It is one of the formsof domination,its very expression,as Marx said.I would say,rather,one of its exercises.All of the oppressed know this power and have hadto deal with it.”32The power of language to work on bodies is both thecause of sexual oppression and the way beyond that oppression.Language works neither magically nor inexorably:“there is a plasticityof the real to language:language has a plastic action upon the real.”33Language assumes and alters its power to act upon the real throughlocutionary acts,which,repeated,become entrenched practices and,ultimately,institutions.The asymmetrical structure of language thatidentifies the subject who speaks for and as the universal with the maleand identifies the female speaker as “particular”and “interested”is in nosense intrinsic to particular languages or to language itself.These asym-metrical positions cannot be understood to follow from the “nature”ofmen or women,for,as Beauvoir established,no such “nature”exists:“One must understand that men are not born with a faculty for the uni-versal and that women are not reduced at birth to the particular.Theuniversal has been,and is continually,at every moment,appropriatedby men.It does not happen,it must be done.It is an act,a criminal act,perpetrated by one class against another.It is an act carried out at thelevel of concepts,philosophy,politics.”34

Although Irigaray argues that “the subject is always already mascu-line,”Wittig disputes the notion that “the subject”is exclusively mascu-line territory.The very plasticity of language,for her,resists the fixing ofthe subject position as masculine.Indeed,the presumption of anabsolute speaking subject is,for Wittig,the political goal for “women,”which,if achieved,will effectively dissolve the category of “women”altogether.A woman cannot use the first person “I”because as a woman,the speaker is “particular”(relative,interested,perspectival),and theinvocation of the “I”presumes the capacity to speak for and as the uni-versal human:“a relative subject is inconceivable,a relative subjectcould not speak at all.”35Relying on the assumption that all speakingpresupposes and implicitly invokes the entirety of language,Wittigdescribes the speaking subject as one who,in the act of saying “I,”“reap-propriates language as a whole,proceeding from oneself alone,with thepower to use all language.”This absolute grounding of the speaking “I”assumes god-like dimensions within Wittig’s discussion.This privilege tospeak “I”establishes a sovereign self,a center of absolute plenitude andpower;speaking establishes “the supreme act of subjectivity.”This com-ing into subjectivity is the effective overthrow of sex and,hence,thefeminine:“no woman can say I without being for herself a total sub-ject—that is,ungendered,universal,whole.”36Wittig continues with a startling speculation on the nature of lan-guage and “being”that situates her own political project within the tra-ditional discourse of ontotheology.In her view,the primary ontologyof language gives every person the same opportunity to establish sub-jectivity.The practical task that women face in trying to establish sub-jectivity through speech depends on their collective ability to cast offthe reifications of sex imposed on them which deform them as partialor relative beings.Since this discarding follows upon the exercise of afull invocation of “I,”women speaktheir way out of their gender.Thesocial reifications of sex can be understood to mask or distort a priorontological reality,that reality being the equal opportunity of all per-sons,prior to the marking by sex,to exercise language in the assertion

of subjectivity.In speaking,the “I”assumes the totality of language and,hence,speaks potentially from all positions—that is,in a universalmode.“Gender ...works upon this ontological fact to annul it,”shewrites,assuming the primary principle of equal access to the universalto qualify as that “ontological fact.”37This principle of equal access,however,is itself grounded in an ontological presumption of the unityof speaking beings in a Being that is prior to sexed being.Gender,sheargues,“tries to accomplish the division of Being,”but “Being as beingis not divided.”38Here the coherent assertion of the “I”presupposesnot only the totality of language,but the unity of being.If nowhere else quite so plainly,Wittig places herself here withinthe traditional discourse of the philosophical pursuit of presence,Being,radical and uninterrupted plenitude.In distinction from aDerridean position that would understand all signification to rely onan operational différance,Wittig argues that speaking requires andinvokes a seamless identity of all things.This foundationalist fictiongives her a point of departure by which to criticize existing social insti-tutions.The critical question remains,however,what contingent socialrelations does that presumption of being,authority,and universal sub-jecthood serve? Why value the usurpation of that authoritarian notionof the subject? Why not pursue the decentering of the subject and itsuniversalizing epistemic strategies? Although Wittig criticizes “thestraight mind”for universalizing its point of view,it appears that shenot only universalizes “the”straight mind,but fails to consider thetotalitarian consequences of such a theory of sovereign speech acts.Politically,the division of being—a violence against the field ofontological plenitude,in her view—into the distinction between theuniversal and the particular conditions a relation of subjection.Domination must be understood as the denial of a prior and primaryunity of all persons in a prelinguistic being.Domination occursthrough a language which,in its plastic social action,creates a second-order,artificial ontology,an illusion of difference,disparity,and,con-sequently,hierarchy that becomessocial reality.

Paradoxically,Wittig nowhere entertains an Aristophanic mythabout the original unity of genders,for gender is a divisive principle,atool of subjection,one that resists the very notion of unity.Significantly,her novels follow a narrative strategy of disintegration,suggesting that the binary formulation of sex needs to fragment andproliferate to the point where the binary itself is revealed as contin-gent.The free play of attributes or “physical features”is never anabsolute destruction,for the ontological field distorted by gender isone of continuous plenitude.Wittig criticizes “the straight mind”forbeing unable to liberate itself from the thought of “difference.”In tem-porary alliance with Deleuze and Guattarri,Wittig opposes psycho-analysis as a science predicated on an economy of “lack”and “negation.”In “Paradigm,”an early essay,Wittig considers that the overthrow ofthe system of binary sex might initiate a cultural field of manysexes.Inthat essay she refers to Anti-Oedipus:“For us there are,not one or twosexes,but many (cf.Guattarri/Deleuze),as many sexes as there areindividuals.”39The limitless proliferation of sexes,however,logicallyentails the negation of sex as such.If the number of sexes correspondsto the number of existing individuals,sex would no longer have anygeneral application as a term:one’s sex would be a radically singularproperty and would no longer be able to operate as a useful or descrip-tive generalization.The metaphors of destruction,overthrow,and violence that workin Wittig’s theory and fiction have a difficult ontological status.Although linguistic categories shape reality in a “violent”way,creatingsocial fictions in the name of the real,there appears to be a truer reali-ty,an ontological field of unity against which these social fictions aremeasured.Wittig refuses the distinction between an “abstract”conceptand a “material”reality,arguing that concepts are formed and circulat-ed within the materiality of language and that that language works in amaterialway to construct the social world.40On the other hand,these“constructions”are understood as distortions and reifications to bejudged against a prior ontological field of radical unity and plenitude.

Constructs are thus “real”to the extent that they are fictive phenomenathat gain power within discourse.These constructs are disempowered,however,through locutionary acts that implicitly seek recourse to theuniversality of language and the unity of Being.Wittig argues that “it isquite possible for a work of literature to operate as a war machine,”even “a perfect war machine.”41The main strategy of this war is forwomen,lesbians,and gay men—all of whom have been particularizedthrough an identification with “sex”—to preempt the position of thespeaking subject and its invocation of the universal point of view.The question of how a particular and relative subject can speak hisor her way out of the category of sex directs Wittig’s various considera-tions of Djuna Barnes,42Marcel Proust,43and Natalie Sarraute.44Theliterary text as war machine is,in each instance,directed against thehierarchical division of gender,the splitting of universal and particularin the name of a recovery of a prior and essential unity of those terms.To universalize the point of view of women is simultaneously to destroythe category of women and to establish the possibility of a new human-ism.Destruction is thus always restoration—that is,the destruction ofa set of categories that introduce artificial divisions into an otherwiseunified ontology.Literary works,however,maintain a privileged access to this pri-mary field of ontological abundance.The split between form and con-tent corresponds to the artificial philosophical distinction betweenabstract,universal thought and concrete,material reality.Just asWittig invokes Bakhtin to establish concepts as material realities,soshe invokes literary language more generally to reestablish the unity oflanguage as indissoluble form and content:“through literature ...words come back to us whole again”45;“language exists as a paradisemade of visible,audible,palpable,palatable words.”46Above all,liter-ary works offer Wittig the occasion to experiment with pronouns thatwithin systems of compulsory meaning conflate the masculine withthe universal and invariably particularize the feminine.In LesGuérillères,47she seeks to eliminate any he-they (il-ils) conjunctions,

indeed,any “he”(il),and to offer ellesas standing for the general,theuniversal.“The goal of this approach,”she writes,“is not to feminizethe world but to make the categories of sex obsolete in language.”48In a self-consciously defiant imperialist strategy,Wittig argues thatonly by taking up the universal and absolute point of view,effectivelylesbianizing the entire world,can the compulsory order of heterosexu-ality be destroyed.The j/eof The Lesbian Bodyis supposed to establishthe lesbian,not as a split subject,but as the sovereign subject who canwage war linguistically against a “world”that has constituted a semanticand syntactic assault against the lesbian.Her point is not to call atten-tion to the presence of rights of “women”or “lesbians”as individuals,but to counter the globalizing heterosexist episteme by a reverse dis-course of equal reach and power.The point is not to assume the positionof the speaking subject in order to be a recognized individual within aset of reciprocal linguistic relations;rather,the speaking subjectbecomes more than the individual,becomes an absolute perspectivethat imposes its categories on the entire linguistic field,known as “theworld.”Only a war strategy that rivals the proportions of compulsoryheterosexuality,Wittig argues,will operate effectively to challenge thelatter’s epistemic hegemony.In its ideal sense,speaking is,for Wittig,a potent act,an assertionof sovereignty that simultaneously implies a relationship of equalitywith other speaking subjects.49This ideal or primary “contract”of lan-guage operates at an implicit level.Language has a dual possibility:Itcan be used to assert a true and inclusive universality of persons,or itcan institute a hierarchy in which only some persons are eligible tospeak and others,by virtue of their exclusion from the universal pointof view,cannot “speak”without simultaneously deauthorizing thatspeech.Prior to this asymmetrical relation to speech,however,is anideal social contract,one in which every first-person speech act pre-supposes and affirms an absolute reciprocity among speaking sub-jects—Wittig’s version of the ideal speech situation.Distorting andconcealing that ideal reciprocity,however,is the heterosexual contract,

Subversive Bodily Acts

153




the focus of Wittig’s most recent theoretical work,50although presentin her theoretical essays all along.51Unspoken but always operative,the heterosexual contract cannotbe reduced to any of its empirical appearances.Wittig writes:I confront a nonexistent object,a fetish,an ideological form whichcannot be grasped in reality,except through its effects,whose exis-tence lies in the mind of people,but in a way that affects their wholelife,the way they act,the way they move,the way they think.So weare dealing with an object both imaginary and real.52As in Lacan,the idealization of heterosexuality appears even withinWittig’s own formulation to exercise a control over the bodies of prac-ticing heterosexuals that is finally impossible,indeed,that is bound tofalter on its own impossibility.Wittig appears to believe that only theradical departure from heterosexual contexts—namely becoming les-bian or gay—can bring about the downfall of this heterosexual regime.But this political consequence follows only if one understands all “par-ticipation”in heterosexuality to be a repetition and consolidation ofheterosexual oppression.The possibilities of resignifying heterosexual-ity itself are refused precisely because heterosexuality is understood asa total system that requires a thoroughgoing displacement.The politi-cal options that follow from such a totalizing view of heterosexistpower are (a) radical conformity or (b) radical revolution.Assuming the systemic integrity of heterosexuality is extremelyproblematic both for Wittig’s understanding of heterosexual practiceand for her conception of homosexuality and lesbianism.As radically“outside”the heterosexual matrix,homosexuality is conceived as radi-cally unconditioned by heterosexual norms.This purification of homo-sexuality,a kind of lesbian modernism,is currently contested bynumerous lesbian and gay discourses that understand lesbian and gayculture as embedded in the larger structures of heterosexuality even asthey are positioned in subversive or resignificatory relationships toheterosexual cultural configurations.Wittig’s view refuses the possibil-

ity,it seems,of a volitional or optional heterosexuality;yet,even ifheterosexuality is presented as obligatory or presumptive,it does notfollow that all heterosexual acts are radically determined.Further,Wittig’s radical disjunction between straight and gay replicates thekind of disjunctive binarism that she herself characterizes as the divi-sive philosophical gesture of the straight mind.My own conviction is that the radical disjunction posited by Wittigbetween heterosexuality and homosexuality is simply not true,thatthere are structures of psychic homosexuality within heterosexual rela-tions,and structures of psychic heterosexuality within gay and lesbiansexuality and relationships.Further,there are other power/discoursecenters that construct and structure both gay and straight sexuality;heterosexuality is not the only compulsory display of power thatinforms sexuality.The ideal of a coherent heterosexuality that Wittigdescribes as the norm and standard of the heterosexual contract is animpossible ideal,a “fetish,”as she herself points out.A psychoanalyticelaboration might contend that this impossibility is exposed in virtue ofthe complexity and resistance of an unconscious sexuality that is notalways already heterosexual.In this sense,heterosexuality offers nor-mative sexual positions that are intrinsically impossible to embody,andthe persistent failure to identify fully and without incoherence withthese positions reveals heterosexuality itself not only as a compulsorylaw,but as an inevitable comedy.Indeed,I would offer this insight intoheterosexuality as both a compulsory system and an intrinsic comedy,aconstant parody of itself,as an alternative gay/lesbian perspective.Clearly,the norm of compulsory heterosexuality does operatewith the force and violence that Wittig describes,but my own positionis that this is not the onlyway that it operates.For Wittig,the strategiesfor political resistance to normative heterosexuality are fairly direct.Only the array of embodied persons who are not engaged in a hetero-sexual relationship within the confines of the family which takes repro-duction to be the end or telos of sexuality are,in effect,activelycontesting the categories of sex or,at least,not in compliance with the

155




normative presuppositions and purposes of that set of categories.To belesbian or gay is,for Wittig,no longer to know one’s sex,to be engagedin a confusion and proliferation of categories that make sex an impossi-ble category of identity.As emancipatory as this sounds,Wittig’s pro-posal overrides those discourses within gay and lesbian culture thatproliferate specifically gay sexual identities by appropriating and rede-ploying the categories of sex.The terms queens,butches,femmes,girls,even the parodic reappropriation of dyke,queer,and fagredeploy anddestabilize the categories of sex and the originally derogatory cate-gories for homosexual identity.All of these terms might be understoodas symptomatic of “the straight mind,”modes of identifying with theoppressor’s version of the identity of the oppressed.On the otherhand,lesbianhas surely been partially reclaimed from it historicalmeanings,and parodic categories serve the purposes of denaturalizingsex itself.When the neighborhood gay restaurant closes for vacation,the owners put out a sign,explaining that “she’s overworked and needsa rest.”This very gay appropriation of the feminine works to multiplypossible sites of application of the term,to reveal the arbitrary relationbetween the signifier and the signified,and to destabilize and mobilizethe sign.Is this a colonizing “appropriation”of the feminine? My senseis no.That accusation assumes that the feminine belongs to women,anassumption surely suspect.Within lesbian contexts,the “identification”with masculinity thatappears as butch identity is not a simple assimilation of lesbianism backinto the terms of heterosexuality.As one lesbian femme explained,shelikes her boys to be girls,meaning that “being a girl”contextualizes andresignifies “masculinity”in a butch identity.As a result,that mascu-linity,if that it can be called,is always brought into relief against aculturally intelligible “female body.”It is precisely this dissonant juxta-position and the sexual tension that its transgression generates thatconstitute the object of desire.In other words,the object [and clearly,there is not just one] of lesbian-femme desire is neither some decon-textualized female body nor a discrete yet superimposed masculine

identity,but the destabilization of both terms as they come into eroticinterplay.Similarly,some heterosexual or bisexual women may wellprefer that the relation of “figure”to “ground”work in the oppositedirection—that is,they may prefer that their girls be boys.In that case,the perception of “feminine”identity would be juxtaposed on the“male body”as ground,but both terms would,through the juxtaposi-tion,lose their internal stability and distinctness from each other.Clearly,this way of thinking about gendered exchanges of desireadmits of much greater complexity,for the play of masculine and fem-inine,as well as the inversion of ground to figure can constitute a high-ly complex and structured production of desire.Significantly,both thesexed body as “ground”and the butch or femme identity as “figure”canshift,invert,and create erotic havoc of various sorts.Neither can layclaim to “the real,”although either can qualify as an object of belief,depending on the dynamic of the sexual exchange.The idea that butchand femme are in some sense “replicas”or “copies”of heterosexualexchange underestimates the erotic significance of these identities asinternally dissonant and complex in their resignification of the hege-monic categories by which they are enabled.Lesbian femmes mayrecall the heterosexual scene,as it were,but also displace it at the sametime.In both butch and femme identities,the very notion of an origi-nal or natural identity is put into question;indeed,it is precisely thatquestion as it is embodied in these identities that becomes one sourceof their erotic significance.Although Wittig does not discuss the meaning of butch/femmeidentities,her notion of fictive sex suggests a similar dissimulation of anatural or original notion of gendered coherence assumed to existamong sexed bodies,gender identities,and sexualities.Implicit inWittig’s description of sex as a fictive category is the notion that thevarious components of “sex”may well disaggregate.In such a break-down of bodily coherence,the category of sex could no longer operatedescriptively in any given cultural domain.If the category of “sex”isestablished through repeated acts,then conversely,the social action of

Subversive Bodily Acts

bodies within the cultural field can withdraw the very power of realitythat they themselves invested in the category.For power to be withdrawn,power itself would have to be under-stood as the retractable operation of volition;indeed,the heterosexualcontract would be understood to be sustained through a series ofchoices,just as the social contract in Locke or Rousseau is understoodto presuppose the rational choice or deliberate will of those it is said to govern.If power is not reduced to volition,however,and the classi-cal liberal and existential model of freedom is refused,then power-relations can be understood,as I think they ought to be,as constrainingand constituting the very possibilities of volition.Hence,power can beneither withdrawn nor refused,but only redeployed.Indeed,in myview,the normative focus for gay and lesbian practice ought to be onthe subversive and parodic redeployment of power rather than on theimpossible fantasy of its full-scale transcendence.Whereas Wittig clearly envisions lesbianism to be a full-scalerefusal of heterosexuality,I would argue that even that refusal consti-tutes an engagement and,ultimately,a radical dependence on the veryterms that lesbianism purports to transcend.If sexuality and power arecoextensive,and if lesbian sexuality is no more and no less constructedthan other modes of sexuality,then there is no promise of limitlesspleasure after the shackles of the category of sex have been thrown off.The structuring presence of heterosexual constructs within gay andlesbian sexuality does not mean that those constructs determinegay andlesbian sexuality nor that gay and lesbian sexuality are derivable orreducible to those constructs.Indeed,consider the disempowering anddenaturalizing effects of a specifically gay deployment of heterosexualconstructs.The presence of these norms not only constitute a site ofpower that cannot be refused,but they can and do become the site ofparodic contest and display that robs compulsory heterosexuality of itsclaims to naturalness and originality.Wittig calls for a position beyondsex that returns her theory to a problematic humanism based in aproblematic metaphysics of presence.And yet,her literary works

Gender Trouble

158




appear to enact a different kind of political strategy than the one forwhich she explicitly calls in her theoretical essays.In The Lesbian Bodyand in Les Guérillères,the narrative strategy through which politicaltransformation is articulated makes use of redeployment and transval-uation time and again both to make use of originally oppressive termsand to deprive them of their legitimating functions.Although Wittig herself is a “materialist,”the term has a specificmeaning within her theoretical framework.She wants to overcome the split between materiality and representation that characterizes“straight”thinking.Materialism implies neither a reduction of ideas to matter nor the view of theory as a reflection of its economic base,strictly conceived.Wittig’s materialism takes social institutions and prac-tices,in particular,the institution of heterosexuality,as the basis of criti-cal analysis.In “The Straight Mind”and “On the Social Contract,”53sheunderstands the institution of heterosexuality as the founding basis of themale-dominated social orders.“Nature”and the domain of materialityare ideas,ideological constructs,produced by these social institutions tosupport the political interests of the heterosexual contract.In this sense,Wittig is a classic idealist for whom nature is understood as a mental rep-resentation.A language of compulsory meanings produces this represen-tation of nature to further the political strategy of sexual domination andto rationalize the institution of compulsory heterosexuality.Unlike Beauvoir,Wittig sees nature not as a resistant materiality,amedium,surface,or an object;it is an “idea”generated and sustainedfor the purposes of social control.The very elasticity of the ostensiblemateriality of the body is shown in The Lesbian Bodyas language figuresand refigures the parts of the body into radically new social configura-tions of form (and antiform).Like those mundane and scientific lan-guages that circulate the idea of “nature”and so produce thenaturalized conception of discretely sexed bodies,Wittig’s own lan-guage enacts an alternative disfiguring and refiguring of bodies.Heraim is to expose the idea of a natural body as a construction and tooffer a deconstructive/reconstructive set of strategies for configuring

Subversive Bodily Acts

159




bodies to contest the power of heterosexuality.The very shape andform of bodies,their unifying principle,their composite parts,arealways figured by a language imbued with political interests.ForWittig,the political challenge is to seize languageas the means of rep-resentation andproduction,to treat it as an instrument that invariablyconstructs the field of bodies and that ought to be used to deconstructand reconstruct bodies outside the oppressive categories of sex.If the multiplication of gender possibilities expose and disrupt thebinary reifications of gender,what is the nature of such a subversiveenactment? How can such an enactment constitute a subversion? InThe Lesbian Body,the act of love-making literally tears the bodies of itspartners apart.As lesbiansexuality,this set of acts outside of the repro-ductive matrix produces the body itself as an incoherent center ofattributes,gestures,and desires.And in Wittig’s Les Guérillères,thesame kind of disintegrating effect,even violence,emerges in the strug-gle between the “women”and their oppressors.In that context,Wittigclearly distances herself from those who would defend the notion of a“specifically feminine”pleasure,writing,or identity;she all but mocksthose who would hold up the “circle”as their emblem.For Wittig,thetask is not to prefer the feminine side of the binary to the masculine,but to displace the binary as such through a specifically lesbian disinte-gration of its constitutive categories.The disintegration appears literal in the fictional text,as does theviolent struggle in Les Guérillères.Wittig’s texts have been criticized forthis use of violence and force—notions that on the surface seem anti-thetical to feminist aims.But note that Wittig’s narrative strategy is notto identify the feminine through a strategy of differentiation or exclu-sion from the masculine.Such a strategy consolidates hierarchy andbinarisms through a transvaluation of values by which women nowrepresent the domain of positive value.In contrast to a strategy thatconsolidates women’s identity through an exclusionary process of dif-ferentiation,Wittig offers a strategy of reappropriation and subversiveredeployment of precisely those “values”that originally appeared to

belong to the masculine domain.One might well object that Wittig hasassimilated masculine values or,indeed,that she is “male-identified,”but the very notion of “identification”reemerges in the context of thisliterary production as immeasurably more complex than the uncriticaluse of that term suggests.The violence and struggle in her text is,sig-nificantly,recontextualized,no longer sustaining the same meaningsthat it has in oppressive contexts.It is neither a simple “turning of thetables”in which women now wage violence against men,nor a simpleinternalizationof masculine norms such that women now wage violenceagainst themselves.The violence of the text has the identity and coher-ence of the category of sex as its target,a lifeless construct,a constructout to deaden the body.Because that category is the naturalized con-struct that makes the institution of normative heterosexuality seeminevitable,Wittig’s textual violence is enacted against that institution,and not primarily for its heterosexuality,but for its compulsoriness.Note as well that the category of sex and the naturalized institutionof heterosexuality are constructs,socially instituted and socially regulat-ed fantasies or “fetishes,”not naturalcategories,but politicalones (cate-gories that prove that recourse to the “natural”in such contexts isalways political).Hence,the body which is torn apart,the wars wagedamong women,are textualviolences,the deconstruction of constructsthat are always already a kind of violence against the body’s possibilities.But here we might ask:What is left when the body rendered coher-ent through the category of sex is disaggregated,rendered chaotic? Canthis body be re-membered,be put back together again? Are there possi-bilities of agency that do not require the coherent reassembling of this construct? Wittig’s text not only deconstructs sex and offers a way to disintegrate the false unity designated by sex,but enacts as wella kind of diffuse corporeal agency generated from a number of differentcenters of power.Indeed,the source of personal and political agencycomes not from within the individual,but in and through the com-plex cultural exchanges among bodies in which identity itself is ever-shifting,indeed,where identity itself is constructed,disintegrated,and

recirculated only within the context of a dynamic field of cultural rela-tions.To bea woman is,then,for Wittig as well as for Beauvoir,tobecomea woman,but because this process is in no sense fixed,it is pos-sible to become a being whom neither mannor womantruly describes.This is not the figure of the androgyne nor some hypothetical “thirdgender,”nor is it a transcendenceof the binary.Instead,it is an internalsubversion in which the binary is both presupposed and proliferated tothe point where it no longer makes sense.The force of Wittig’s fiction,its linguistic challenge,is to offer an experience beyond the categoriesof identity,an erotic struggle to create new categories from the ruins ofthe old,new ways of being a body within the cultural field,and wholenew languages of description.In response to Beauvoir’s notion “one is not born a woman,but,rather,becomes one,”Wittig claims that instead of becoming a woman,one (anyone?) can become a lesbian.By refusing the category ofwomen,Wittig’s lesbian-feminism appears to cut off any kind of soli-darity with heterosexual women and implicitly to assume that lesbian-ism is the logically or politically necessary consequence of feminism.This kind of separatist prescriptivism is surely no longer viable.Buteven if it were politically desirable,what criteria would be used todecide the question of sexual “identity”?If to become a lesbian is an act,a leave-taking of heterosexuality,aself-naming that contests the compulsory meanings of heterosexuali-ty’s womenand men,what is to keep the name of lesbian from becomingan equally compulsory category? What qualifies as a lesbian? Does any-one know? If a lesbian refutes the radical disjunction between hetero-sexual and homosexual economies that Wittig promotes,is that lesbianno longer a lesbian? And if it is an “act”that founds the identity as a per-formative accomplishment of sexuality,are there certain kinds of actsthat qualify over others as foundational? Can one do the act with a“straight mind”? Can one understand lesbian sexuality not only as acontestation of the category of “sex,”of “women,”of “natural bodies,”but also of “lesbian”?

Interestingly,Wittig suggests a necessary relationship between thehomosexual point of view and that of figurative language,as if to be ahomosexual is to contest the compulsory syntax and semantics thatconstruct “the real.”Excluded from the real,the homosexual point ofview,if there is one,might well understand the real as constitutedthrough a set of exclusions,margins that do not appear,absences thatdo not figure.What a tragic mistake,then,to construct a gay/lesbianidentity through the same exclusionary means,as if the excluded werenot,precisely through its exclusion,always presupposed and,indeed,requiredfor the construction of that identity.Such an exclusion,para-doxically,institutes precisely the relation of radical dependency itseeks to overcome:Lesbianism would then requireheterosexuality.Lesbianism that defines itself in radical exclusion from heterosexualitydeprives itself of the capacity to resignify the very heterosexual con-structs by which it is partially and inevitably constituted.As a result,that lesbian strategy would consolidate compulsory heterosexuality inits oppressive forms.The more insidious and effective strategy it seems is a thoroughgo-ing appropriation and redeployment of the categories of identitythemselves,not merely to contest “sex,”but to articulate the conver-gence of multiple sexual discourses at the site of “identity”in order torender that category,in whatever form,permanently problematic.iv.Bodily Inscriptions,Performative Subversions“Garbo ‘got in drag’whenever she took some heavy glamour part,when-ever she melted in or out of a man’s arms,whenever she simply let thatheavenly-flexed neck ...bear the weight of her thrown-back head....How resplendent seems the art of acting!

theory and politics.These constructs of identity serve as the points ofepistemic departure from which theory emerges and politics itself isshaped.In the case of feminism,politics is ostensibly shaped to expressthe interests,the perspectives,of “women.”But is there a politicalshape to “women,”as it were,that precedes and prefigures the politicalelaboration of their interests and epistemic point of view? How is thatidentity shaped,and is it a political shaping that takes the very mor-phology and boundary of the sexed body as the ground,surface,or siteof cultural inscription? What circumscribes that site as “the femalebody”? Is “the body”or “the sexed body”the firm foundation on whichgender and systems of compulsory sexuality operate? Or is “the body”itself shaped by political forces with strategic interests in keeping thatbody bounded and constituted by the markers of sex?The sex/gender distinction and the category of sex itself appear topresuppose a generalization of “the body”that preexists the acquisitionof its sexed significance.This “body”often appears to be a passivemedium that is signified by an inscription from a cultural source fig-ured as “external”to that body.Any theory of the culturally construct-ed body,however,ought to question “the body”as a construct ofsuspect generality when it is figured as passive and prior to discourse.There are Christian and Cartesian precedents to such views which,prior to the emergence of vitalistic biologies in the nineteenth century,understand “the body”as so much inert matter,signifying nothing or,more specifically,signifying a profane void,the fallen state:deception,sin,the premonitional metaphorics of hell and the eternal feminine.There are many occasions in both Sartre’s and Beauvoir’s work where“the body”is figured as a mute facticity,anticipating some meaning thatcan be attributed only by a transcendent consciousness,understood inCartesian terms as radically immaterial.But what establishes this dual-ism for us? What separates off “the body”as indifferent to signification,and signification itself as the act of a radically disembodied conscious-ness or,rather,the act that radically disembodies that consciousness? Towhat extent is that Cartesian dualism presupposed in phenomenology

adapted to the structuralist frame in which mind/body is redescribedas culture/nature? With respect to gender discourse,to what extentdo these problematic dualisms still operate within the very descrip-tions that are supposed to lead us out of that binarism and its implicithierarchy? How are the contours of the body clearly marked as thetaken-for-granted ground or surface upon which gender significationsare inscribed,a mere facticity devoid of value,prior to significance?Wittig suggests that a culturally specific epistemic a priori estab-lishes the naturalness of “sex.”But by what enigmatic means has “thebody”been accepted as a prima faciegiven that admits of no genealogy?Even within Foucault’s essay on the very theme of genealogy,the bodyis figured as a surface and the scene of a cultural inscription:“the bodyis the inscribed surface of events.”54The task of genealogy,he claims,is“to expose a body totally imprinted by history.”His sentence contin-ues,however,by referring to the goal of “history”—here clearlyunderstood on the model of Freud’s “civilization”—as the “destructionof the body”(148).Forces and impulses with multiple directionalitiesare precisely that which history both destroys and preserves throughthe Entstehung(historical event) of inscription.As “a volume in perpet-ual disintegration”(148),the body is always under siege,sufferingdestruction by the very terms of history.And history is the creation ofvalues and meanings by a signifying practice that requires the subjec-tion of the body.This corporeal destruction is necessary to produce thespeaking subject and its significations.This is a body,described throughthe language of surface and force,weakened through a “single drama”of domination,inscription,and creation (150).This is not the modusvivendiof one kind of history rather than another,but is,for Foucault,“history”(148) in its essential and repressive gesture.Although Foucault writes,“Nothing in man [sic]—not even hisbody—is sufficiently stable to serve as the basis for self-recognition orfor understanding other men [sic]”(153),he nevertheless points to theconstancy of cultural inscription as a “single drama”that acts on thebody.If the creation of values,that historical mode of signification,

Subversive Bodily Acts

requires the destruction of the body,much as the instrument of tor-ture in Kafka’s “In the Penal Colony”destroys the body on which itwrites,then there must be a body prior to that inscription,stable andself-identical,subject to that sacrificial destruction.In a sense,forFoucault,as for Nietzsche,cultural values emerge as the result of aninscription on the body,understood as a medium,indeed,a blankpage;in order for this inscription to signify,however,that mediummust itself be destroyed—that is,fully transvaluated into a sublimateddomain of values.Within the metaphorics of this notion of cultural val-ues is the figure of history as a relentless writing instrument,and thebody as the medium which must be destroyed and transfigured inorder for “culture”to emerge.By maintaining a body prior to its cultural inscription,Foucaultappears to assume a materiality prior to signification and form.Becausethis distinction operates as essential to the task of genealogy as hedefines it,the distinction itself is precluded as an object of genealogicalinvestigation.Occasionally in his analysis of Herculine,Foucault sub-scribes to a prediscursive multiplicity of bodily forces that breakthrough the surface of the body to disrupt the regulating practices ofcultural coherence imposed upon that body by a power regime,under-stood as a vicissitude of “history.”If the presumption of some kind ofprecategorial source of disruption is refused,is it still possible to give agenealogical account of the demarcation of the body as such as a signify-ing practice? This demarcation is not initiated by a reified history or by asubject.This marking is the result of a diffuse and active structuring ofthe social field.This signifying practice effects a social space for and ofthe body within certain regulatory grids of intelligibility.Mary Douglas’s Purity and Dangersuggests that the very contoursof “the body”are established through markings that seek to establishspecific codes of cultural coherence.Any discourse that establishes theboundaries of the body serves the purpose of instating and naturalizingcertain taboos regarding the appropriate limits,postures,and modesof exchange that define what it is that constitutes bodies:

ideas about separating,purifying,demarcating and punishing trans-gressions have as their main function to impose system on an inher-ently untidy experience.It is only by exaggerating the differencebetween within and without,above and below,male and female,withand against,that a semblance of order is created.55Although Douglas clearly subscribes to a structuralist distinctionbetween an inherently unruly nature and an order imposed by culturalmeans,the “untidiness”to which she refers can be redescribed as aregion of culturalunruliness and disorder.Assuming the inevitablybinary structure of the nature/culture distinction,Douglas cannotpoint toward an alternative configuration of culture in which such dis-tinctions become malleable or proliferate beyond the binary frame.Her analysis,however,provides a possible point of departure forunderstanding the relationship by which social taboos institute andmaintain the boundaries of the body as such.Her analysis suggests thatwhat constitutes the limit of the body is never merely material,butthat the surface,the skin,is systemically signified by taboos and antici-pated transgressions;indeed,the boundaries of the body become,within her analysis,the limits of the social per se.A poststructuralistappropriation of her view might well understand the boundaries of thebody as the limits of the socially hegemonic.In a variety of cultures,shemaintains,there arepollution powers which inhere in the structure of ideas itself andwhich punish a symbolic breaking of that which should be joined orjoining of that which should be separate.It follows from this that pol-lution is a type of danger which is not likely to occur except wherethe lines of structure,cosmic or social,are clearly defined.A polluting person is always in the wrong.He [sic] has developedsome wrong condition or simply crossed over some line whichshould not have been crossed and this displacement unleashes dangerfor someone.56

In a sense,Simon Watney has identified the contemporary con-struction of “the polluting person”as the person with AIDS in hisPolicing Desire:AIDS,Pornography,and the Media.57Not only is the illnessfigured as the “gay disease,”but throughout the media’s hysterical andhomophobic response to the illness there is a tactical construction of acontinuity between the polluted status of the homosexual by virtue ofthe boundary-trespass that is homosexuality and the disease as a specif-ic modality of homosexual pollution.That the disease is transmittedthrough the exchange of bodily fluids suggests within the sensationalistgraphics of homophobic signifying systems the dangers that permeablebodily boundaries present to the social order as such.Douglas remarksthat “the body is a model that can stand for any bounded system.Itsboundaries can represent any boundaries which are threatened or pre-carious.”58And she asks a question which one might have expected toread in Foucault:“Why should bodily margins be thought to be specifi-cally invested with power and danger?”59Douglas suggests that all social systems are vulnerable at theirmargins,and that all margins are accordingly considered dangerous.If the body is synecdochal for the social system per seor a site in whichopen systems converge,then any kind of unregulated permeabil-ity constitutes a site of pollution and endangerment.Since anal andoral sex among men clearly establishes certain kinds of bodily per-meabilities unsanctioned by the hegemonic order,male homosex-uality would,within such a hegemonic point of view,constitute a site of danger and pollution,prior to and regardless of the culturalpresence of AIDS.Similarly,the “polluted”status of lesbians,regardlessof their low-risk status with respect to AIDS,brings into relief the dangers of their bodily exchanges.Significantly,being “outside”the hegemonic order does not signify being “in”a state of filthy and untidy nature.Paradoxically,homosexuality is almost alwaysconceived within the homophobic signifying economy as bothuncivi-lized and unnatural.

The construction of stable bodily contours relies upon fixed sitesof corporeal permeability and impermeability.Those sexual practicesin both homosexual and heterosexual contexts that open surfaces andorifices to erotic signification or close down others effectively rein-scribe the boundaries of the body along new cultural lines.Anal sexamong men is an example,as is the radical re-membering of the bodyin Wittig’s The Lesbian Body.Douglas alludes to “a kind of sex pollutionwhich expresses a desire to keep the body (physical and social)intact,”60suggesting that the naturalized notion of “the”body is itself aconsequence of taboos that render that body discrete by virtue of itsstable boundaries.Further,the rites of passage that govern variousbodily orifices presuppose a heterosexual construction of genderedexchange,positions,and erotic possibilities.The deregulation of suchexchanges accordingly disrupts the very boundaries that determinewhat it is to be a body at all.Indeed,the critical inquiry that traces theregulatory practices within which bodily contours are constructedconstitutes precisely the genealogy of “the body”in its discreteness thatmight further radicalize Foucault’s theory.61Significantly,Kristeva’s discussion of abjection in Powers of Horrorbegins to suggest the uses of this structuralist notion of a boundary-constituting taboo for the purposes of constructing a discrete subjectthrough exclusion.62The “abject”designates that which has beenexpelled from the body,discharged as excrement,literally rendered“Other.”This appears as an expulsion of alien elements,but the alien iseffectively established through this expulsion.The construction of the“not-me”as the abject establishes the boundaries of the body whichare also the first contours of the subject.Kristeva writes:nauseamakes me balk at that milk cream,separates me from themother and father who proffer it.“I”want none of that element,signof their desire;“I”do not want to listen,“I”do not assimilate it,“I”expel it.But since the food is not an “other”for “me,”who am only in

their desire,I expel myself,I spit myselfout,I abject myselfwithin thesame motion through which “I”claim to establish myself.63The boundary of the body as well as the distinction between inter-nal and external is established through the ejection and transvaluationof something originally part of identity into a defiling otherness.AsIris Young has suggested in her use of Kristeva to understand sexism,homophobia,and racism,the repudiation of bodies for their sex,sexu-ality,and/or color is an “expulsion”followed by a “repulsion”thatfounds and consolidates culturally hegemonic identities alongsex/race/sexuality axes of differentiation.64Young’s appropriation ofKristeva shows how the operation of repulsion can consolidate “identi-ties”founded on the instituting of the “Other”or a set of Othersthrough exclusion and domination.What constitutes through divisionthe “inner”and “outer”worlds of the subject is a border and boundarytenuously maintained for the purposes of social regulation and con-trol.The boundary between the inner and outer is confounded bythose excremental passages in which the inner effectively becomesouter,and this excreting function becomes,as it were,the model bywhich other forms of identity-differentiation are accomplished.Ineffect,this is the mode by which Others become shit.For inner andouter worlds to remain utterly distinct,the entire surface of the bodywould have to achieve an impossible impermeability.This sealing of itssurfaces would constitute the seamless boundary of the subject;butthis enclosure would invariably be exploded by precisely that excre-mental filth that it fears.Regardless of the compelling metaphors of the spatial distinctionsof inner and outer,they remain linguistic terms that facilitate and artic-ulate a set of fantasies,feared and desired.“Inner”and “outer”makesense only with reference to a mediating boundary that strives for sta-bility.And this stability,this coherence,is determined in large part bycultural orders that sanction the subject and compel its differentiationfrom the abject.Hence,“inner”and “outer”constitute a binary distinc-

tion that stabilizes and consolidates the coherent subject.When thatsubject is challenged,the meaning and necessity of the terms are sub-ject to displacement.If the “inner world”no longer designates a topos,then the internal fixity of the self and,indeed,the internal locale ofgender identity,become similarly suspect.The critical question is nothowdid that identity become internalized? as if internalization were aprocess or a mechanism that might be descriptively reconstructed.Rather,the question is:From what strategic position in public discourseand for what reasons has the trope of interiority and the disjunctivebinary of inner/outer taken hold? In what language is “inner space”fig-ured? What kind of figuration is it,and through what figure of the bodyis it signified? How does a body figure on its surface the very invisibilityof its hidden depth?From Interiority to Gender PerformativesIn Discipline and PunishFoucault challenges the language of internaliza-tion as it operates in the service of the disciplinary regime of the sub-jection and subjectivation of criminals.65Although Foucault objectedto what he understood to be the psychoanalytic belief in the “inner”truth of sex in The History of Sexuality,he turns to a criticism of thedoctrine of internalization for separate purposes in the context of hishistory of criminology.In a sense,Discipline and Punishcan be read asFoucault’s effort to rewrite Nietzsche’s doctrine of internalization inOn the Genealogy of Moralson the model of inscription.In the context ofprisoners,Foucault writes,the strategy has been not to enforce arepression of their desires,but to compel their bodies to signify theprohibitive law as their very essence,style,and necessity.That law isnot literally internalized,but incorporated,with the consequence thatbodies are produced which signify that law on and through the body;there the law is manifest as the essence of their selves,the meaning oftheir soul,their conscience,the law of their desire.In effect,the law isat once fully manifest and fully latent,for it never appears as externalto the bodies it subjects and subjectivates.Foucault writes:

It would be wrong to say that the soul is an illusion,or an ideologicaleffect.On the contrary,it exists,it has a reality,it is produced per-manently around,on,within,the body by the functioning of a powerthat is exercised on those that are punished.(my emphasis)66The figure of the interior soul understood as “within”the body is signi-fied through its inscription onthe body,even though its primary modeof signification is through its very absence,its potent invisibility.Theeffect of a structuring inner space is produced through the significationof a body as a vital and sacred enclosure.The soul is precisely what thebody lacks;hence,the body presents itself as a signifying lack.Thatlack which isthe body signifies the soul as that which cannot show.Inthis sense,then,the soul is a surface signification that contests and dis-places the inner/outer distinction itself,a figure of interior psychicspace inscribed onthe body as a social signification that perpetuallyrenounces itself as such.In Foucault’s terms,the soul is not impris-oned by or within the body,as some Christian imagery would suggest,but “the soul is the prison of the body.”67The redescription of intrapsychic processes in terms of the surfacepolitics of the body implies a corollary redescription of gender as thedisciplinary production of the figures of fantasy through the play ofpresence and absence on the body’s surface,the construction of thegendered body through a series of exclusions and denials,signifyingabsences.But what determines the manifest and latent text of the bodypolitic? What is the prohibitive law that generates the corporeal styliza-tion of gender,the fantasied and fantastic figuration of the body? Wehave already considered the incest taboo and the prior taboo againsthomosexuality as the generative moments of gender identity,the pro-hibitions that produce identity along the culturally intelligible grids ofan idealized and compulsory heterosexuality.That disciplinary produc-tion of gender effects a false stabilization of gender in the interests ofthe heterosexual construction and regulation of sexuality within thereproductive domain.The construction of coherence conceals the gen-

der discontinuities that run rampant within heterosexual,bisexual,and gay and lesbian contexts in which gender does not necessarily fol-low from sex,and desire,or sexuality generally,does not seem to fol-low from gender—indeed,where none of these dimensions ofsignificant corporeality express or reflect one another.When the disor-ganization and disaggregation of the field of bodies disrupt the regula-tory fiction of heterosexual coherence,it seems that the expressivemodel loses its descriptive force.That regulatory ideal is then exposedas a norm and a fiction that disguises itself as a developmental law reg-ulating the sexual field that it purports to describe.According to the understanding of identification as an enacted fan-tasy or incorporation,however,it is clear that coherence is desired,wished for,idealized,and that this idealization is an effect of a corpore-al signification.In other words,acts,gestures,and desire produce theeffect of an internal core or substance,but produce this on the surfaceofthe body,through the play of signifying absences that suggest,butnever reveal,the organizing principle of identity as a cause.Such acts,gestures,enactments,generally construed,are performativein the sensethat the essence or identity that they otherwise purport to express arefabricationsmanufactured and sustained through corporeal signs andother discursive means.That the gendered body is performative sug-gests that it has no ontological status apart from the various acts whichconstitute its reality.This also suggests that if that reality is fabricatedas an interior essence,that very interiority is an effect and function of a decidedly public and social discourse,the public regulation of fan-tasy through the surface politics of the body,the gender border controlthat differentiates inner from outer,and so institutes the “integrity”of the subject.In other words,acts and gestures,articulated and enact-ed desires create the illusion of an interior and organizing gender core,an illusion discursively maintained for the purposes of the regulationof sexuality within the obligatory frame of reproductive heterosex-uality.If the “cause”of desire,gesture,and act can be localized withinthe “self”of the actor,then the political regulations and disciplinary

practices which produce that ostensibly coherent gender are effective-ly displaced from view.The displacement of a political and discursiveorigin of gender identity onto a psychological “core”precludes ananalysis of the political constitution of the gendered subject and itsfabricated notions about the ineffable interiority of its sex or of its true identity.If the inner truth of gender is a fabrication and if a true gender is afantasy instituted and inscribed on the surface of bodies,then it seemsthat genders can be neither true nor false,but are only produced as thetruth effects of a discourse of primary and stable identity.In MotherCamp:Female Impersonators in America,anthropologist Esther Newtonsuggests that the structure of impersonation reveals one of the key fab-ricating mechanisms through which the social construction of gendertakes place.68I would suggest as well that drag fully subverts the dis-tinction between inner and outer psychic space and effectively mocksboth the expressive model of gender and the notion of a true genderidentity.Newton writes:At its most complex,[drag] is a double inversion that says,“appear-ance is an illusion.”Drag says [Newton’s curious personification] “my‘outside’appearance is feminine,but my essence ‘inside’[the body] ismasculine.”At the same time it symbolizes the opposite inversion;“my appearance ‘outside’[my body,my gender] is masculine but myessence ‘inside’[myself] is feminine.”69Both claims to truth contradict one another and so displace the en-tire enactment of gender significations from the discourse of truth and falsity.The notion of an original or primary gender identity is often paro-died within the cultural practices of drag,cross-dressing,and the sexu-al stylization of butch/femme identities.Within feminist theory,suchparodic identities have been understood to be either degrading towomen,in the case of drag and cross-dressing,or an uncritical appro-priation of sex-role stereotyping from within the practice of hetero-

sexuality,especially in the case of butch/femme lesbian identities.Butthe relation between the “imitation”and the “original”is,I think,morecomplicated than that critique generally allows.Moreover,it gives us aclue to the way in which the relationship between primary identifica-tion—that is,the original meanings accorded to gender—and subse-quent gender experience might be reframed.The performance of dragplays upon the distinction between the anatomy of the performer andthe gender that is being performed.But we are actually in the presenceof three contingent dimensions of significant corporeality:anatomicalsex,gender identity,and gender performance.If the anatomy of theperformer is already distinct from the gender of the performer,andboth of those are distinct from the gender of the performance,then theperformance suggests a dissonance not only between sex and perfor-mance,but sex and gender,and gender and performance.As much asdrag creates a unified picture of “woman”(what its critics often oppose),it also reveals the distinctness of those aspects of gendered experiencewhich are falsely naturalized as a unity through the regulatory fiction ofheterosexual coherence.In imitating gender,drag implicitly reveals the imita-tive structure of gender itself—as well as its contingency.Indeed,part of thepleasure,the giddiness of the performance is in the recognition of a radi-cal contingency in the relation between sex and gender in the face of cul-tural configurations of causal unities that are regularly assumed to benatural and necessary.In the place of the law of heterosexual coherence,we see sex and gender denaturalized by means of a performance whichavows their distinctness and dramatizes the cultural mechanism of theirfabricated unity.The notion of gender parody defended here does not assume thatthere is an original which such parodic identities imitate.Indeed,theparody is ofthe very notion of an original;just as the psychoanalyticnotion of gender identification is constituted by a fantasy of a fantasy,the transfiguration of an Other who is always already a “figure”in thatdouble sense,so gender parody reveals that the original identity afterwhich gender fashions itself is an imitation without an origin.To be

more precise,it is a production which,in effect—that is,in itseffect—postures as an imitation.This perpetual displacement consti-tutes a fluidity of identities that suggests an openness to resignificationand recontextualization;parodic proliferation deprives hegemonic cul-ture and its critics of the claim to naturalized or essentialist genderidentities.Although the gender meanings taken up in these parodicstyles are clearly part of hegemonic,misogynist culture,they are nev-ertheless denaturalized and mobilized through their parodic recontex-tualization.As imitations which effectively displace the meaning of theoriginal,they imitate the myth of originality itself.In the place of anoriginal identification which serves as a determining cause,genderidentity might be reconceived as a personal/cultural history ofreceived meanings subject to a set of imitative practices which referlaterally to other imitations and which,jointly,construct the illusion ofa primary and interior gendered self or parody the mechanism of thatconstruction.According to Fredric Jameson’s “Postmodernism and ConsumerSociety,”the imitation that mocks the notion of an original is charac-teristic of pastiche rather than parody:Pastiche is,like parody,the imitation of a peculiar or unique style,thewearing of a stylistic mask,speech in a dead language:but it is a neutralpractice of mimicry,without parody’s ulterior motive,without thesatirical impulse,without laughter,without that still latent feeling thatthere exists something normalcompared to which what is being imitat-ed is rather comic.Pastiche is blank parody,parody that has lost ithumor.70The loss of the sense of “the normal,”however,can be its own occasionfor laughter,especially when “the normal,”“the original”is revealed tobe a copy,and an inevitably failed one,an ideal that no one canembody.In this sense,laughter emerges in the realization that all along the orig-inal was derived.Parody by itself is not subversive,and there must be a way to under-

stand what makes certain kinds of parodic repetitions effectively dis-ruptive,truly troubling,and which repetitions become domesticatedand recirculated as instruments of cultural hegemony.A typology ofactions would clearly not suffice,for parodic displacement,indeed,par-odic laughter,depends on a context and reception in which subversiveconfusions can be fostered.What performance where will invert theinner/outer distinction and compel a radical rethinking of the psycho-logical presuppositions of gender identity and sexuality? What perfor-mance where will compel a reconsideration of the placeand stability ofthe masculine and the feminine? And what kind of gender performancewill enact and reveal the performativity of gender itself in a way thatdestabilizes the naturalized categories of identity and desire.If the body is not a “being,”but a variable boundary,a surface whosepermeability is politically regulated,a signifying practice within a cul-tural field of gender hierarchy and compulsory heterosexuality,thenwhat language is left for understanding this corporeal enactment,gen-der,that constitutes its “interior”signification on its surface? Sartrewould perhaps have called this act “a style of being,”Foucault,“a stylis-tics of existence.”And in my earlier reading of Beauvoir,I suggest that gendered bodies are so many “styles of the flesh.”These styles allnever fully self-styled,for styles have a history,and those histories con-dition and limit the possibilities.Consider gender,for instance,as acorporeal style,an “act,”as it were,which is both intentional and per-formative,where “performative”suggests a dramatic and contingentconstruction of meaning.Wittig understands gender as the workings of “sex,”where “sex”isan obligatory injunction for the body to become a cultural sign,tomaterialize itself in obedience to a historically delimited possibility,andto do this,not once or twice,but as a sustained and repeated corporealproject.The notion of a “project,”however,suggests the originatingforce of a radical will,and because gender is a project which has cultur-al survival as its end,the term strategybetter suggests the situation of

duress under which gender performance always and variously occurs.Hence,as a strategy of survival within compulsory systems,gender is aperformance with clearly punitive consequences.Discrete genders arepart of what “humanizes”individuals within contemporary culture;indeed,we regularly punish those who fail to do their gender right.Because there is neither an “essence”that gender expresses or external-izes nor an objective ideal to which gender aspires,and because genderis not a fact,the various acts of gender create the idea of gender,andwithout those acts,there would be no gender at all.Gender is,thus,aconstruction that regularly conceals its genesis;the tacit collectiveagreement to perform,produce,and sustain discrete and polar gendersas cultural fictions is obscured by the credibility of those productions—and the punishments that attend not agreeing to believe in them;theconstruction “compels”our belief in its necessity and naturalness.Thehistorical possibilities materialized through various corporeal styles arenothing other than those punitively regulated cultural fictions alter-nately embodied and deflected under duress.Consider that a sedimentation of gender norms produces thepeculiar phenomenon of a “natural sex”or a “real woman”or any num-ber of prevalent and compelling social fictions,and that this is a sedi-mentation that over time has produced a set of corporeal styles which,in reified form,appear as the natural configuration of bodies into sexesexisting in a binary relation to one another.If these styles are enacted,and if they produce the coherent gendered subjects who pose as theiroriginators,what kind of performance might reveal this ostensible“cause”to be an “effect”?In what senses,then,is gender an act? As in other ritual social dra-mas,the action of gender requires a performance that is repeated.Thisrepetition is at once a reenactment and reexperiencing of a set ofmeanings already socially established;and it is the mundane and ritual-ized form of their legitimation.71Although there are individual bodiesthat enact these significations by becoming stylized into genderedmodes,this “action”is a public action.There are temporal and collec-

tive dimensions to these actions,and their public character is notinconsequential;indeed,the performance is effected with the strategicaim of maintaining gender within its binary frame—an aim that cannotbe attributed to a subject,but,rather,must be understood to foundand consolidate the subject.Gender ought not to be construed as a stable identity or locus ofagency from which various acts follow;rather,gender is an identitytenuously constituted in time,instituted in an exterior space through astylized repetition of acts.The effect of gender is produced through thestylization of the body and,hence,must be understood as the mundaneway in which bodily gestures,movements,and styles of various kindsconstitute the illusion of an abiding gendered self.This formulationmoves the conception of gender off the ground of a substantial modelof identity to one that requires a conception of gender as a constitutedsocial temporality.Significantly,if gender is instituted through actswhich are internally discontinuous,then the appearance of substanceisprecisely that,a constructed identity,a performative accomplishmentwhich the mundane social audience,including the actors themselves,come to believe and to perform in the mode of belief.Gender is also anorm that can never be fully internalized;“the internal”is a surface sig-nification,and gender norms are finally phantasmatic,impossible toembody.If the ground of gender identity is the stylized repetition ofacts through time and not a seemingly seamless identity,then the spa-tial metaphor of a “ground”will be displaced and revealed as a stylizedconfiguration,indeed,a gendered corporealization of time.The abid-ing gendered self will then be shown to be structured by repeated actsthat seek to approximate the ideal of a substantial ground of identity,but which,in their occasional discontinuity,reveal the temporal andcontingent groundlessness of this “ground.”The possibilities of gendertransformation are to be found precisely in the arbitrary relationbetween such acts,in the possibility of a failure to repeat,a de-formity,or a parodic repetition that exposes the phantasmatic effect of abidingidentity as a politically tenuous construction.

If gender attributes,however,are not expressive but performative,then these attributes effectively constitute the identity they are said toexpress or reveal.The distinction between expression and performa-tiveness is crucial.If gender attributes and acts,the various ways inwhich a body shows or produces its cultural signification,are perfor-mative,then there is no preexisting identity by which an act orattribute might be measured;there would be no true or false,real ordistorted acts of gender,and the postulation of a true gender identitywould be revealed as a regulatory fiction.That gender reality is createdthrough sustained social performances means that the very notions ofan essential sex and a true or abiding masculinity or femininity are alsoconstituted as part of the strategy that conceals gender’s performativecharacter and the performative possibilities for proliferating genderconfigurations outside the restricting frames of masculinist dominationand compulsory heterosexuality.Genders can be neither true nor false,neither real nor appar-ent,neither original nor derived.As credible bearers of those attribut-es,however,genders can also be rendered thoroughly and radicallyincredible.

Conclusion:From Parody to PoliticsI began with the speculative question of whether feminist politics coulddo without a “subject”in the category of women.At stake is not whetherit still makes sense,strategically or transitionally,to refer to women inorder to make representational claims in their behalf.The feminist “we”is always and only a phantasmatic construction,one that has its purpos-es,but which denies the internal complexity and indeterminacy of theterm and constitutes itself only through the exclusion of some part ofthe constituency that it simultaneously seeks to represent.The tenuousor phantasmatic status of the “we,”however,is not cause for despair or,at least,it is not only cause for despair.The radical instability of the cate-gory sets into question the foundational restrictions on feminist politicaltheorizing and opens up other configurations,not only of genders andbodies,but of politics itself.The foundationalist reasoning of identity politics tends to assumethat an identity must first be in place in order for political interests to beelaborated and,subsequently,political action to be taken.My argumentis that there need not be a “doer behind the deed,”but that the “doer”isvariably constructed in and through the deed.This is not a return to anexistential theory of the self as constituted through its acts,for the exis-tential theory maintains a prediscursive structure for both the self andits acts.It is precisely the discursively variable construction of each inand through the other that has interested me here.

The question of locating “agency”is usually associated with the via-bility of the “subject,”where the “subject”is understood to have somestable existence prior to the cultural field that it negotiates.Or,if thesubject is culturally constructed,it is nevertheless vested with an agency,usually figured as the capacity for reflexive mediation,that remainsintact regardless of its cultural embeddedness.On such a model,“cul-ture”and “discourse”mire the subject,but do not constitute that subject.This move to qualify and enmire the preexisting subject has appearednecessary to establish a point of agency that is not fully determined by thatculture and discourse.And yet,this kind of reasoning falsely presumes(a) agency can only be established through recourse to a prediscursive“I,”even if that “I”is found in the midst of a discursive convergence,and(b) that to be constituted by discourse is to be determined by discourse,where determination forecloses the possibility of agency.Even within the theories that maintain a highly qualified or situat-ed subject,the subject still encounters its discursively constitutedenvironment in an oppositional epistemological frame.The culturallyenmired subject negotiates its constructions,even when those con-structions are the very predicates of its own identity.In Beauvoir,forexample,there is an “I”that does its gender,that becomes its gender,but that “I,”invariably associated with its gender,is nevertheless a pointof agency never fully identifiable with its gender.That cogito is neverfully of the cultural world that it negotiates,no matter the narrownessof the ontological distance that separates that subject from its culturalpredicates.The theories of feminist identity that elaborate predicatesof color,sexuality,ethnicity,class,and able-bodiedness invariably closewith an embarrassed “etc.”at the end of the list.Through this horizon-tal trajectory of adjectives,these positions strive to encompass a situat-ed subject,but invariably fail to be complete.This failure,however,isinstructive:what political impetus is to be derived from the exasperat-ed “etc.”that so often occurs at the end of such lines? This is a sign ofexhaustion as well as of the illimitable process of signification itself.Itis the supplément,the excess that necessarily accompanies any effort to

182




posit identity once and for all.This illimitable et cetera,however,offersitself as a new departure for feminist political theorizing.If identity is asserted through a process of signification,if identityis always already signified,and yet continues to signify as it circulateswithin various interlocking discourses,then the question of agency isnot to be answered through recourse to an “I”that preexists significa-tion.In other words,the enabling conditions for an assertion of “I”areprovided by the structure of signification,the rules that regulate thelegitimate and illegitimate invocation of that pronoun,the practicesthat establish the terms of intelligibility by which that pronoun can cir-culate.Language is not an exterior medium or instrument into which Ipour a self and from which I glean a reflection of that self.TheHegelian model of self-recognition that has been appropriated byMarx,Lukacs,and a variety of contemporary liberatory discoursespresupposes a potential adequation between the “I”that confronts itsworld,including its language,as an object,and the “I”that finds itself asan object in that world.But the subject/object dichotomy,which herebelongs to the tradition of Western epistemology,conditions the veryproblematic of identity that it seeks to solve.What discursive tradition establishes the “I”and its “Other”in anepistemological confrontation that subsequently decides where andhow questions of knowability and agency are to be determined? Whatkinds of agency are foreclosed through the positing of an epistemolog-ical subject precisely because the rules and practices that govern theinvocation of that subject and regulate its agency in advance are ruledout as sites of analysis and critical intervention? That the epistemologi-cal point of departure is in no sense inevitable is naively and pervasive-ly confirmed by the mundane operations of ordinary language—widelydocumented within anthropology—that regard the subject/objectdichotomy as a strange and contingent,if not violent,philosophi-cal imposition.The language of appropriation,instrumentality,anddistanciation germane to the epistemological mode also belong to astrategy of domination that pits the “I”against an “Other”and,once

that separation is effected,creates an artificial set of questions aboutthe knowability and recoverability of that Other.As part of the epistemological inheritance of contemporary politi-cal discourses of identity,this binary opposition is a strategic movewithin a given set of signifying practices,one that establishes the “I”inand through this opposition and which reifies that opposition as anecessity,concealing the discursive apparatus by which the binaryitself is constituted.The shift from an epistemological account of identityto one which locates the problematic within practices of significationpermits an analysis that takes the epistemological mode itself as onepossible and contingent signifying practice.Further,the question ofagency is reformulated as a question of how signification and resignifi-cation work.In other words,what is signified as an identity is not sig-nified at a given point in time after which it is simply there as an inertpiece of entitative language.Clearly,identities can appear as so manyinert substantives;indeed,epistemological models tend to take thisappearance as their point of theoretical departure.However,the sub-stantive “I”only appears as such through a signifying practice that seeksto conceal its own workings and to naturalize its effects.Further,toqualify as a substantive identity is an arduous task,for such appear-ances are rule-generated identities,ones which rely on the consistentand repeated invocation of rules that condition and restrict culturallyintelligible practices of identity.Indeed,to understand identity as apractice,and as a signifying practice,is to understand culturally intelli-gible subjects as the resulting effects of a rule-bound discourse thatinserts itself in the pervasive and mundane signifying acts of linguisticlife.Abstractly considered,language refers to an open system of signsby which intelligibility is insistently created and contested.As histori-cally specific organizations of language,discourses present themselvesin the plural,coexisting within temporal frames,and institutingunpredictable and inadvertent convergences from which specificmodalities of discursive possibilities are engendered.As a process,signification harbors within itself what the epistemo-

logical discourse refers to as “agency.”The rules that govern intelligibleidentity,i.e.,that enable and restrict the intelligible assertion of an “I,”rules that are partially structured along matrices of gender hierarchyand compulsory heterosexuality,operate through repetition.Indeed,when the subject is said to be constituted,that means simply that thesubject is a consequence of certain rule-governed discourses that gov-ern the intelligible invocation of identity.The subject is not determinedby the rules through which it is generated because signification is not afounding act,but rather a regulated process ofrepetition that both concealsitself and enforces its rules precisely through the production of sub-stantializing effects.In a sense,all signification takes place within theorbit of the compulsion to repeat;“agency,”then,is to be located with-in the possibility of a variation on that repetition.If the rules governingsignification not only restrict,but enable the assertion of alternativedomains of cultural intelligibility,i.e.,new possibilities for gender thatcontest the rigid codes of hierarchical binarisms,then it is only withinthe practices of repetitive signifying that a subversion of identitybecomes possible.The injunction to be a given gender produces neces-sary failures,a variety of incoherent configurations that in their multi-plicity exceed and defy the injunction by which they are generated.Further,the very injunction to be a given gender takes place throughdiscursive routes:to be a good mother,to be a heterosexually desirableobject,to be a fit worker,in sum,to signify a multiplicity of guaranteesin response to a variety of different demands all at once.The coexis-tence or convergence of such discursive injunctions produces the pos-sibility of a complex reconfiguration and redeployment;it is not atranscendental subject who enables action in the midst of such a con-vergence.There is no self that is prior to the convergence or whomaintains “integrity”prior to its entrance into this conflicted culturalfield.There is only a taking up of the tools where they lie,where thevery “taking up”is enabled by the tool lying there.What constitutes a subversive repetition within signifying prac-tices of gender? I have argued (“I”deploy the grammar that governs the

185




genre of the philosophical conclusion,but note that it is the grammaritself that deploys and enables this “I,”even as the “I”that insists itselfhere repeats,redeploys,and—as the critics will determine—conteststhe philosophical grammar by which it is both enabled and restricted)that,for instance,within the sex/gender distinction,sex poses as “thereal”and the “factic,”the material or corporeal ground upon whichgender operates as an act of cultural inscription.And yet gender is notwritten on the body as the torturing instrument of writing in Kafka’s“In the Penal Colony”inscribes itself unintelligibly on the flesh of theaccused.The question is not:what meaning does that inscription carrywithin it,but what cultural apparatus arranges this meeting betweeninstrument and body,what interventions into this ritualistic repetitionare possible? The “real”and the “sexually factic”are phantasmatic con-structions—illusions of substance—that bodies are compelled toapproximate,but never can.What,then,enables the exposure of therift between the phantasmatic and the real whereby the real admitsitself as phantasmatic? Does this offer the possibility for a repetitionthat is not fully constrained by the injunction to reconsolidate natural-ized identities? Just as bodily surfaces are enacted as the natural,sothese surfaces can become the site of a dissonant and denaturalizedperformance that reveals the performative status of the natural itself.Practices of parody can serve to reengage and reconsolidate thevery distinction between a privileged and naturalized gender configu-ration and one that appears as derived,phantasmatic,and mimetic—afailed copy,as it were.And surely parody has been used to further apolitics of despair,one which affirms a seemingly inevitable exclusionof marginal genders from the territory of the natural and the real.Andyet this failure to become “real”and to embody “the natural”is,I wouldargue,a constitutive failure of all gender enactments for the very rea-son that these ontological locales are fundamentally uninhabitable.Hence,there is a subversive laughter in the pastiche-effect of parodicpractices in which the original,the authentic,and the real are them-

selves constituted as effects.The loss of gender norms would have theeffect of proliferating gender configurations,destabilizing substantiveidentity,and depriving the naturalizing narratives of compulsory het-erosexuality of their central protagonists:“man”and “woman.”Theparodic repetition of gender exposes as well the illusion of genderidentity as an intractable depth and inner substance.As the effects of asubtle and politically enforced performativity,gender is an “act,”as itwere,that is open to splittings,self-parody,self-criticism,and thosehyperbolic exhibitions of “the natural”that,in their very exaggeration,reveal its fundamentally phantasmatic status.I have tried to suggest that the identity categories often presumedto be foundational to feminist politics,that is,deemed necessary inorder to mobilize feminism as an identity politics,simultaneouslywork to limit and constrain in advance the very cultural possibilitiesthat feminism is supposed to open up.The tacit constraints that pro-duce culturally intelligible “sex”ought to be understood as generativepolitical structures rather than naturalized foundations.Paradoxically,the reconceptualization of identity as an effect,that is,as produced orgenerated,opens up possibilities of “agency”that are insidiously fore-closed by positions that take identity categories as foundational andfixed.For an identity to be an effect means that it is neither fatallydetermined nor fully artificial and arbitrary.That the constituted statusof identity is misconstrued along these two conflicting lines suggeststhe ways in which the feminist discourse on cultural constructionremains trapped within the unnecessary binarism of free will anddeterminism.Construction is not opposed to agency;it is the neces-sary scene of agency,the very terms in which agency is articulated andbecomes culturally intelligible.The critical task for feminism is not toestablish a point of view outside of constructed identities;that conceitis the construction of an epistemological model that would disavow itsown cultural location and,hence,promote itself as a global subject,aposition that deploys precisely the imperialist strategies that feminism

From Parody to Politics

187




ought to criticize.The critical task is,rather,to locate strategies of sub-versive repetition enabled by those constructions,to affirm the localpossibilities of intervention through participating in precisely thosepractices of repetition that constitute identity and,therefore,presentthe immanent possibility of contesting them.This theoretical inquiry has attempted to locate the political in thevery signifying practices that establish,regulate,and deregulate identi-ty.This effort,however,can only be accomplished through the intro-duction of a set of questions that extend the very notion of thepolitical.How to disrupt the foundations that cover over alternativecultural configurations of gender? How to destabilize and render intheir phantasmatic dimension the “premises”of identity politics?This task has required a critical genealogy of the naturalization ofsex and of bodies in general.It has also demanded a reconsideration ofthe figure of the body as mute,prior to culture,awaiting signification,a figure that cross-checks with the figure of the feminine,awaiting theinscription-as-incision of the masculine signifier for entrance into lan-guage and culture.From a political analysis of compulsory heterosexu-ality,it has been necessary to question the construction of sex asbinary,as a hierarchical binary.From the point of view of gender asenacted,questions have emerged over the fixity of gender identity asan interior depth that is said to be externalized in various forms of“expression.”The implicit construction of the primary heterosexualconstruction of desire is shown to persist even as it appears in themode of primary bisexuality.Strategies of exclusion and hierarchy arealso shown to persist in the formulation of the sex/gender distinctionand its recourse to “sex”as the prediscursive as well as the priority ofsexuality to culture and,in particular,the cultural construction of sex-uality as the prediscursive.Finally,the epistemological paradigm thatpresumes the priority of the doer to the deed establishes a global andglobalizing subject who disavows its own locality as well as the condi-tions for local intervention.

If taken as the grounds of feminist theory or politics,these“effects”of gender hierarchy and compulsory heterosexuality are notonly misdescribed as foundations,but the signifying practices thatenable this metaleptic misdescription remain outside the purview of afeminist critique of gender relations.To enter into the repetitive prac-tices of this terrain of signification is not a choice,for the “I”that mightenter is always already inside:there is no possibility of agency or reali-ty outside of the discursive practices that give those terms the intelligi-bility that they have.The task is not whether to repeat,but how torepeat or,indeed,to repeat and,through a radical proliferation of gen-der,to displace the very gender norms that enable the repetition itself.There is no ontology of gender on which we might construct a poli-tics,for gender ontologies always operate within established politicalcontexts as normative injunctions,determining what qualifies as intel-ligible sex,invoking and consolidating the reproductive constraints onsexuality,setting the prescriptive requirements whereby sexed or gen-dered bodies come into cultural intelligibility.Ontology is,thus,not afoundation,but a normative injunction that operates insidiously byinstalling itself into political discourse as its necessary ground.The deconstruction of identity is not the deconstruction of poli-tics;rather,it establishes as political the very terms through whichidentity is articulated.This kind of critique brings into question thefoundationalist frame in which feminism as an identity politics hasbeen articulated.The internal paradox of this foundationalism is that itpresumes,fixes,and constrains the very “subjects”that it hopes to rep-resent and liberate.The task here is not to celebrate each and everynew possibility qua possibility,but to redescribe those possibilities thatalready exist,but which exist within cultural domains designated asculturally unintelligible and impossible.If identities were no longerfixed as the premises of a political syllogism,and politics no longerunderstood as a set of practices derived from the alleged interests thatbelong to a set of ready-made subjects,a new configuration of politics

From Parody to Politics

would surely emerge from the ruins of the old.Cultural configurationsof sex and gender might then proliferate or,rather,their present pro-liferation might then become articulable within the discourses thatestablish intelligible cultural life,confounding the very binarism ofsex,and exposing its fundamental unnaturalness.What other localstrategies for engaging the “unnatural”might lead to the denaturaliza-tion of gender as such?

NotesPreface (1999)1.At this printing,there are French publishers considering the translationof this work,but only because Didier Eribon and others have inserted thearguments of the text into current French political debates on the legalratification of same-sex partnerships.2.I have written two brief pieces on this issue:“Afterword”for Butch\Femme:Inside Lesbian Gender,ed.Sally Munt (London:Cassell,1998),and anoth-er Afterword for “Transgender in Latin America:Persons,Practices andMeanings,”a special issue of the journal Sexualities,Vol.5,No.3,1998.3.Catharine MacKinnon,Feminism Unmodified:Discourses on Life and Law(Cambridge:Harvard University Press,1987),pp.6–7.4.Unfortunately,Gender Troublepreceded the publication of Eve KosofskySedgwick’s monumental Epistemology of the Closet(Berkeley and LosAngeles:University of California Press,1991) by some months,and myarguments here were not able to benefit from her nuanced discussion ofgender and sexuality in the first chapter of that book.5.Jonathan Goldberg persuaded me of this point.6.For a more or less complete bibliography of my publications and cita-tions of my work,see the excellent work of Eddie Yeghiayan at the Uni-versity of California at Irvine Library:http://sun3.lib.uci.edu/~scctr/Wellek/index.html.7.I am especially indebted to Biddy Martin,Eve Sedgwick,Slavoj Zˇizˇek,Wendy Brown,Saidiya Hartman,Mandy Merck,Lynne Layton,TimothyKaufmann-Osborne,Jessica Benjamin,Seyla Benhabib,Nancy Fraser,




Diana Fuss,Jay Presser,Lisa Duggan,and Elizabeth Grosz for their insight-ful criticisms of the theory of performativity.8.This notion of the ritual dimension of performativity is allied with thenotion of the habitus in Pierre Bourdieu’s work,something which I onlycame to realize after the fact of writing this text.For my belated effort toaccount for this resonance,see the final chapter of Excitable Speech:APolitics of the Performative(New York:Routledge,1997).9.Jacqueline Rose usefully pointed out to me the disjunction between theearlier and later parts of this text.The earlier parts interrogate themelancholy construction of gender,but the later seem to forget the psy-choanalytic beginnings.Perhaps this accounts for some of the “mania”ofthe final chapter,a state defined by Freud as part of the disavowal of lossthat is melancholia.Gender Troublein its closing pages seems to forget ordisavow the loss it has just articulated.10.See Bodies that Matter(New York:Routledge,1993) as well as an able andinteresting critique that relates some of the questions raised there tocontemporary science studies by Karen Barad,“Getting Real:Technoscientific Practices and the Materialization of Reality,”differences,Vol.5,No.2,pp.87–126.11.Saidiya Hartman,Lisa Lowe,and Dorinne Kondo are scholars whosework has influenced my own.Much of the current scholarship on “pass-ing”has also taken up this question.My own essay on Nella Larsen’s“Passing”in Bodies That Mattersought to address the question in a prelimi-nary way.Of course,Homi Bhabha’s work on the mimetic splitting of thepostcolonial subject is close to my own in several ways:not only theappropriation of the colonial “voice”by the colonized,but the split con-dition of identification are crucial to a notion of performativity thatemphasizes the way minority identities are produced and riven at thesame time under conditions of domination.12.The work of Kobena Mercer,Kendall Thomas,and Hortense Spillers hasbeen extremely useful to my post-Gender Trouble thinking on this subject.I also hope to publish an essay on Frantz Fanon soon engaging questionsof mimesis and hyperbole in his Black Skins,White Masks.I am grateful toGreg Thomas,who has recently completed his dissertation in rhetoric atBerkeley,on racialized sexualities in the U.S.,for provoking and enrich-ing my understanding of this crucial intersection.

13.I have offered reflections on universality in subsequent writings,mostprominently in chapter 2 of Excitable Speech.14.See the important publications of the Intersex Society of North America(including the publications of Cheryl Chase) which has,more than anyother organization,brought to public attention the severe and violentgender policing done to infants and children born with gender anom-alous bodies.For more information,contact them athttp://www.isna.org.15.I thank Wendy Brown,Joan W.Scott,Alexandra Chasin,FrancesBartkowski,Janet Halley,Michel Feher,Homi Bhabha,Drucilla Cornell,Denise Riley,Elizabeth Weed,Kaja Silverman,Ann Pellegrini,WilliamConnolly,Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak,Ernesto Laclau,Eduardo Cadava,Florence Dore,David Kazanjian,David End,and Dina Al-kassim for their support and friendship during the Spring of 1999 when this prefacewas written.1.Subjects of Sex/Gender/Desire1.See Michel Foucault,“Right of Death and Power over Life,”in The Historyof Sexuality,Volume I,An Introduction,trans.Robert Hurley (New York:Vintage,1980),originally published as Histoire de la sexualité 1:La volontéde savoir (Paris:Gallimard,1978).In that final chapter,Foucault discussesthe relation between the juridical and productive law.His notion of theproductivity of the law is clearly derived from Nietzsche,although notidentical with Nietzsche’s will-to-power.The use of Foucault’s notion ofproductive power is not meant as a simple-minded “application”ofFoucault to gender issues.As I show in chapter 3,section ii,“Foucault,Herculine,and the Politics of Sexual Discontinuity,”the consideration ofsexual difference within the terms of Foucault’s own work reveals cen-tral contradictions in his theory.His view of the body also comes undercriticism in the final chapter.2.References throughout this work to a subject before the law are extrapo-lations of Derrida’s reading of Kafka’s parable “Before the Law,”in Kafkaand the Contemporary Critical Performance:Centenary Readings,ed.AlanUdoff (Bloomington:Indiana University Press,1987).3.See Denise Riley,Am I That Name?:Feminism and the Category of ‘Women’inHistory (New York:Macmillan,1988).

4.See Sandra Harding,“The Instability of the Analytical Categories ofFeminist Theory,”in Sex and Scientific Inquiry,eds.Sandra Harding andJean F.O’Barr (Chicago:University of Chicago Press,1987),pp.283–302.5.I am reminded of the ambiguity inherent in Nancy Cott’s title,TheGrounding of Modern Feminism (New Haven:Yale University Press,1987).She argues that the early twentieth-century U.S.feminist movementsought to “ground”itself in a program that eventually “grounded”thatmovement.Her historical thesis implicitly raises the question of whetheruncritically accepted foundations operate like the “return of therepressed”;based on exclusionary practices,the stable political identitiesthat found political movements may invariably become threatened by thevery instability that the foundationalist move creates.6.I use the term heterosexual matrix throughout the text to designate thatgrid of cultural intelligibility through which bodies,genders,and desiresare naturalized.I am drawing from Monique Wittig’s notion of the “het-erosexual contract”and,to a lesser extent,on Adrienne Rich’s notion of“compulsory heterosexuality”to characterize a hegemonic discursive/epistemic model of gender intelligibility that assumes that for bodies tocohere and make sense there must be a stable sex expressed through astable gender (masculine expresses male,feminine expresses female)that is oppositionally and hierarchically defined through the compulsorypractice of heterosexuality.7.For a discussion of the sex/gender distinction in structuralist anthropolo-gy and feminist appropriations and criticisms of that formulation,seechapter 2,section i,“Structuralism’s Critical Exchange.”8.For an interesting study of the berdache and multiple-gender arrangementsin Native American cultures,see Walter L.Williams,The Spirit and theFlesh:Sexual Diversity in American Indian Culture (Boston:Beacon Press,1988).See also,Sherry B.Ortner and Harriet Whitehead,eds.,SexualMeanings:The Cultural Construction of Sexuality (New York:CambridgeUniversity Press,1981).For a politically sensitive and provocative analysisof the berdache,transsexuals,and the contingency of gender dichotomies,see Suzanne J.Kessler and Wendy McKenna,Gender:An EthnomethodologicalApproach (Chicago:University of Chicago Press,1978).

9.A great deal of feminist research has been conducted within the fields ofbiology and the history of science that assess the political interests inher-ent in the various discriminatory procedures that establish the scientificbasis for sex.See Ruth Hubbard and Marian Lowe,eds.,Genes and Gender,vols.1 and 2 (New York:Gordian Press,1978,1979);the two issues onfeminism and science of Hypatia:A Journal of Feminist Philosophy,Vol.2,No.3,Fall 1987,and Vol.3,No.1,Spring 1988,and especially TheBiology and Gender Study Group,“The Importance of Feminist Critiquefor Contemporary Cell Biology”in this last issue (Spring 1988);SandraHarding,The Science Question in Feminism (Ithaca:Cornell UniversityPress,1986);Evelyn Fox Keller,Reflections on Gender and Science (NewHaven:Yale University Press,1984);Donna Haraway,“In the Beginningwas the Word:The Genesis of Biological Theory,”Signs:Journal of Women inCulture and Society,Vol.6,No.3,1981;Donna Haraway,Primate Visions(New York:Routledge,1989);Sandra Harding and Jean F.O’Barr,Sexand Scientific Inquiry (Chicago:University of Chicago Press,1987);AnneFausto-Sterling,Myths of Gender:Biological Theories About Women and Men(New York:Norton,1979).10.Clearly Foucault’s History of Sexuality offers one way to rethink the historyof “sex”within a given modern Eurocentric context.For a more detailedconsideration,see Thomas Lacqueur and Catherine Gallagher,eds.,TheMaking of the Modern Body:Sexuality and Society in the 19th Century(Berkeley:University of California Press,1987),originally published asan issue of Representations,No.14,Spring 1986.11.See my “Variations on Sex and Gender:Beauvoir,Wittig,Foucault,”inFeminism as Critique,eds.Seyla Benhabib and Drucilla Cornell (BasilBlackwell,dist.by University of Minnesota Press,1987).12.Simone de Beauvoir,The Second Sex,trans.E.M.Parshley (New York:Vintage,1973),p.301.13.Ibid.,p.38.14.See my “Sex and Gender in Beauvoir’s Second Sex’’Yale French Studies,Simone de Beauvoir:Witness to a Century,No.72,Winter 1986.15.Note the extent to which phenomenological theories such as Sartre’s,Merleau-Ponty’s,and Beauvoir’s tend to use the term embodiment.Drawnas it is from theological contexts,the term tends to figure “the”body as a

mode of incarnation and,hence,to preserve the external and dualisticrelationship between a signifying immateriality and the materiality of thebody itself.16.See Luce Irigaray,This SexWhich Is Not One,trans.Catherine Porter withCarolyn Burke (Ithaca:Cornell University Press,1985),originally pub-lished as Ce sexe qui n’en est pas un (Paris:Éditions de Minuit,1977).17.See Joan Scott,“Gender as a Useful Category of Historical Analysis,”inGender and the Politics of History (New York:Columbia University Press,1988),pp.28–52,repr.from American Historical Review,Vol.91,No.5,1986.18.Beauvoir,The Second Sex,p.xxvi.19.See my “Sex and Gender in Beauvoir’s Second Sex.”20.The normative ideal of the body as both a “situation”and an “instrumen-tality”is embraced by both Beauvoir with respect to gender and FrantzFanon with respect to race.Fanon concludes his analysis of colonizationthrough recourse to the body as an instrument of freedom,where free-dom is,in Cartesian fashion,equated with a consciousness capable ofdoubt:“O my body,make of me always a man who questions!”(FrantzFanon,Black Skin,White Masks [New York:Grove Press,1967] p.323,originally published as Peau noire,masques blancs [Paris:Éditions de Seuil,1952]).21.The radical ontological disjunction in Sartre between consciousness andthe body is part of the Cartesian inheritance of his philosophy.Sig-nificantly,it is Descartes’distinction that Hegel implicitly interrogates atthe outset of the “Master-Slave”section of The Phenomenology of Spirit.Beauvoir’s analysis of the masculine Subject and the feminine Other isclearly situated in Hegel’s dialectic and in the Sartrian reformulation ofthat dialectic in the section on sadism and masochism in Being andNothingness.Critical of the very possibility of a “synthesis”of conscious-ness and the body,Sartre effectively returns to the Cartesian problemat-ic that Hegel sought to overcome.Beauvoir insists that the body can bethe instrument and situation of freedom and that sex can be the occasionfor a gender that is not a reification,but a modality of freedom.At firstthis appears to be a synthesis of body and consciousness,where con-sciousness is understood as the condition of freedom.The question that

remains,however,is whether this synthesis requires and maintains theontological distinction between body and mind of which it is composedand,by association,the hierarchy of mind over body and of masculineover feminine.22.See Elizabeth V.Spelman,“Woman as Body:Ancient and ContemporaryViews,”Feminist Studies,Vol.8,No.1,Spring 1982.23.Gayatri Spivak most pointedly elaborates this particular kind of binaryexplanation as a colonizing act of marginalization.In a critique of the“self-presence of the cognizing supra-historical self,”which is character-istic of the epistemic imperialism of the philosophical cogito,she locatespolitics in the production of knowledge that creates and censors the mar-gins that constitute,through exclusion,the contingent intelligibility ofthat subject’s given knowledge-regime:“I call ‘politics as such’the prohi-bition of marginality that is implicit in the production of any explana-tion.From that point of view,the choice of particular binary oppositions...is no mere intellectual strategy.It is,in each case,the condition of thepossibility for centralization (with appropriate apologies) and,corre-spondingly,marginalization”(Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak,“Explanationand Culture:Marginalia,”in In Other Worlds:Essays in Cultural Politics [NewYork:Routledge,1987],p.113).24.See the argument against “ranking oppressions”in Cherríe Moraga,“LaGüera,”in This Bridge Called My Back:Writings of RadicalWomen of Color,eds.Gloria Anzaldúa and Cherríe Moraga (New York:Kitchen Table,Women of Color Press,1982).25.For a fuller elaboration of the unrepresentability of women in phallogo-centric discourse,see Luce Irigaray,“Any Theory of the ‘Subject’HasAlways Been Appropriated by the Masculine,”in Speculum of the OtherWoman,trans.Gillian C.Gill (Ithaca:Cornell University Press,1985).Irigaray appears to revise this argument in her discussion of“the femi-nine gender”in Sexes et parentés(see chapter 2,n.10).26.Monique Wittig,“One is Not Born a Woman,”Feminist Issues,Vol.1,No.2,Winter 1981,p.53.Also in The Straight Mind and Other Essays,pp.9–20,see chapter 3,n.49.27.The notion of the “Symbolic”is discussed at some length in Section Two of this text.It is to be understood as an ideal and universal set of

cultural laws that govern kinship and signification and,within the terms of psychoanalytic structuralism,govern the production of sexualdifference.Based on the notion of an idealized “paternal law,”theSymbolic is reformulated by Irigaray as a dominant and hegemonic dis-course of phallogocentrism.Some French feminists propose an alterna-tive language to one governed by the Phallus or the paternal law,and sowage a critique against the Symbolic.Kristeva proposes the “semiotic”asa specifically maternal dimension of language,and both Irigaray andHélène Cixous have been associated with écriture feminine.Wittig,howev-er,has always resisted that movement,claiming that language in its struc-ture is neither misogynist nor feminist,but an instrumentto be deployedfor developed political purposes.Clearly her belief in a “cognitive sub-ject”that exists prior to language facilitates her understanding of lan-guage as an instrument,rather than as a field of significations thatpreexist and structure subject-formation itself.28.Monique Wittig,“The Point of View:Universal or Particular?”FeministIssues,Vol.3,No.2,Fall 1983,p.64.Also in The Straight Mind and OtherEssays,pp.59–67,see chapter 3,n.49.29.“One must assume both a particular anda universal point of view,at leastto be part of literature”(Monique Wittig,“The Trojan Horse,”FeministIssues,Vol.4,No.2,Fall 1984,p.68.Also see chapter 3,n.41).30.The journal,Questions Feministes,available in English translation as FeministIssues,generally defended a “materialist”point of view which took prac-tices,institution,and the constructed status of language to be the “mate-rial grounds”of the oppression of women.Wittig was part of the originaleditorial staff.Along with Monique Plaza,Wittig argued that sexual dif-ference was essentialist in that it derived the meaning of women’s socialfunction from their biological facticity,but also because it subscribed tothe primary signification of women’s bodies as maternal and,hence,gaveideological strength to the hegemony of reproductive sexuality.31.Michel Haar,“Nietzsche and Metaphysical Language,”The New Nietzsche:Contemporary Styles of Interpretation,ed.David Allison (New York:Delta,1977),pp.17–18.32.Monique Wittig,“The Mark of Gender,”Feminist Issues,Vol.5,No.2,Fall1985,p.4.Also see chapter 3,n.25.

33.Ibid.,p.3.34.Aretha’s song,originally written by Carole King,also contests the natu-ralization of gender.“Like a natural woman”is a phrase that suggests that“naturalness”is only accomplished through analogy or metaphor.In otherwords,“You make me feel like a metaphor of the natural,”and without“you,”some denaturalized ground would be revealed.For a further dis-cussion of Aretha’s claim in light of Simone de Beauvoir’s contention that“one is not born,but rather becomes a woman,”see my “Beauvoir’sPhilosophical Contribution,”in eds.Ann Garry and Marilyn Pearsall,Women,Knowledge,and Reality(Boston:Unwin Hyman,1989):2nd ed.(New York:Routledge,1996).35.Michel Foucault,ed.,Herculine Barbin,Being the Recently Discovered Memoirsof a Nineteenth-Century Hermaphrodite,trans.Richard McDougall (NewYork:Colophon,1980),originally published as Herculine Barbin,diteAlexina B.presenté par Michel Foucault(Paris:Gallimard,1978).The Frenchversion lacks the introduction supplied by Foucault with the Englishtranslation.36.See chapter 2,section ii.37.Foucault,ed.,Herculine Barbin,p.x.38.Robert Stoller,Presentations of Gender (New Haven:Yale University Press,1985),pp.11–14.39.Friedrich Nietzsche,On the Genealogy of Morals,trans.Walter Kaufmann(New York:Vintage,1969),p.45.40.Wittig,“One is Not Born a Woman,”p.48.Wittig credits both the notionof the “mark”of gender and the “imaginary formation”of natural groupsto Colette Guillaumin whose work on the mark of race provides an anal-ogy for Wittig’s analysis of gender in “Race et nature:Système des mar-ques,idée de group naturel et rapport sociaux,”Pluriel,Vol.11,1977.The “Myth of Woman”is a chapter of Beauvoir’s The Second Sex.41.Monique Wittig,“Paradigm,”in Homosexualities and French Literature:Cultural Contexts/Critical Texts,eds.Elaine Marks and George Stambolian(Ithaca:Cornell University Press,1979),p.114.42.Clearly,Wittig does not understand syntax to be the linguistic elaborationor reproduction of a kinship system paternally organized.Her refusal ofstructuralism at this level allows her to understand language as gender-

neutral.Irigaray’s Parler n’est jamais neutre (Paris:Éditions de Minuit,1985) criticizes precisely the kind of humanist position,here characteris-tic of Wittig,that claims the political and gender neutrality of language.43.Monique Wittig,“The Point of View:Universal or Particular?”p.63.44.Monique Wittig,“The Straight Mind,”Feminist Issues,Vol.1,No.1,Summer 1980,p.108.Also see chapter 3,n.30.45.Monique Wittig,The Lesbian Body,trans.Peter Owen (New York:Avon,1976),originally published as Le corps lesbien(Paris:Éditions de Minuit,1973).46.I am grateful to Wendy Owen for this phrase.47.Of course,Freud himself distinguished between “the sexual”and “thegenital,”providing the very distinction that Wittig uses against him.See,for instance,“The Development of the Sexual Function”in Freud,Outlineof a Theory of Psychoanalysis,trans.James Strachey (New York:Norton,1979).48.A more comprehensive analysis of the Lacanian position is provided invarious parts of chapter 2 of this text.49.Jacqueline Rose,Sexuality in the Field ofVision(London:Verso,1987).50.Jane Gallop,Reading Lacan(Ithaca:Cornell University Press,1985);TheDaughter’s Seduction:Feminism and Psychoanalysis(Ithaca:Cornell Univer-sity Press,1982).51.“What distinguishes psychoanalysis from sociological accounts of gender(hence for me the fundamental impasse of Nancy Chodorow’s work) isthat whereas for the latter,the internalisation of norms is assumedroughly to work,the basic premise and indeed starting point of psycho-analysis is that it does not.The unconscious constantly reveals the ‘fail-ure’of identity”(Jacqueline Rose,Sexuality in the Field ofVision,p.90).52.It is,perhaps,no wonder that the singular structuralist notion of “theLaw”clearly resonates with the prohibitive law of the Old Testament.The“paternal law”thus comes under a post-structuralist critique through theunderstandable route of a French reappropriation of Nietzsche.Nietzsche faults the Judeo-Christian “slave-morality”for conceiving thelaw in both singular and prohibitive terms.The will-to-power,on theother hand,designates both the productive and multiple possibilities ofthe law,effectively exposing the notion of “the Law”in its singularity as afictive and repressive notion.

“Postmodernism and Consumer Society,”in The Anti-Aesthetic:Essays onPostmodern Culture,ed.Hal Foster (Port Townsend,WA:Bay Press,1983).2.Prohibition,Psychoanalysis,and the Production of theHeterosexual Matrix1.During the semester in which I write this chapter,I am teaching Kafka’s“In the Penal Colony,”which describes an instrument of torture thatprovides an interesting analogy for the contemporary field of power andmasculinist power in particular.The narrative repeatedly falters in itsattempt to recount the history which would enshrine that instrument asa vital part of a tradition.The origins cannot be recovered,and the mapthat might lead to the origins has become unreadable through time.Those to whom it might be explained do not speak the same languageand have no recourse to translation.Indeed,the machine itself cannot befully imagined;its parts don’t fit together in a conceivable whole,so thereader is forced to imagine its state of fragmentation without recourse toan ideal notion of its integrity.This appears to be a literary enactment ofFoucault’s notion that “power”has become so diffuse that it no longerexists as a systematic totality.Derrida interrogates the problematicauthority of such a law in the context of Kafka’s “Before the Law”(inDerrida’s “Before the Law,”in Kafka and the Contemporary Critical Per-formance:Centenary Readings,ed.Alan Udoff [Bloomington:IndianaUniversity Press,1987]).He underscores the radical unjustifiability ofthis repression through a narrative recapitulation of a time before thelaw.Significantly,it also remains impossible to articulate a critique ofthat law through recourse to a time before the law.2.See Carol MacCormack and Marilyn Strathern,eds.Nature,Culture andGender(New York:Cambridge University Press,1980).3.For a fuller discussion of these kinds of issues,see Donna Haraway’s chap-ter,“Gender for a Marxist Dictionary:The Sexual Politics of a Word,”inSimians,Cyborgs,and Women:The Reinvention of Nature (New York:Routledge,1990).4.Gayle Rubin considers this process at length in “The Traffic in Women:Notes on the ‘Political Economy’of Sex,”in Toward an Anthropology ofWomen,ed.Rayna R.Reiter (New York:Monthly Review Press,1975).Her essay will become a focal point later in this chapter.She uses the

notion of the bride-as-gift from Mauss’s Essay on the Gift to show howwomen as objects of exchange effectively consolidate and define thesocial bond between men.5.See Claude Lévi-Strauss,“The Principles of Kinship,”in The ElementaryStructures of Kinship(Boston:Beacon Press,1969),p.496.6.See Jacques Derrida,“Structure,Sign,and Play,”in The StructuralistControversy,eds.Richard Macksey and Eugene Donato (Baltimore:JohnsHopkins University Press,1964);“Linguistics and Grammatology,”in OfGrammatology,trans.Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (Baltimore:JohnsHopkins University Press,1974);“Différance,”in Margins of Philosophy,trans.Alan Bass (Chicago:University of Chicago Press,1982).7.See Lévi-Strauss,The Elementary Structures of Kinship,p.480;“Exchange—and consequently the rule of exogamy which expresses it—has in itself asocial value.It provides the means of binding men together.”8.Luce Irigaray,Speculum of the Other Woman,trans.Gillian C.Gill (Ithaca:Cornell University Press,1985),pp.101–103.9.One might consider the literary analysis of Eve Sedgwick’s Between Men:English Literature and Homosocial Desire(New York:Columbia UniversityPress,1985) in light of Lévi-Strauss’s description of the structures ofreciprocity within kinship.Sedgwick effectively argues that the flatteringattentions paid to women in romantic poetry are both a deflection and an elaboration of male homosocial desire.Women are poetic “objects of exchange”in the sense that they mediate the relationship of un-acknowledged desire between men as the explicit and ostensible objectof discourse.10.Luce Irigaray,Sexes et parentés(Paris:Éditions de Minuit,1987),translatedas Sexes and Genealogies,trans.Gillian C.Gill (New York:ColumbiaUniversity Press,1993).11.Clearly,Lévi-Strauss misses an opportunity to analyze incest as both fan-tasy andsocial practice,the two being in no way mutually exclusive.12.Lévi-Strauss,The Elementary Structures of Kinship,p.491.13.To be the Phallus is to “embody”the Phallus as the place to which it pene-trates,but also to signify the promise of a return to the preindividuatedjouissancethat characterizes the undifferentiated relation to the mother.14.I devote a chapter to Lacan’s appropriation of Hegel’s dialectic of masterand slave,called “Lacan:The Opacity of Desire,”in my Subjects of Desire:

Hegelian Reflections in Twentieth-Century France (New York:Columbia Uni-versity Press,1987;paperback edition,1999).15.Freud understood the achievement of femininity to require a double-wave of repression:“The girl”not only has to shift libidinal attachmentfrom the mother to the father,but then displace the desire for the fatheronto some more acceptable object.For an account that gives an almostmythic cast to Lacan’s theory,see Sarah Kofman,The Enigma of Woman:Woman in Freud’s Writings,trans.Catherine Porter (Ithaca:Cornell Uni-versity Press,1985),pp.143–148,originally published as L’Enigme de lafemme:La femme dans les textes de Freud(Paris:Editions Galilée,1980).16.Jacques Lacan,“The Meaning of the Phallus,”in Feminine Sexuality:JacquesLacan and the École Freudienne,eds.Juliet Mitchell and Jacqueline Rose,trans.Jacqueline Rose (New York:Norton,1985),pp.83–85.Hereafter,page references to this work will appear in the text.17.Luce Irigaray,Ce sexe qui n’en est pas un (Paris:Éditions de Minuit,1977),p.131.18.The feminist literature on masquerade is wide-ranging;the attempt hereis restricted to an analysis of masquerade in relation to the problematicof expression and performativity.In other words,the question here iswhether masquerade conceals a femininity that might be understood asgenuine or authentic,or whether masquerade is the means by whichfemininity and the contests over its “authenticity”are produced.For afuller discussion of feminist appropriations of masquerade,see Mary AnnDoane,The Desire to Desire:The Woman’s Film of the 1940s (Bloomington:Indiana University Press,1987);“Film and Masquerade:Theorizing theFemale Spectator,”Screen,Vol.23,Nos.3–4,September–October 1982,pp.74–87;“Woman’s Stake:Filming the Female Body,”October,Vol.17,Summer 1981.Gayatri Spivak offers a provocative reading of woman-as-masquerade that draws on Nietzsche and Derrida in “Displacement andthe Discourse of Woman,”in Displacement:Derrida and After,ed.MarkKrupnick (Bloomington:Indiana University Press,1983).See also MaryRusso’s “Female Grotesques:Carnival and Theory”(Working Paper,Center for Twentieth-Century Studies,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,1985).19.In the following section of this chapter,“Freud and the Melancholia ofGender,”I attempt to lay out the central meaning of melancholia as the

consequence of a disavowed grief as it applies to the incest taboo whichfounds sexual positions and gender through instituting certain forms ofdisavowed losses.20.Significantly,Lacan’s discussion of the lesbian is continguous within thetext to his discussion of frigidity,as if to suggest metonymically that les-bianism constitutes the denial of sexuality.A further reading of the oper-ation of “denial”in this text is clearly in order.21.Joan Riviere,“Womanliness as a Masquerade,”in Formations of Fantasy,eds.Victor Burgin,James Donald,Cora Kaplan (London:Methuen,1986),pp.35–44.The article was first published in The International Journal ofPsychoanalysis,Vol.10,1929.Hereafter,page references to this work willappear in the text.See also the fine essay by Stephen Heath that follows,“Joan Riviere and the Masquerade.”22.For a contemporary refutation of such plain inferences,see EstherNewton and Shirley Walton,“The Misunderstanding:Toward a MorePrecise Sexual Vocabulary,”in Pleasure and Danger,ed.Carole Vance(Boston:Routledge,1984),pp.242–250.Newton and Walton distin-guish among erotic identities,erotic roles,and erotic acts and show howradical discontinuities can exist between styles of desire and styles ofgender such that erotic preferences cannot be directly inferred from thepresentation of an erotic identity in social contexts.Although I find their analysis useful (and brave),I wonder whether such categories arethemselves specific to discursive contexts and whether that kind of frag-mentation of sexuality into component “parts”makes sense only as acounterstrategy to refute the reductive unification of these terms.23.The notion of a sexual “orientation”has been deftly called into question bybell hooks in Feminist Theory:From Margin to Center(Boston:South EndPress,1984).She claims that it is a reification that falsely signals on open-ness to all members of the sex that is designated as the object of desire.Although she disputes the term because it puts into question the autono-my of the person described,I would emphasize that “orientations”them-selves are rarely,if ever,fixed.Obviously,they can shift through time andare open to cultural reformulations that are in no sense univocal.24.Heath,“Joan Riviere and the Masquerade,”pp.45–61.25.Stephen Heath points out that the situation that Riviere faced as an intel-lectual woman in competition for recognition by the psychoanalytic

establishment suggests strong parallels,if not an ultimate identification,with the analysand that she describes in the article.26.Jacqueline Rose,in Feminine Sexuality,eds.Mitchell and Rose,p.85.27.Jacqueline Rose,“Introduction-II”in Feminine Sexuality,eds.Mitchell andRose,p.44.28.Ibid.,p.55.29.Rose criticizes the work of Moustapha Safouan in particular for failing tounderstand the incommensurability of the symbolic and the real.See his La sexualité féminine dans la doctrine freudienne (Paris:Éditions de Seuil,1976).I am indebted to Elizabeth Weed for discussing the anti-developmental impetus in Lacan with me.30.See Friedrich Nietzsche,“First Essay,”in The Genealogy of Morals,trans.Walter Kaufmann (New York:Vintage,1969),for his analysis of slave-morality.Here as elsewhere in his writing,Nietzsche argues that God iscreated by the will-to-power as a self-debasing act and that the recoveryof the will-to-power from this construct of self-subjection is possiblethrough a reclaiming of the very creative powers that produced thethought of God and,paradoxically,of human powerlessness.Foucault’sDiscipline and Punishis clearly based on On the Genealogy of Morals,mostclearly the “Second Essay”as well as Nietzsche’s Daybreak.His distinctionbetween productive and juridical power is also clearly rooted inNietzsche’s analysis of the self-subjection of the will.In Foucault’s terms,the construction of the juridical law is the effect of productive power,but one in which productive power institutes its own concealment andsubordination.Foucault’s critique of Lacan (see History of Sexuality,VolumeI,An Introduction,trans.Robert Hurley [New York:Vintage,1980],p.81)and the repressive hypothesis generally centers on the overdeterminedstatus of the juridical law.31.Irigaray,Speculum of the Other Woman,pp.66–73.32.See Julia Kristeva Desire in Language:A Semiotic Approach to Literature and Art,ed.Leon Roudiez,trans.Thomas Gora,Alice Jardine,and Leon S.Roudiez (New York:Columbia University Press,1980);Soleil noir:Dépression et mélancolie(Paris:Gallimard,1987),translated as Black Sun:Depression and Melancholia,trans Leon Roudiez (New York:ColumbiaUniversity Press,1989).Kristeva’s reading of melancholy in this lattertext is based in part on the writings of Melanie Klein.Melancholy is the

matricidal impulse turned against the female subject and hence is linkedwith the problem of masochism.Kristeva appears to accept the notion ofprimary aggression in this text and to differentiate the sexes according tothe primary object of aggression and the manner in which they refuse tocommit the murders they most profoundly want to commit.The mascu-line position is thus understood as an externally directed sadism,whereasthe feminine is an internally directed masochism.For Kristeva,melan-choly is a “voluptuous sadness”that seems tied to the sublimated produc-tion of art.The highest form of that sublimation seems to center on thesuffering that is its origin.As a result,Kristeva ends the book,abruptlyand a bit polemically,extolling the great works of modernism that articu-late the tragic structure of human action and condemning the postmoderneffort to affirm,rather than to suffer,contemporary fragmentations of thepsyche.For a discussion of the role of melancholy in “MotherhoodAccording to Bellini,”see chapter 3,section i,of this text,“The BodyPolitics of Julia Kristeva.”33.See Freud,“The Ego and the Super-Ego (Ego-Ideal),”The Ego and the Id,trans.Joan Riviere,ed.James Strachey (New York:Norton,1960,original-ly published in 1923),for Freud’s discussion of mourning and melancholiaand their relation to ego and character formation as well as his discussionof alternative resolutions to the Oedipal conflict.I am grateful to PaulSchwaber for suggesting this chapter to me.Citations of “Mourning andMelancholia”refer to Sigmund Freud,General Psychological Theory,ed.PhilipRieff,(New York:MacMillan,1976),and will appear hereafter in the text.34.For an interesting discussion of “identification,”see Richard Wollheim’s“Identification and Imagination:The Inner Structure of a PsychicMechanism,”in Freud:A Collection of Critical Essays,ed.Richard Wollheim(Garden City:Anchor Press,1974),pp.172–195.35.Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok take exception to this conflation ofmourning and melancholia.See note 39 below.36.For a psychoanalytic theory that argues in favor of a distinction betweenthe super-ego as a punishing mechanism and the ego-ideal (as an idealiza-tion that serves a narcissistic wish),a distinction that Freud clearly doesnot make in The Ego and the Id,one might want to consult JanineChasseguet-Smirgell,The Ego-Ideal,A Psychological Essay on the Malady ofthe Ideal,trans.Paul Barrows,introduction by Christopher Lasch (New

York:Norton,1985),originally published as L’ideal du moi.Her textengages a naïve developmental model of sexuality that degrades homo-sexuality and regularly engages a polemic against feminism and Lacan.37.See Foucault,The History of Sexuality,Volume I,p.81.38.Roy Schafer,A New Language for Psycho-Analysis,(New Haven:YaleUniversity Press,1976),p.162.Also of interest are Schafer’s earlier dis-tinctions among various sorts of internalizations—introjection,incorpo-ration,identification—in Roy Schafer,Aspects of Internalization(New York:International Universities Press,1968).For a psychoanalytic history ofthe terms internalizationand identification,see W.W.Meissner,Internal-ization in Psychoanalysis(New York:International Universities Press,1968).39.This discussion of Abraham and Torok is based on “Deuil ou mélancholie,introjecter-incorporer,réalité métapsychologique et fantasme,”inL’Écorce et le noyau,(Paris:Flammarion,1987) translated as The Shell andthe Kernel:Renewals of Psychoanalysis,ed.,trans.,and with intro byNicholas T.Rand (Chicago:University of Chicago Press,1994).Part ofthis discussion is also to be found in English as Nicolas Abraham andMaria Torok,“Introjection-Incorporation:Mourning or Melancholia,”inPsychoanalysis in France,eds.Serge Lebovici and Daniel Widlocher (NewYork:International University Press,1980),pp.3–16.See also by thesame authors,“Notes on the Phantom:A Complement to Freud’sMetapsychology,”in The Trial(s) of Psychoanalysis,ed.Francoise Meltzer(Chicago:University of Chicago Press,1987),pp.75–80;and “A Poeticsof Psychoanalysis:‘The Lost Object-Me,’”Substance,Vol.43,1984,pp.3–18.40.Irigaray,Speculum of the Other Woman,p.68.41.See Schafer,A New Language for Psychoanalysis,p.177.In this and in his ear-lier work,Aspects of Internalization,Schaefer makes clear that the tropesof internalized spaces are phantasmatic constructions,but not processes.This clearly coincides in an interesting way with the thesis put forwardby Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok that “Incorporation is merely afantasy that reassures the ego”(“Introjection-Incorporation,”p.5).42.Clearly,this is the theoretical foundation of Monique Wittig’s The LesbianBody,trans.Peter Owen (New York:Avon,1976),which suggests that theheterosexualized female body is compartmentalized and rendered sexu-

ally unresponsive.The dismembering and remembering process of thatbody through lesbian love-making performs the “inversion”that revealsthe so-called integrated body as fully disintegrated and deeroticized andthe “literally”disintegrated body as capable of sexual pleasure throughoutthe surfaces of the body.Significantly,there are no stable surfaces onthese bodies,for the political principle of compulsory heterosexuality isunderstood to determine what counts as a whole,completed,andanatomically discrete body.Wittig’s narrative (which is at once an anti-narrative) brings those culturally constructed notions of bodily integrityinto question.43.This notion of the surface of the body as projected is partially addressedby Freud’s own concept of “the bodily ego.”Freud’s claim that “the ego is first and foremost a bodily ego”(The Ego and the Id,p.16) suggests that there is a concept of the body that determines ego-development.Freud continues the above sentence:“[the body] is not merely a surfaceentity,but is itself the projection of a surface.”For an interesting dis-cussion of Freud’s view,see Richard Wollheim,“The bodily ego,”inPhilosophical Essays on Freud,eds.Richard Wollheim and James Hopkins(Cambridge:Cambridge University Press,1982).For a provocativeaccount of “the skin ego,”which,unfortunately,does not consider theimplications of its account for the sexed body,see Didier Anzieu,Le moi-peau(Paris:Bordas,1985),published in English as The Skin Ego:APsychoanalytic Theory of the Self,trans.Chris Turner (New Haven:YaleUniversity Press,1989).44.See chapter 2,n.4.Hereafter page references to this essay will appear inthe text.45.See Gayle Rubin,“Thinking Sex:Notes for a Radical Theory of thePolitics of Sexuality,”in Pleasure and Danger,pp.267–319.Rubin’s presen-tation on power and sexuality at the 1979 conference on Simone deBeauvoir’s The Second Sexoccasioned an important shift in my own think-ing about the constructed status of lesbian sexuality.46.See (or,rather,don’t see) Joseph Shepher,ed.,Incest:A Biosocial View(London:Acadaemic Press,1985) for a deterministic account of incest.47.See Michele Z.Rosaldo,“The Use and Abuse of Anthropology:Reflec-tions on Feminism and Cross-Cultural Understanding,”Signs:Journal ofWomen in Culture and Society,Vol.5,No.3,1980.

46.“The Site of Action,”p.135.In this essay,Wittig distinguishes between a“first”and “second”contract within society:The first is one of radical rec-iprocity between speaking subjects who exchange words that “guarantee”the entire and exclusive disposition of language to everyone”(135);thesecond contract is one in which words operate to exert a force of domi-nation over others,indeed,to deprive others of the right and socialcapacity for speech.In this “debased”form of reciprocity,Wittig argues,individuality itself is erased through being addressed in a language thatprecludes the hearer as a potential speaker.Wittig concludes the essaywith the following:“the paradise of the social contract exists only in lit-erature,where the tropisms,by their violence,are able to counter anyreduction of the ‘I’to a common denominator,to tear open the closelywoven material of the commonplaces,and to continually prevent theirorganization into a system of compulsory meaning”(139).47.Monique Wittig,Les Guérillères,trans.David LeVay (New York:Avon,1973),originally published under the same title (Paris:Éditions duMinuit,1969).48.Wittig,“The Mark of Gender,”p.9.49.In “On the Social Contract,”a paper presented at Columbia University in1987 (in The Straight Mind and Other Essays [Boston:Beacon Press,1992],pp.33–45),Wittig places her own theory of a primary linguisticcontract in terms of Rousseau’s theory of the social contract.Althoughshe is not explicit in this regard,it appears that she understands the preso-cial (preheterosexual) contract as a unity of the will—that is,as a generalwill in Rousseau’s romantic sense.For an interesting use of her theory,seeTeresa de Lauretis,“Sexual Indifference and Lesbian Representation”inTheatre Journal,Vol.40,No.2 (May 1988) and “The Female Body andHeterosexual Presumption,”in Semiotica,Vol.3–4,No.67,1987,pp.259–279.50.Wittig,“On the Social Contract.”51.See Wittig,“The Straight Mind,”and “One is Not Born a Woman.”52.Wittig,“On the Social Contract,”pp.40–41.53.Wittig,“The Straight Mind,”and “On the Social Contract.”54.Michel Foucault,“Nietzsche,Genealogy,History,”in Language,Counter-Memory,Practice:Selected Essays and Interviews by Michel Foucault,trans.Donald F.Bouchard and Sherry Simon,ed.Donald F.Bouchard (Ithaca:
