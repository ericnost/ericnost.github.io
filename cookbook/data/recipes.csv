johnny cakes w/ maple syrup,Breakfast,Kentucky,fall,No,,"From: The Kentucky Housewife, Lettice Bryan, 1839, p. 315cornmeallukewarm water or buttermilkbuttersaltmaple syrupMake a thin dough of sifted Indian meal [corn meal] and lukewarm water or sweet milk (buttermilk), adding a teaspoonful of salt, and a large spoonful of butter to each quart of meal. Work it well, as Indian meal, in whatever way it is prepared, should be worked thoroughly. Having ready a piece of board planed smooth, wet it with water, and put on a cake of the dough about three quarters of an inch thick, make it smooth and even round the edges, brush it over with sweet cream, and brown it lightly before a clear fire, propping it on one edge by setting something behind it, to support it. Then run the blade of a knife or a sewing thread between the bread and board, to loose it turn it over, brown the other side in the same manner, first moistening it with sweet cream, and then cut it across in small cakes, split them, lay a slice of firm butter on one half of each piece, put them together again, and send them immediately to the table.Translation: get some corn meal (maybe a couple of cups), and mix it with some water or buttermilk, as well as some melted butter, till you get a moist but not sticky dough. Now work that dough! Grab some of the dough, enough to make a patty three quarters of an inch thick (think biscuit size, maybe smaller), smooth it out, brush some of the buttermilk on it, and put it on a hot griddle. The recipe is having you make all the dough at once, but you should just make one patty or cake at a time, like you would pancakes. Brown them, take em off the griddle, and butter them up! DonÍt forget to serve it with a sweet topping. We like maple syrup. But really, this recipe can be as simple as frying (in butter) a dough made from corn meal, water, and salt.",,#N/A,,,
corn mush with apples,Breakfast,Kentucky,fall,No,,"From: The Kentucky Housewife, Lettice Bryan, 1839, p. 316cornmealwaterapplesLike many other of our receipts, the process of making mush is quite plain and simple, yet it is often badly prepared and to the inexperienced some instructions are necessary. Sift some fine Indian meal [corn meal], make a smooth batter of it by stirring in a sufficiency of cold water. Having ready a pot of boiling water, throw in a handful of salt, and stir in your batter till it is like very thick soup. Boil it till of the proper consistence, and stir it frequently to prevent its being lumpy, and to keep it from burning at the bottom. Mush, made in this manner, will never fail to be thoroughly done and clear of lumps, which are two common failures. Cold mush maybe sliced and fried brown in butter. They are very good for breakfast.Translation: Though a tad condescending, Lettice is right: two common failures for corn mush are making it lumpy or undercooked. We say give this recipe a shot (adding apples in while you boil it to the proper ñconsistenceî), but you can also do this more simply, usually without ñfailureî: boil a couple of cups of water in a pot, add a cup or so of corn meal and as many apple chunks as you wish, simmer it and stir regularly till done.
