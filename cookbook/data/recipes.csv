Set aside.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, buckwheat flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the flour mixture. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut butter into flour, tossing flour to coat butter as you go. When largest pieces of butter are the size of peas, stop. (Alternatively, use a food processor for this step. If you use a food processor, mix flours and other dry ingredients together first, then add butter, and stop cutting when butter pieces are the size of lima beans.

If dough is round, slice into 8 as you would a pie, or use a 2-inch round cutter to make about 9 round scones (gather the scraps that remain and gently gather them into a round shape without kneading). If dough is square, make three horizontal cuts and three vertical cuts to create 9 square scones. Transfer scones to a plate and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 425_. Line a baking sheet with two layers of parchment paper. Place scones 1 inch apart on lined baking sheet. Brush with milk or cream and sprinkle lightly with sugar.

Dandelion Jelly,Lunch or snack or something else,Wisconsin,spring,No,,"2 heaping cups of fresh dandelion petals (see note below - you'll need to gather about 4 cups whole flowers)2 C boiling wter1/4 C well-strained, clear lemon juice4 C sugar3 oz liquid pectin (Certo)food coloring (optional)NOTE: Look for fully opened flowers, the bigger the better, for ease of preparation. Of course do NOT use any dandelions that have been sprayed with fertilizers or pesticides!We'll want just the dandelion petals for this - not the whole flower head. You'll get SOME green sepals (wow, botany class was a long time ago - hope that is the correct term!), and that's fine - but try to minimize the amount of ""green"" and have mainly yellow petals for your infusion. It works best if you hold the flower by the end near the stem, and trim the petals into a bowl or cup, with sharp kitchen scisscors. All the dandelion blossoms stained my fingers yellow!Pour boiling water over petals and let steep from 30 minutes to 24hours. I infused mine for about 2 hours - until the liquid was almost room temperature. Strain through a fine sieve, reserving the infusion. If not using immediately, refrigerate up to 24 hours.Place jars and lids on rack in pan or stockpot deep enough to cover them with about two inches of water, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, keeping the jars hot until ready to fill.To make the jelly, stir lemon juice (I actually used lime, because that's what I had on hand, and it worked quite nicely!) and sugar into reserved infusion in a two-quart nonreactive or stainless steel pan. Bring to a full rolling boil that cannot be stirred down. Add the liquid pectin and continue to boil two minutes, skimming any foam that may rise to the surface.As you can see - my infusion is NOT such a pretty color. I decided to add a bit of food coloring - about 20 drops of yellow. I've also seen people use green, but prefer the yellow. To me, Dandelion Jelly is honey-like, in flavor, so between that and the color of the blossoms, a yellow-colored jelly makes sense to me. :)Ladle quickly into jars to within about 1/8 inch from the top; clean each rim and threads of the jar as it's filled, and place flat lid and ring on each before filling the next.

In a deep stock pot or pressure cooker, cover the jars with enough water so they are completely covered. Bring to a boil, and sanitize for 10 minutes. Turn off heat and remove jars, seals, and lids.

With the remaining cabbage, shred in a food processor or on a box shredder. In a large mixing bowl, combine shredded cabbage and ginger.In a blender, blend 4 cups of water with miso paste until smooth. Stir into bowl with shredded cabbage until well mixed. Divide cabbage and liquids between the cooled, sterilized glass jars. Use a wooden spoon to tightly pack in the cabbage. Leave at least 2 inches of room at the top of each jar (it will expand as it ferments). Tightly roll up the outer cabbage leaves and place them inside the jars to fill the 2-inch spaces. Wipe the outer neck of the jars clean with hot water to clean up any spillage. Screw lids tightly onto jars.To ferment: Place jars in a cool, dark spot in the pantry for 5 days. The room temperature should be 65_F to 70_F. If it is slightly colder, wrap a towel around each jar. Bubbling in the jars is a sign that the jars are fermenting properly.

Slowly warm olive oil in the pan. Add chopped onion, saut_ for a few minutes until the onion begins to soften. Add garlic and continue to saut_ till mixture is fragrant.Add the bell pepper, saut_ for 5-7 minutes over medium until softened.Add tomatoes and tomato paste to pan, stir till blended. Add spices and sugar, stir well, and allow mixture to simmer over medium heat for 5-7 minutes till it starts to reduce. At this point, you can taste the mixture and spice it according to your preferences. Add salt and pepper to taste, more sugar for a sweeter sauce, or more cayenne pepper for a spicier shakshuka (be careful with the cayenne... it is extremely spicy!).Crack the eggs, one at a time, directly over the tomato mixture, making sure to space them evenly over the sauce. I usually place 4-5 eggs around the outer edge and 1 in the center. The eggs will cook ""over easy"" style on top of the tomato sauce.Cover the pan. Allow mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked and the sauce has slightly reduced. Keep an eye on the skillet to make sure that the sauce doesn't reduce too much, which can lead to burning.Some people prefer their shakshuka eggs more runny. If this is your preference, let the sauce reduce for a few minutes before cracking the eggs on top-- then, cover the pan and cook the eggs to taste.Garnish with the chopped parsley, if desired. Shakshuka can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. For breakfast, serve with warm crusty bread or pita that can be dipped into the sauce (if youÍre gluten-intolerant or celebrating Passover, skip the bread). For dinner, serve with a green side salad for a light, easy meal.",,http://theshiksa.com/2010/07/28/summer-2010-travel-blog-shakshuka/,yes,no,yes

Pozole de Jalisco,Supper,Wisconsin,fall,Yes,,"From: The Cuisines of Mexico Revised Edition, Diane Kennedy, 1972 (1986), p. 162.1 32 oz can of cooked hominy1 _ lbs pork, tenderloin or butt without bone_ pigês head (not more than 3 pounds)(optional)1 pound pork neck bonesCold water to cover2 cups chiles de arbol1 _ tbsp. saltFor serving:Finely chopped onionSliced radishesFinely shredded lettuceWedges of limeThe salsa picanteCut the pork into large serving pieces and put it, with the head and bones, in cold water to soak overnight. Change the water as often as is practical.Cover the chiles with cold water and let them soak overnight.On serving day:If using dried then soaked hominy: cover the hominy with the cold, unsalted water. Bring to a boil and cook, uncovered, over a brisk flame until it opens up like a flower _ about 1 hour. DO NOT STIR THE CORN during this time, but, if necessary, skim the surface of the water from time to time.Cover the head with cold, unsalted water. Bring to a boil, then lower the flame and let it simmer, uncovered, until the flesh can be rmoved from the bone _ but do not overcook _ about 1 hour. Set it aside to cool.When the head is cool enough to handle, remove all the meat, skin, etc. and cut it into serving pieces. Cut the ear up (there should be a piece for everyone) and set the eye aside for the honored guest. Add the pieces of head, and the broth in which it was cooked, to the corn in its pot.Add the salt. Place the meat on top of the corn and let the pozole cook, uncovered, over a gentle flame for about 4 hours. Throughout the cooking time skim the fat from the surface. Keep some water boiling in a kettle at the side to add to the liquid in the pan. On no account should cold water be added. The liquid should be maintained at almost the same level from start to finish.Salsa picante: blend the chiles with the water in which they were soaking. Strain the sauce through a sieve. Do not add salt. To serve: Place the meat onto a serving dish so it can be divided up more easily and everyone can have the part that he likes best. Serve the pozole with the corn in large, deep bowls, with the following small side dishes to which everyone can help himself: the salsa picante, onion, radishes, lettuce, and lime.Note: Pozole de Jalisco is not served with oregano, as it is in the neighboring state of michoacan. The chili used for the sauce in Jalisco is chilie de arbol, a long, thin, dried, bright red chili.The pozole should be cooked with plenty of salt; you may need to add more just before the end of the cooking time.Only those who know the wonderful flavor and consistency of a soup made with the specially prepared corn will appreciate ho hard it is for me to say: if you canêt get the real corn, use canned. In that case, cook the had first, add the rest of the meat, and an hour later add the drained canned hominy. ",,Kennedy,no,no,yes

Literally it means: beans cooked in the way the lady charro would prepare them (the churros are the elegant horsemen of Mexico).The green chilies and coriander give the beans a unique and interesting flavor, making them a perfecet complement to the simple broiled meats so popular in Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo Leon: the agujas (ribs of beef) and cabrito (kid) cooked over wood or charcoal. There are many variations of this recipe and the very similar firjoles rancheros and firjoles fronterizos.Monterrey is an important center for the beer industry - by adding 1/3 small bottle of beer to the recipe they become frijoles borrachos, a very lusty plateful.Cut the pork rind into small squares and put them, together with the bans, onion, and garlic, into the bean pot.Add the water and bring toa boil. Lower the flame, cover the pot, and let the beans cook gently until they are tender _ about 1 _ hours. Add the salt and cook them, uncovered, for another 15 minutes.Cut the bacon into small pieces and cook it gently in the lard until it is slightly browned.Peel, seed, and chop the tomatoes; strain the seeds and add the juice. Add the tomatoes together with the rest of the ingredients [including the dandelion greens]. Cook the mixture over a fairly high flame for about 10 minutes, until it is well seasoned. Add the tomato mixture to the beans and let them cook together, uncovered, over a low flame for about 15 minutes.Serve in small individual bowls with broiled meats, or add ome more liquid and serve as a soup.You should e able to buy pork rind by the pound from the butchers specializing in pork. If not, the shoulder of pork recommended for so many of the recipes here usually has the rind left on.

No one is quite sure what it is, but everyone eats it with unmitigated pleasure.Bake the well-pricked pie shell ina  400F oven for just 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350F. In a mixer bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the flour and beat again. With the beater running slowly, pour in the buttermilk. Add the vanilla, bourbon, and melted butter; blend. Pour the filling into the partially baked pie shell and dust the surface with nutmeg. Bake until the filling just sets, about 20 minutes, then turn off the oven and leave the pie in for 10 minutes longer. Remove the pie to a rack; it will continue to set as it cools. (Custard pies should not bake too long or the custard will curdle.)",,Heartland,Yes,No,No

Coat a 9_5-inch loaf pan with olive oil or a nonstick cooking spray. If yours is old and you’re nervous about the cake sticking, it cannot hurt to line yours with a fitted rectangle of parchment paper.In a large bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.

Work it well, as Indian meal, in whatever way it is prepared, should be worked thoroughly. Having ready a piece of board planed smooth, wet it with water, and put on a cake of the dough about three quarters of an inch thick, make it smooth and even round the edges, brush it over with sweet cream, and brown it lightly before a clear fire, propping it on one edge by setting something behind it, to support it. Then run the blade of a knife or a sewing thread between the bread and board, to loose it turn it over, brown the other side in the same manner, first moistening it with sweet cream, and then cut it across in small cakes, split them, lay a slice of firm butter on one half of each piece, put them together again, and send them immediately to the table.Translation: get some corn meal (maybe a couple of cups), and mix it with some water or buttermilk, as well as some melted butter, till you get a moist but not sticky dough. Now work that dough! Grab some of the dough, enough to make a patty three quarters of an inch thick (think biscuit size, maybe smaller), smooth it out, brush some of the buttermilk on it, and put it on a hot griddle. The recipe is having you make all the dough at once, but you should just make one patty or cake at a time, like you would pancakes. Brown them, take em off the griddle, and butter them up! Donêt forget to serve it with a sweet topping. We like maple syrup. But really, this recipe can be as simple as frying (in butter) a dough made from corn meal, water, and salt.",,#N/A,,,

Sift some fine Indian meal [corn meal], make a smooth batter of it by stirring in a sufficiency of cold water. Having ready a pot of boiling water, throw in a handful of salt, and stir in your batter till it is like very thick soup. Boil it till of the proper consistence, and stir it frequently to prevent its being lumpy, and to keep it from burning at the bottom. Mush, made in this manner, will never fail to be thoroughly done and clear of lumps, which are two common failures. Cold mush maybe sliced and fried brown in butter. They are very good for breakfast.Translation: Though a tad condescending, Lettice is right: two common failures for corn mush are making it lumpy or undercooked. We say give this recipe a shot (adding apples in while you boil it to the proper _consistenceî), but you can also do this more simply, usually without _failureî: boil a couple of cups of water in a pot, add a cup or so of corn meal and as many apple chunks as you wish, simmer it and stir regularly till done.

Maple bourbon glazed parsnips,Lunch or snack or something else,Kentucky,winter,No,,"From: Heartland: The Best of the Old and the New from Midwest Kitchens, Marcia Adams, 1991, p. 76.2 lbs parsnips2 tbsp butter_ cup maple syrup_ tsp dry mustard_ tsp dried marjoramSalt and pepperThis white root vegetable that is first cousin to the carrot has long been popular with Midwestern country cooks. Parsnps are an exceedingly hardy vegetable and will winter over in the ground through even the harshest of Iowa seasons. In fact, frost or very cold weather improves their flavor, changing their starch content to sugar. Ideally the parsnips should all be the same size so they will cook eevenly in your pan, but Mother Nature rarely cooperates. Cut the larger parnsips into halves or fourths, and if they are really large, cut out the cores, for they will be woody.The sauce, with its hint of marjoram, cooks down to a pleasing glaze.Preheat the oven to 400F. Peel the parsnips and slice them approximately 7/8 inch thick. Transfer the parnsips to a medium saucepan with water to cover. Bring to ab oil and cook, covered, for about 5 minutes, or until just tender _ donêt let them get mushy. Drain the parsnips and transfer to a greased 1 quart casserole.In a small saucepan, combine the rest of the ingredients and bring to a boil over low heat. Pour over the parsnips and bake uncovered for 40 minutes, or until the sauce is cooked down and the parsnfips begin to brown.",,Heartland,Yes,No,Yes

It is slightly picante, and has a predominating flavor of epazote. This is just one of many variations of this recipe. Have the butcher cut the meat and bones into serving pieces. Cover them with the water, add the salt and bring to ab oil. Lower the lfame and simmer the meat, uncovered, until it is tender _ about 50 minutes.Meanwhile prepare the chiles. Heat the comal and toast the chiles well, turning them frequently so that they do not burn. When they are cool enough to handle, remove the seeds and veins _ do not soak them _ and put them into the blender. Blend the chiles with the rest of the ingredients until smooth.Heat the oil and fry the sauce for about 5 minutes. Add it to the meat in the pan.Clean and trim the squash and cut them into halves, then into fours lengthwise. Trim the beans and cut them into halves. Cut the corn into 6 pieces. Cut the chayote open and remove the core, then cut into 1/4-inch wedges. Skin the potatoes and cut them into cubes.When the meat is tender, add the vegetables and cook the mole slowly, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are cooked. Add the epazote about 5 minutes before the mole is ready and add salt as necessary.Serve in large, deep soup bowls, with hot tortillas, wedges of lime, and finely chopped onion on the side. Traditionally, two acid, green prickly pears called zoconostles are cut up and boiled with the meat. Though there is really no substitute, the acidity of the lime with help. The epazote growing wild here is not as strong as the Mexican plant; you will, therefore, need to use 3 large sprigs. Do not soak the chiles before blending htme, or they will lose the flavor and piquancy needed in this sort of dish. Some Mexicans prefer to have the vegetables cooked separately and then added to the mole; otherwise, they say, it is too sweet. If you like a more pungent chili flavor, then use all chiles pasillas, or chiles guajillos, and do not use the anchos.",,Kennedy,No,No,Yes

Janssonês Temptation (potatoes with anchovies),Supper,Kentucky,winter,No,,"From: Heartland: The Best of the Old and the New from Midwest Kitchens, Marcia Adams, 1991, p. 14.3 tbsp butter2 medium onions, chooped1 3-oz can anchovies, drained, and mashed with a fork1 cup half-and-half, approximately5 medium potatoes, peeled and thinly cut, like finely cut French friesFreshly ground black pepperScandinavian immigrants tended to set up their own societies in the new country, almost to the exclusion of outsiders. Today Swedish neclaves remain in several Midwestern states, including Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, as well as Illinois. Bishop Hill in Illinoi was settled in 1846 by a group of religious colonists, called Janssonists after their leader Erik Jansson.This potato dish is familiar to Scandinavians but deserves wider exposure. Anchovies give these creamy potatoes a most delectable but unidentifiable flavor. It is a traditional smorgasbord offering and would be ideal for any buffet table, for it is good served at room temperature.Preheat the oven to 350F. In a medium skillet, melt the butter; add the onions and saute until golden, about 10 minutes. In a small saucepan, combine the anchovies and 1 cup half-and-half, and cook together over medium heat until the mixture bubbles around the edges of the pan.Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish and layer the potatoes and onions in it, grinding a bit of black pepper over each layer. Pour the warm cream mixture over all, distributing the anchovy bits equally among the potatoes. Add more half-and-half, if necessary so the cream barely covers the potatoes.

Put them to fry over low heat in a large, heavy sauteuse or skillet with a bit of oil or butter. When the pieces are golden brown, remove them and put them aside. In the same cooking fat, place the carrots and chopped onions. Keep the heat between medium and low, and allow them to cook, stirring regularly to avoid overbrowning, for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the vegetables, put them aside and replace them with the chicken pieces, previously salted. Cook the chicken over a somewhat higher heat until gently browned on all sides, spring with flour and continue to cook, turning the pieces as necessary. Return the saut_ed onions and carrots ot the pan. When the flour has cooked for a few minutes, pour in the brandy, carefully set it alight and stir. When the flames have died, add the wine and raise the heat. Stir the chicken pieces and move them around until the liquid comes to a boil.At this point, if the skillet is already overfull of the hciken, or if perhaps you have had to use two skillets and both seem too full to permit adding the vegetables, keep the carrots and onions aside and add them later when the chickens goes into the oven dish.Transfer the chicken pieces and vegetables to an earthenware, copper or enameled cast-iron casserole with a lid. Stir and scarpe the first pan with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve the fryin adherents, then pour the liquid over the chicken pieces. If they are not completely covered, add enough wine, water or good stock (water is better than indifferent stock) to barely, but entirely, cover them. Add the bouquet garni (or simply sprinkle with thyme, and add the bay leaf and parsley sprigs untied). Put to cook, covered, in the oven, regulating the heat so that the sauce hardly simmers. The length of cooking time depends on the birdês age and –past” _ from 30 to 45 minutes for a fryer that has never exercised to 1 _ hours for a 10-month-old rooster, and an hour loner still for one that may be too old to have a fine flesh but will produce a marvelous sauce.Meanwhile cook the boiling onions, seasoned, in butter over very low heat, shaking the pan from time to time, for 20 to 30 minutes. Kepp them covered and avoid browning them; if the sauce pan is not heavy enough, you may have to use a fireproof pad over the heat source. Remove the oninos when they are done and use the same pany to fry the mushrooms. Trim the mushroom stems and cut the caps into two or four pieces (if they are small, leave them whole). Toss them in butter over high heat for 2 or 3 minutes; season with salt and freshly ground pepper.Transfer the hciken pieces and the carrots to a platter. Pass the cooking liquid through a fine sieve into a saucepan, using a pestle to work the residue. Discard the remains of the bouquet garni. In the saucepan, skim as much fat from the surface of the liquid as pssible and bring it to a boil, then position the saucepan over the heat so as to permit its contents to simmer only on one side. Carefully skim off all fat and impurities as they surface over the next 30 minutes or so. If, at this point, the sauce is still too thin, turn up the heat to create a fast boil, stirring constantly until you achieve the right consistency.Put the hciken pieces and the carrots back in the oven dish, distribute the garnish (saut_ed mushrooms, glazed boilin onions, and fired pork sections) on top and pour over the sauce. Cover and return to the oven to simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes.Brown the triangles of bread in butter over low heat until golden and cirsp. (They may be prepared ahead of time and rewarmed in the oven.)To serve, place the chicken pieces more or less symmetrically on a large, warmed platter. Rub the crouton tirangles with the clove of garlic, dip a corner of each triangle in the sauce, then in the chopped parsley, and arrange them around the edge of the platter, parslied tips pointing out.

A low temperature is needed, around 250F for 8 hours of baking; although they should not be stirred, they do need attention ocassionally, for they need to be kept covered with boiling water at all times. The beanpot itself needs to be kept covered until the last hour of baking; then, remove cover so the beans will brown on top.Are you longin for baked beans, yet salt pork is eliminated from your diet? Then do exactly as given above, only in place of _ pound of salt pork, use 4 tablespoons cookin oil per pound dry beans, or 2 tablespoons cooking oil per cup of dry beans.

Vegan Michigan Cassoulet with Sweet Potatoes and Tempeh,Supper,Kentucky,winter,No,,"Adapted from: Heartland: The Best of the Old and the New from Midwest Kitchens, Marcia Adams, 1991, p. 110.1 lb dried Michigan navy beans1 celery stalk2 bay leavesHandful of parsley sprigs_ cup chopped celery_ cup chopped onion_ cup chopped carrot1 cup chopped sweet potatoes_ - 1 lb tempeh, cut into squares1 tsp minced garlicOlive oil1 14-oz can tomatoes, drained_ cup dry white wine2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley_ tsp dried thyme_ tsp dried savory_ tsp freshly ground black pepper2 thick slices French bread2 tsp finely minced fresh parsleyEven the plainest of Midwestern cooks hs been making a stripped-down version of cassoulet for years _ what she calls ham and beans. And generally it is a rather good dish.The beloved French provincial casserole of white beans and assorted meats and either duck or goose requires several daysê labor and umpteen mixing boards; this simplified version uses a slow cooker and rquires no watching. Start the beans by soaking them the night before cooking, and be sure to save the bean cooking liquid.Place the beans in a large kettle with water to cover; soak overnight. The next morning, add the celery stalk, 1 bay leaf, and parsley to the beans, cover and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes. Drain, reserving 2 cups of the cooking liquid. Discard the celery and herbs and transfer the beans to the slow-cooker. Cook the chopped celery, onion, carrot, and arlic in the live oil over medium heat until the onion begins to brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to the cooker. Then add some more olive oil and start the sweet potatoes. When they start to soften, add the tempeh and tomatoes, wine, parsley and seasonsings. Add to the bean mixture in the cooker. Mix gently to avoid breaking up the beans. Add enough of the reserved cooking liquid to come within 1 inch of the top of the beans.Cover, turn temperature to high, and cook for 1 hour. Turn to low and continue cooking for 3 to 4 hours; do not stir while cooking. The cooking time is imprecise, for this depends on the age of the beans, their growing locale, and even the hardness of the water. Do not let beans overcook and get mushy. If necessary, add more of the reserved cooking water to keep the water level at 1 inch below the top of the beans.Meanwhile, toast the bread in a flat plan in a 160F oven for 2 hours. Break into large pieces and process until fine crumbs are formed _ you need a scant _ cup. Stir in the parsley. About 30 minutes before the beans are done, sprinkle the crumbs on top and then, using a wooden spoon, gently push them deep down into the beans to thicken the juices. When the beans have reached the desired texture, turn off the cooker. Serve hot.",,Heartland,Yes,Yes,No
