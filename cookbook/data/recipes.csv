Once the milk mixture comes to a boil, gradually add the cornmeal while continually whisking. Once all of the cornmeal has been incorporated, decrease the heat to low and cover. Remove lid and whisk frequently, every 3 to 4 minutes, to prevent grits from sticking or forming lumps; make sure to get into corners of pot when whisking. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until mixture is creamy.Remove from the heat, add the pepper and butter, and whisk to combine.

Buttermilk Pancakes,Breakfast,Wisconsin,spring,Yes,data/img/bittman.jpg,"2 cups all-purpose flour1/2 tsp baking soda1/4 tsp salt1 tbsp sugar (optional)2 eggs1 1/2 to 2 cups buttermilk (the easy way to do this is to sour milk. Add 2 tbsp white vinegar and let sit about 10 minutes until thick and lumpy)2 tbsp butterHeat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat while you make the batter.Mix the dry ingredients together. Beat the eggs into 1 1/2 cups of the buttermilk, then stir in the 2 tbsp melted cooled butter. Gently stir this mixture into the dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten the flour; don't worry about a few lumps. The batter should be pourable, or nearly so; if it's too thick, add a little more milk. If your skillet or griddle is nonstick, you can cook the pancakes without any butter. Otherwise, use a tsp or two oof butter or oil each time you add batter. When the the butter foam subsides or the oil shimmers, ladle batter onto the griddle or skillet, making any size pancakes you like. Adjust the heat as necessary; usually the first batch will require higher heat than subsequent batches. The idea is to brown the bottom in 2 to 4 minutes without burning it. Flip when bubbles rise to the surface of the pancakes and the bottoms are cooked; they won't hold together well until they're ready.",,Bittman,yes,no,no

Set aside.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, buckwheat flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the flour mixture. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut butter into flour, tossing flour to coat butter as you go. When largest pieces of butter are the size of peas, stop.

Dandelion Jelly,Lunch or snack or something else,Wisconsin,spring,No,,"2 heaping cups of fresh dandelion petals (see note below - you'll need to gather about 4 cups whole flowers)2 C boiling wter1/4 C well-strained, clear lemon juice4 C sugar3 oz liquid pectin (Certo)food coloring (optional)NOTE: Look for fully opened flowers, the bigger the better, for ease of preparation. Of course do NOT use any dandelions that have been sprayed with fertilizers or pesticides!We'll want just the dandelion petals for this - not the whole flower head. You'll get SOME green sepals (wow, botany class was a long time ago - hope that is the correct term!), and that's fine - but try to minimize the amount of ""green"" and have mainly yellow petals for your infusion. It works best if you hold the flower by the end near the stem, and trim the petals into a bowl or cup, with sharp kitchen scisscors. All the dandelion blossoms stained my fingers yellow!Pour boiling water over petals and let steep from 30 minutes to 24hours. I infused mine for about 2 hours - until the liquid was almost room temperature. Strain through a fine sieve, reserving the infusion. If not using immediately, refrigerate up to 24 hours.Place jars and lids on rack in pan or stockpot deep enough to cover them with about two inches of water, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, keeping the jars hot until ready to fill.To make the jelly, stir lemon juice (I actually used lime, because that's what I had on hand, and it worked quite nicely!) and sugar into reserved infusion in a two-quart nonreactive or stainless steel pan. Bring to a full rolling boil that cannot be stirred down. Add the liquid pectin and continue to boil two minutes, skimming any foam that may rise to the surface.As you can see - my infusion is NOT such a pretty color. I decided to add a bit of food coloring - about 20 drops of yellow. I've also seen people use green, but prefer the yellow. To me, Dandelion Jelly is honey-like, in flavor, so between that and the color of the blossoms, a yellow-colored jelly makes sense to me. :)Ladle quickly into jars to within about 1/8 inch from the top; clean each rim and threads of the jar as it's filled, and place flat lid and ring on each before filling the next.

In a deep stock pot or pressure cooker, cover the jars with enough water so they are completely covered. Bring to a boil, and sanitize for 10 minutes. Turn off heat and remove jars, seals, and lids. Allow everything to cool while preparing the salad.To prep sauerkraut: Remove six outer leaves from the cabbage and set aside, intact. With the remaining cabbage, shred in a food processor or on a box shredder. In a large mixing bowl, combine shredded cabbage and ginger.In a blender, blend 4 cups of water with miso paste until smooth. Stir into bowl with shredded cabbage until well mixed. Divide cabbage and liquids between the cooled, sterilized glass jars. Use a wooden spoon to tightly pack in the cabbage. Leave at least 2 inches of room at the top of each jar (it will expand as it ferments). Tightly roll up the outer cabbage leaves and place them inside the jars to fill the 2-inch spaces. Wipe the outer neck of the jars clean with hot water to clean up any spillage. Screw lids tightly onto jars.To ferment: Place jars in a cool, dark spot in the pantry for 5 days. The room temperature should be 65_F to 70_F. If it is slightly colder, wrap a towel around each jar. Bubbling in the jars is a sign that the jars are fermenting properly. After 5 days, remove the outer cabbage leaves and discard. Transfer the jars to the refrigerator (to slow down the fermentation process).

Baba Ganoush,Lunch or snack or something else,Wisconsin,summer,No,,"3 medium Italian eggplants (about 2 pounds total)3 medium cloves of garlic, minced2 tablespoons juice from 1 lemon, plus more as desired3 tablespoons tahini1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leavesKosher salt1. If using a gas burner or grill (recommended): Preheat a gas or coal grill to medium heat and place eggplants directly over heat source. Cook, turning occasionally with tongs, until completely tender and well charred on all sides, 30 to 40 minutes. Wrap with foil and let rest 15 minutes. Continue to step 3.2. If using the broiler: Adjust rack to 6 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler to high. Place eggplant on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Broil, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides and completely tender, about 1 hour. Eggplants should be very, very tender when cooked. Test near the stem and bottom ends. If a toothpick or skewer meets any resistance, continue cooking. (See note above.) Remove from oven and gather up foil, crimping it around the eggplants to form a sealed package. Let the eggplants rest for 15 minutes. Continue to step 3.3. Open foil package. Working one eggplant at a time, use a sharp paring knife to slit it open lengthwise. Carefully scoop out soft flesh with a large spoon and transfer to a strainer set in a large bowl. Once all eggplant is scooped, pick out any stray bits of skin and blackened flesh and discard.4. Transfer eggplant to a salad spinner, distributing it evenly around the perimeter. Spin gently until all excess moisture is extracted. Discard all drippings, wipe out bowl. and return eggplant to bowl.5. Add garlic and lemon juice to eggplant and stir vigorously with a fork until eggplant breaks down into a rough paste, about 1 1/2 minutes. Stirring constantly and vigorously, add the tahini followed by the olive oil in a thin, steady stream. The mixture should become pale and creamy. Stir in parsley and season to taste with salt and more lemon juice if desired.6. Transfer to a serving bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and serve with warm pita bread or vegetables for dipping. Baba ganoush can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days.

Spinatsuppe,Supper,Wisconsin,fall,No,,"2 lbs fresh spinach2 quarts chicken stock3 tbsp butter2 tbsp flour1 tsp salt1/4 teaspoon white pepper1/8 tsp nutmeg2 hard-cooked eggs, slicedBring the 2 quarts of stock to a boil in a 3 to 4 quart saucepan and add the fresh or frozen chopped spinach. Simmer uncovered about 6-8 minutes, then pour the entire contents of the pan into a sieve set over a large bowl. Press down hard on the spinach with the back of a wooden spoon to extract all of its juices. Set the liquid aside in the bowl and chopp the cooked spinach very fine.Melt the 3 tbsp of butter in the saucepan. When the foam subsides, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the flour. With a wire whisk, beat the hot stock into this white roux a little at a time. Return the saucepan to the heat and, stirring it constantly, bring it to a boil. Then add the spinach. Season the soup wtih salt, pepper, and nutmeng. Half cover the pan and simmer the soup over low heat about 5 minutes longer. Stir occasionally. Garish each serving of the soup with a few slices of hard-cooked egg. On festive occasioins, such as Easter, spinatsuppe is often served with a stuffed egg half-floating in each soup bowl.

Slowly warm olive oil in the pan. Add chopped onion, saut_ for a few minutes until the onion begins to soften. Add garlic and continue to saut_ till mixture is fragrant.Add the bell pepper, saut_ for 5-7 minutes over medium until softened.Add tomatoes and tomato paste to pan, stir till blended. Add spices and sugar, stir well, and allow mixture to simmer over medium heat for 5-7 minutes till it starts to reduce. At this point, you can taste the mixture and spice it according to your preferences. Add salt and pepper to taste, more sugar for a sweeter sauce, or more cayenne pepper for a spicier shakshuka (be careful with the cayenne... it is extremely spicy!).Crack the eggs, one at a time, directly over the tomato mixture, making sure to space them evenly over the sauce. I usually place 4-5 eggs around the outer edge and 1 in the center. The eggs will cook ""over easy"" style on top of the tomato sauce.Cover the pan. Allow mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked and the sauce has slightly reduced. Keep an eye on the skillet to make sure that the sauce doesn't reduce too much, which can lead to burning.Some people prefer their shakshuka eggs more runny. If this is your preference, let the sauce reduce for a few minutes before cracking the eggs on top-- then, cover the pan and cook the eggs to taste.Garnish with the chopped parsley, if desired. Shakshuka can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. For breakfast, serve with warm crusty bread or pita that can be dipped into the sauce (if youêre gluten-intolerant or celebrating Passover, skip the bread). For dinner, serve with a green side salad for a light, easy meal.",,http://theshiksa.com/2010/07/28/summer-2010-travel-blog-shakshuka/,yes,no,yes

Pozole de Jalisco,Supper,Wisconsin,fall,Yes,,"From: The Cuisines of Mexico Revised Edition, Diane Kennedy, 1972 (1986), p. 162.1 32 oz can of cooked hominy1 _ lbs pork, tenderloin or butt without bone_ pigês head (not more than 3 pounds)(optional)1 pound pork neck bonesCold water to cover2 cups chiles de arbol1 _ tbsp. saltFor serving:Finely chopped onionSliced radishesFinely shredded lettuceWedges of limeThe salsa picanteCut the pork into large serving pieces and put it, with the head and bones, in cold water to soak overnight. Change the water as often as is practical.Cover the chiles with cold water and let them soak overnight.On serving day:If using dried then soaked hominy: cover the hominy with the cold, unsalted water. Bring to a boil and cook, uncovered, over a brisk flame until it opens up like a flower _ about 1 hour. DO NOT STIR THE CORN during this time, but, if necessary, skim the surface of the water from time to time.Cover the head with cold, unsalted water. Bring to a boil, then lower the flame and let it simmer, uncovered, until the flesh can be rmoved from the bone _ but do not overcook _ about 1 hour. Set it aside to cool.When the head is cool enough to handle, remove all the meat, skin, etc. and cut it into serving pieces. Cut the ear up (there should be a piece for everyone) and set the eye aside for the honored guest. Add the pieces of head, and the broth in which it was cooked, to the corn in its pot.Add the salt. Place the meat on top of the corn and let the pozole cook, uncovered, over a gentle flame for about 4 hours. Throughout the cooking time skim the fat from the surface. Keep some water boiling in a kettle at the side to add to the liquid in the pan. On no account should cold water be added. The liquid should be maintained at almost the same level from start to finish.Salsa picante: blend the chiles with the water in which they were soaking. Strain the sauce through a sieve. Do not add salt. To serve: Place the meat onto a serving dish so it can be divided up more easily and everyone can have the part that he likes best. Serve the pozole with the corn in large, deep bowls, with the following small side dishes to which everyone can help himself: the salsa picante, onion, radishes, lettuce, and lime.Note: Pozole de Jalisco is not served with oregano, as it is in the neighboring state of michoacan. The chili used for the sauce in Jalisco is chilie de arbol, a long, thin, dried, bright red chili.The pozole should be cooked with plenty of salt; you may need to add more just before the end of the cooking time.Only those who know the wonderful flavor and consistency of a soup made with the specially prepared corn will appreciate ho hard it is for me to say: if you canêt get the real corn, use canned. In that case, cook the had first, add the rest of the meat, and an hour later add the drained canned hominy. ",,Kennedy,no,no,yes

Work it well, as Indian meal, in whatever way it is prepared, should be worked thoroughly. Having ready a piece of board planed smooth, wet it with water, and put on a cake of the dough about three quarters of an inch thick, make it smooth and even round the edges, brush it over with sweet cream, and brown it lightly before a clear fire, propping it on one edge by setting something behind it, to support it. Then run the blade of a knife or a sewing thread between the bread and board, to loose it turn it over, brown the other side in the same manner, first moistening it with sweet cream, and then cut it across in small cakes, split them, lay a slice of firm butter on one half of each piece, put them together again, and send them immediately to the table.Translation: get some corn meal (maybe a couple of cups), and mix it with some water or buttermilk, as well as some melted butter, till you get a moist but not sticky dough. Now work that dough! Grab some of the dough, enough to make a patty three quarters of an inch thick (think biscuit size, maybe smaller), smooth it out, brush some of the buttermilk on it, and put it on a hot griddle. The recipe is having you make all the dough at once, but you should just make one patty or cake at a time, like you would pancakes. Brown them, take em off the griddle, and butter them up! Donêt forget to serve it with a sweet topping. We like maple syrup. But really, this recipe can be as simple as frying (in butter) a dough made from corn meal, water, and salt.",,#N/A,,,

Sift some fine Indian meal [corn meal], make a smooth batter of it by stirring in a sufficiency of cold water. Having ready a pot of boiling water, throw in a handful of salt, and stir in your batter till it is like very thick soup. Boil it till of the proper consistence, and stir it frequently to prevent its being lumpy, and to keep it from burning at the bottom. Mush, made in this manner, will never fail to be thoroughly done and clear of lumps, which are two common failures. Cold mush maybe sliced and fried brown in butter. They are very good for breakfast.Translation: Though a tad condescending, Lettice is right: two common failures for corn mush are making it lumpy or undercooked. We say give this recipe a shot (adding apples in while you boil it to the proper _consistence”), but you can also do this more simply, usually without _failure”: boil a couple of cups of water in a pot, add a cup or so of corn meal and as many apple chunks as you wish, simmer it and stir regularly till done.

Parsnps are an exceedingly hardy vegetable and will winter over in the ground through even the harshest of Iowa seasons. In fact, frost or very cold weather improves their flavor, changing their starch content to sugar. Ideally the parsnips should all be the same size so they will cook eevenly in your pan, but Mother Nature rarely cooperates. Cut the larger parnsips into halves or fourths, and if they are really large, cut out the cores, for they will be woody.The sauce, with its hint of marjoram, cooks down to a pleasing glaze.Preheat the oven to 400F.

It is slightly picante, and has a predominating flavor of epazote. This is just one of many variations of this recipe. Have the butcher cut the meat and bones into serving pieces. Cover them with the water, add the salt and bring to ab oil. Lower the lfame and simmer the meat, uncovered, until it is tender _ about 50 minutes.Meanwhile prepare the chiles. Heat the comal and toast the chiles well, turning them frequently so that they do not burn. When they are cool enough to handle, remove the seeds and veins _ do not soak them _ and put them into the blender. Blend the chiles with the rest of the ingredients until smooth.Heat the oil and fry the sauce for about 5 minutes. Add it to the meat in the pan.Clean and trim the squash and cut them into halves, then into fours lengthwise. Trim the beans and cut them into halves. Cut the corn into 6 pieces. Cut the chayote open and remove the core, then cut into 1/4-inch wedges. Skin the potatoes and cut them into cubes.When the meat is tender, add the vegetables and cook the mole slowly, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are cooked. Add the epazote about 5 minutes before the mole is ready and add salt as necessary.Serve in large, deep soup bowls, with hot tortillas, wedges of lime, and finely chopped onion on the side. Traditionally, two acid, green prickly pears called zoconostles are cut up and boiled with the meat. Though there is really no substitute, the acidity of the lime with help. The epazote growing wild here is not as strong as the Mexican plant; you will, therefore, need to use 3 large sprigs. Do not soak the chiles before blending htme, or they will lose the flavor and piquancy needed in this sort of dish. Some Mexicans prefer to have the vegetables cooked separately and then added to the mole; otherwise, they say, it is too sweet. If you like a more pungent chili flavor, then use all chiles pasillas, or chiles guajillos, and do not use the anchos.",,Kennedy,No,No,Yes

Janssonês Temptation (potatoes with anchovies),Supper,Kentucky,winter,No,,"From: Heartland: The Best of the Old and the New from Midwest Kitchens, Marcia Adams, 1991, p. 14.3 tbsp butter2 medium onions, chooped1 3-oz can anchovies, drained, and mashed with a fork1 cup half-and-half, approximately5 medium potatoes, peeled and thinly cut, like finely cut French friesFreshly ground black pepperScandinavian immigrants tended to set up their own societies in the new country, almost to the exclusion of outsiders. Today Swedish neclaves remain in several Midwestern states, including Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, as well as Illinois. Bishop Hill in Illinoi was settled in 1846 by a group of religious colonists, called Janssonists after their leader Erik Jansson.This potato dish is familiar to Scandinavians but deserves wider exposure. Anchovies give these creamy potatoes a most delectable but unidentifiable flavor. It is a traditional smorgasbord offering and would be ideal for any buffet table, for it is good served at room temperature.Preheat the oven to 350F. In a medium skillet, melt the butter; add the onions and saute until golden, about 10 minutes. In a small saucepan, combine the anchovies and 1 cup half-and-half, and cook together over medium heat until the mixture bubbles around the edges of the pan.Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish and layer the potatoes and onions in it, grinding a bit of black pepper over each layer. Pour the warm cream mixture over all, distributing the anchovy bits equally among the potatoes. Add more half-and-half, if necessary so the cream barely covers the potatoes. Bake uncovered for 1 _ hours, or until the potatoes are tender and golden brown. ",,Heartland,No,No,yes
Coq au vin,Supper,Kentucky,fall,No,,"From: Time-Life: Poultry, 1978 (originally: The French Menu Cookbook, Richard Olney)6 lb chicken, preferably a cock 10 to 12 months old, cut into serving piecessalt and pepper2 strips lean salt pork with the rind removed, sliced 2/3 inch thick and cut into cubes2 to 3 tbsp oil or butter3 medium-sized carrots cut into sections 1 to 2 inches long3 medium-sized onions, coarsely chopped2 tbsp. flour_ cup brandy3 cups dry red wine1 bouquet garni made up of a pinch of thyme, a bay leaf and a few sprigs parsley_ lb mushrooms10 to 11 tbsp butter25 or 30 small boiling onions, peeled6 slices firm-textured white bread with the crusts removed, halved diagonally1 garlic clovechopped fresh parsleyParboil the pieces of salt pork for 2 minutes, drain, and dry them in a towel. Put them to fry over low heat in a large, heavy sauteuse or skillet with a bit of oil or butter. When the pieces are golden brown, remove them and put them aside. In the same cooking fat, place the carrots and chopped onions. Keep the heat between medium and low, and allow them to cook, stirring regularly to avoid overbrowning, for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the vegetables, put them aside and replace them with the chicken pieces, previously salted. Cook the chicken over a somewhat higher heat until gently browned on all sides, spring with flour and continue to cook, turning the pieces as necessary. Return the saut_ed onions and carrots ot the pan. When the flour has cooked for a few minutes, pour in the brandy, carefully set it alight and stir. When the flames have died, add the wine and raise the heat. Stir the chicken pieces and move them around until the liquid comes to a boil.At this point, if the skillet is already overfull of the hciken, or if perhaps you have had to use two skillets and both seem too full to permit adding the vegetables, keep the carrots and onions aside and add them later when the chickens goes into the oven dish.Transfer the chicken pieces and vegetables to an earthenware, copper or enameled cast-iron casserole with a lid. Stir and scarpe the first pan with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve the fryin adherents, then pour the liquid over the chicken pieces. If they are not completely covered, add enough wine, water or good stock (water is better than indifferent stock) to barely, but entirely, cover them. Add the bouquet garni (or simply sprinkle with thyme, and add the bay leaf and parsley sprigs untied). Put to cook, covered, in the oven, regulating the heat so that the sauce hardly simmers. The length of cooking time depends on the birdês age and _pastÓ _ from 30 to 45 minutes for a fryer that has never exercised to 1 _ hours for a 10-month-old rooster, and an hour loner still for one that may be too old to have a fine flesh but will produce a marvelous sauce.Meanwhile cook the boiling onions, seasoned, in butter over very low heat, shaking the pan from time to time, for 20 to 30 minutes. Kepp them covered and avoid browning them; if the sauce pan is not heavy enough, you may have to use a fireproof pad over the heat source. Remove the oninos when they are done and use the same pany to fry the mushrooms. Trim the mushroom stems and cut the caps into two or four pieces (if they are small, leave them whole). Toss them in butter over high heat for 2 or 3 minutes; season with salt and freshly ground pepper.Transfer the hciken pieces and the carrots to a platter. Pass the cooking liquid through a fine sieve into a saucepan, using a pestle to work the residue. Discard the remains of the bouquet garni. In the saucepan, skim as much fat from the surface of the liquid as pssible and bring it to a boil, then position the saucepan over the heat so as to permit its contents to simmer only on one side. Carefully skim off all fat and impurities as they surface over the next 30 minutes or so. If, at this point, the sauce is still too thin, turn up the heat to create a fast boil, stirring constantly until you achieve the right consistency.Put the hciken pieces and the carrots back in the oven dish, distribute the garnish (saut_ed mushrooms, glazed boilin onions, and fired pork sections) on top and pour over the sauce. Cover and return to the oven to simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes.Brown the triangles of bread in butter over low heat until golden and cirsp. (They may be prepared ahead of time and rewarmed in the oven.)To serve, place the chicken pieces more or less symmetrically on a large, warmed platter. Rub the crouton tirangles with the clove of garlic, dip a corner of each triangle in the sauce, then in the chopped parsley, and arrange them around the edge of the platter, parslied tips pointing out. Pour sauce and garnish over the chicken and sprinkle with a bit of chopped parsley. Serve with steamed potatoes. ",,Time-Life,No,No,No

Wash pork in hot water. Place it on top of beans. Cover beanpot. Beans are now ready to go into oven. A low temperature is needed, around 250F for 8 hours of baking; although they should not be stirred, they do need attention ocassionally, for they need to be kept covered with boiling water at all times. The beanpot itself needs to be kept covered until the last hour of baking; then, remove cover so the beans will brown on top.Are you longin for baked beans, yet salt pork is eliminated from your diet? Then do exactly as given above, only in place of _ pound of salt pork, use 4 tablespoons cookin oil per pound dry beans, or 2 tablespoons cooking oil per cup of dry beans.

Vegan Michigan Cassoulet with Sweet Potatoes and Tempeh,Supper,Kentucky,winter,No,,"Adapted from: Heartland: The Best of the Old and the New from Midwest Kitchens, Marcia Adams, 1991, p. 110.1 lb dried Michigan navy beans1 celery stalk2 bay leavesHandful of parsley sprigs_ cup chopped celery_ cup chopped onion_ cup chopped carrot1 cup chopped sweet potatoes_ - 1 lb tempeh, cut into squares1 tsp minced garlicOlive oil1 14-oz can tomatoes, drained_ cup dry white wine2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley_ tsp dried thyme_ tsp dried savory_ tsp freshly ground black pepper2 thick slices French bread2 tsp finely minced fresh parsleyEven the plainest of Midwestern cooks hs been making a stripped-down version of cassoulet for years _ what she calls ham and beans. And generally it is a rather good dish.The beloved French provincial casserole of white beans and assorted meats and either duck or goose requires several daysê labor and umpteen mixing boards; this simplified version uses a slow cooker and rquires no watching. Start the beans by soaking them the night before cooking, and be sure to save the bean cooking liquid.Place the beans in a large kettle with water to cover; soak overnight. The next morning, add the celery stalk, 1 bay leaf, and parsley to the beans, cover and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes. Drain, reserving 2 cups of the cooking liquid. Discard the celery and herbs and transfer the beans to the slow-cooker. Cook the chopped celery, onion, carrot, and arlic in the live oil over medium heat until the onion begins to brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to the cooker. Then add some more olive oil and start the sweet potatoes. When they start to soften, add the tempeh and tomatoes, wine, parsley and seasonsings. Add to the bean mixture in the cooker. Mix gently to avoid breaking up the beans. Add enough of the reserved cooking liquid to come within 1 inch of the top of the beans.Cover, turn temperature to high, and cook for 1 hour. Turn to low and continue cooking for 3 to 4 hours; do not stir while cooking. The cooking time is imprecise, for this depends on the age of the beans, their growing locale, and even the hardness of the water. Do not let beans overcook and get mushy. If necessary, add more of the reserved cooking water to keep the water level at 1 inch below the top of the beans.Meanwhile, toast the bread in a flat plan in a 160F oven for 2 hours. Break into large pieces and process until fine crumbs are formed _ you need a scant _ cup. Stir in the parsley. About 30 minutes before the beans are done, sprinkle the crumbs on top and then, using a wooden spoon, gently push them deep down into the beans to thicken the juices. When the beans have reached the desired texture, turn off the cooker. Serve hot.",,Heartland,Yes,Yes,No
