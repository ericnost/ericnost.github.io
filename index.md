###About
#Me 
I am a geographer researching how data and technology may inform conservation. My most recent project followed the US state of Louisiana's efforts to simulate future land loss along the Gulf Coast. Based on interviews, document surveys, and attendance at public meetings, I explain how bureaucrats and ecosystem scientists build an infrastructure for modeling, learn from their simulations, and apply their findings to planning large-scale wetland restoration. The project characterizes the winners and losers that result and speaks to the opportunities and limits of other applications of "big data" in (environmental) governance. Some of my previous research examined the contested role of software in ecosystem services markets in Oregon, while new projects explore digital agriculture, especially the design, management, and use of decision-support tools and data infrastructure.

I teach classes in nature-society geography and (web) mapping. I make maps to publicize hidden dimensions of environmental policy and also participate in the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, tracking how the US federal government portrays climate and other issues on the web. For the past several years, I have collaborated in an effort to visualize US EPA data on the North American hazardous waste trade.

#Scholarly interests and publications:
* Digital infrastructures and governance
For application in governance, data itself needs to be both governed (who collects, who manages, who contributes, who has access, who pays) and infrastructured (social standards and material affordances) into policy regimes. What are the platforms (EIS, modeling, websites, databases, DBMS, etc.) enabling environmental governance? What are the politics around these platforms themselves? What consequences? Who wins/loses?

* Digital practice and praxis
who are the users of digital tools - models, maps, social media? what can actors learn and do with the tools/what are they afforded? can we make tools differently? how can data serve progressive ends (in and beyond the classroom)? Data in the public interest.
