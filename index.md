title: Welcome!

I research how data technologies inform environmental governance, drawing on and contributing to the fields of political ecology, science and technology studies (STS), and digital geographies. 

New kinds of data-generating sensors and data-synthesizing algorithms are becoming central to everyday life and may prove transformational at a policy-level as well. A key challenge for geographers in the coming years is assessing these technologies' promise to help society solve sustainability issues related to food security, climate change adaptation, and ecosystem services. This will be done by understanding their human dimensions - their design, use, maintenance, and social impacts - alongside other governance trends such as marketization and metrification. 

My [dissertation](https://search.proquest.com/docview/2043521221) followed the US state of Louisiana’s efforts to simulate future wetlands loss along the Gulf Coast. I explained how bureaucrats and ecosystem scientists develop their data infrastructures, build institutions for learning from their simulations, and apply their findings to planning large-scale coastal restoration. The project characterized the winners and losers that result and speaks to the opportunities and limits of “big data” in conservation. Some of my previous research examined the contested role of modeling software in ecosystem services markets in Oregon, while new projects explore digital agriculture - especially the design and use of farm decision-support tools.

I teach undergraduate courses in nature-society geography and (web)mapping. A core component of my work involves making maps to publicize the hidden dimensions of environmental policy. I participate in the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](https://www.envirodatagov.org), where we [bring people together to analyze data](https://www.environmentalenforcementwatch.org/) in the US EPA's Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database and track how the US federal government portrays climate change on the web. I have also collaborated in efforts to visualize EPA data on the North American hazardous waste trade. View our work [here](https://www.geography.wisc.edu/hazardouswaste).

### Recruitment
I’m excited to hear from prospective grad students who are curious about the intersections of digital technologies and environmental governance. Some specific projects we could collaborate on might include:

* evaluating ecosystem services decision-support software and conservationist groups' use of it
* understanding the use of decision-support tools and/or the design of data governance frameworks within "smart" farming
* visualizing environmental agencies’ and nonprofits' web presences and practices

Prospective students might be interested in conducting interviews, document analysis, and surveys for their research, as well as working critically with digital technologies themselves. I can offer training in critical communication skills - including via mapping, web design, and public writing - and in the scholarly fields of political ecology, science and technology studies, and digital geographies.


### Data governance and infrastructure
Environmental governance actors - states, corporations, conservation groups, farmers, and so on - struggle to get the information they want. There's more and more data out there every day, but it's often siloed, and even when it's available, it's not necessarily relevant and there usually isn't the time or money to make sense of it. Governing nature, it turns out, means governing data. Who collects and manages environmental data, who contributes to databases and has access, and who pays for it all? These questions tend to crystallize in data infrastructures.

### Digital practice and praxis
Decision-makers increasingly aim for what they call "data-driven"  governance. But data doesn't "drive" as much as it affords, and it has to be learned from, through institutions for accessing expertise, communicating expectations, and legitimating "good modelers". Who are the users of digital technologies? What can they learn and do with their tools? How can data serve public ends, in and beyond the classroom?
