title: Welcome!

I research how data technologies inform environmental governance. New kinds of data-generating sensors and data-synthesizing algorithms are becoming central to everyday life and may prove transformational in policy too. A key challenge for geographers in the coming years is assessing these technologies’ promise to help society solve sustainability issues related to toxic pollution, food security, climate change adaptation, and ecosystem services conservation. This will be done by understanding their human dimensions - their design, use, maintenance, and effects on society - alongside other governance trends such as marketization and metrification. It will involve understanding how these data systems came to be but also experimenting with them towards more just and equitable ends.

My work contributes to the field of political ecology and is supported by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council, SSHRC. I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in nature-society geography and methods, including in Guelph's Master's of Conservation Leadership program. I am a member of the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](https://www.envirodatagov.org) (EDGI), where we [bring people together to analyze publicly available socio-environmental data](https://www.environmentalenforcementwatch.org/) and track the portrayal of climate change issues on the web. 

## Projects
* [Digital Conservation](https://ericnost.github.io/digitalconservation) - Big data and related data collection tools such as acoustic
sensors; machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms; dashboards and platforms for sharing data – these all constitute “digital conservation.” Digital technologies have the potential to make conservation more holistic, responsive, and participatory. However, we hear a lot about the promises of digital conservation and less about the challenges. Is access to digital conservation democratic? Are outcomes lining up with expectations? In general, what do conservationists actually think about and do with digital tools?
  * Urban Political Ecology of Informal Greenspaces - There is a growing movement to create national parks in urban Canada, propelled in part by COVID restrictions in which more people
turned to parks as sources of relaxation and connection. At the same time, it is increasingly recognized that “informal greenspaces” (IGS) from pop-up parks to vacant lots may also provide significant ecosystem service and biodiversity benefits as well as meaningful recreational opportunities. This research project asks, how can we identify these IGS, understand what they mean to people, and assess their relationship with conventional parks? We will: 1) identify and characterize IGS using volunteered geographic information (VGI) from citizen science platforms; 2) compare informal and formal greenspaces in terms of their accessibility and biophysical qualities; 3) contextualize the limitations of the VGI data we utilize. We will test our approach in southern Ontario.
* [Environmental Data Justice](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2018.1511410)
  * Situating Data for Environmental Justice – Canada’s National Strategy to Address Environmental Racism requires the federal government to complete a study examining whether racialized, Indigenous, and other marginalized communities are disproportionately exposed to hazards such as toxic pollutants. The study is likely to rely on existing datasets, mapping, and analytical approaches. As such, it may focus only on proving the existence of environmental racism rather than illustrating its mechanisms. Our project will instead demonstrate mechanisms such as the failure of policy to address cumulative effects, showing which communities have dealt with the most toxic substances, the longest, and which are home to industrial facilities habitually non-compliant with environmental health protection laws.  
  * Environmental Enforcement Watch (EEW)](https://www.environmentalenforcementwatch.org/) - EEW is a collaborative project engaging with the Environmental Protection Agency’s Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database and to: draw large-scale public attention to the lack of environmental enforcement; work with partner organizations, especially marginalized communities, to build data efficacy through mutually beneficial relationships; inform EPA visions of alternative forms of public engagement; prototype community-oriented structures for environmental data, i.e. by congressional district, watershed, and health risks for a community; call attention to the relationship between environmental enforcement, environmental racism, and other interlocking forms of oppression (particularly white supremacy, capitalism, settler-colonialism, heteropatriarchy, etc.)

## Recruitment
I am actively recruiting Master's and/or PhD students to work on the above [projects](#projects). Prospective students should be interested in conducting interviews, document analysis, survey, and/or statistical and spatial analysis for their research. I can offer training in communication skills - including mapping, data visualization, and public writing - and in the scholarly fields of political ecology and science and technology studies. Students would have the opportunity to collaborate with the [Environmental and Data Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org/) and other partners. Former graduate students have gone on to work in academia and in the conservation and environmental NGO sectors. 

I welcome interested candidates to email me with a brief statement of interest, an unofficial transcript, and a writing/research sample.

I especially encourage applications by individuals from justice-seeking groups and those underrepresented in higher education. The Department of Geography, Environment and Geomatics at Guelph and I aim to foster welcoming and collaborative spaces that value diversity and wellness. More about the Department:
* Guaranteed funding for all graduate students for the duration of the program
* Comprehensive support for fieldwork and research expenses
* Outstanding faculty dedicated to a collaborative model of graduate education
* Research-intensive, collegial department in one of Canada’s top comprehensive universities
* Spacious campus with modern amenities in a vibrant community

## Selected Papers
### Data governance and infrastructure
Environmental governance actors - states, corporations, conservation groups, farmers, and so on - struggle to get the information they want. There's more and more data out there every day, but it's often siloed. Even when it's available, it's not necessarily relevant and there typically isn't the time or money to make sense of it. Governing nature, it turns out, means governing data. Who collects environmental data and manages environmental databases, and who pays for it all? These questions tend to crystallize in data infrastructures.

### Digital practice and praxis
Decision-makers increasingly aim for what they call "data-driven" governance. But data doesn't "drive" as much as it affords. It has to be learned from, through institutions that allow decision-makers to access expertise and communicate their expectations. Who are the users of digital technologies? What can they learn and do with their tools? How can data serve public ends, in and beyond the classroom?
