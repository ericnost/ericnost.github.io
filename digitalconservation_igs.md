title: Digital Conservation - Watershed Prioritization Using New Data Sources Lab

---
We are not trying to train you to be Geographic Information System (GIS) technicians. You will learn how to employ GIS and modeling, social media/volunteered geographic information, and data dashboards in specific use cases – modeling landscapes, assessing recreational and other ecosystem services, and interactively prioritizing conservation investments. 

The lab is divided into three parts:
1.	Modeling Landscape Values
2.	Social Media and Volunteered Geographic Information
3.	Dashboards for Prioritizing Conservation Investments

By the end, you'll have created a data dashboard, the kind of which we see many conservation organizations deploying for public outreach and decision-making purposes right now. Specifically, you’ll have built a dashboard that would help decision-makers prioritize conservation investments in a southern Ontario watershed.

The overarching prompt that will guide your work: where should we invest in new conservation areas? Imagine you are tasking a GIS tech with building a publicly-available tool that would allow you, your organization, and your partners to investigate watershed conditions and possible areas for investment. It would be helpful to know, in some detail, what to task the tech with building. Through this you will learn about the kinds of conservation tools, tech, and data available to organizations and some of the practical and ethical concerns arising in them.

### Requirements
To complete this lab, you will need the following:
* Access to QGIS free, open access mapping software
* Access to ArcGIS Pro software
* Access to one of the lab datasets - available here [(Niagara Region)]() and here [(Toronto Region)]
