Miami Beach is a perfect location for the site, as the South Florida area is home to a number of Holocaust survivors. Before its construction, objections were raised by some who believed that Miami Beach was a symbol of fun and a holocaust memorial would put a damper on that image. However, after the group of survivors pleaded their case, the memorial was finally approved. the Holocaust Memorial is a solemn reminder of crimes against humanity, as the Sculpture of Love and Anguish (the focal point of the site) can be a heart-wrenching reminder of the past. the thousands of victims' names etched into the luminous black granite Memorial Wall is one of the most emotional reads visitors are ever likely to experience.
