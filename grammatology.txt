The translation is a noble job, and we should be grateful to have this dis

tinguished book in

 

our hands ... [Spivak’s] situating of Derrida among his precursors—Nietzsche, Freud,

 

Heidegger, Husserl—and contemporaries—Lacan, Foucault, and the elusive animal known as

 

structuralism—is very lucid and extremely useful.”—Michael Wood, 

New York Review of

 

Books

“

One of the major works in the development of contemporary criticism and

 

philosophy.” J. Hillis Miller, Yale University

Jacques Derrida’s revolutionary theories about deconstruction, phenom

enology,

 

psychoanalysis, and structuralism, first voiced in the 1960s, forever changed the face of

 

European and American criticism. The ideas in 

De la grammatologie 

sparked lively debates in

 

intellectual circles that included students of literature, philosophy, and the humanities,

 

inspiring these stu-dents to ask questions of their disciplines that had previously been consid

-

ered improper. Thirty years later, the immense influence of Derrida’s work is still igniting

 

controversy, thanks in part to Gayatri Spivak’s translation, which captures the richness and

 

complexity of the original. This corrected edition adds a new index of the critics and

 




philosophers cited in the text and makes one of contemporary criticism’s most indispensable

 

works even more accessible and usable.

Acknowledgments

I thank Angelo Bertocci for having given me the idea for this transla

tion. I thank Paul de Man

 

for his patient and penetrating criticism of the Translator’s Preface and the text, at a time

 

when his own schedule was so thoroughly besieged. I thank J. Hillis Miller for his advice, his

 

active en

couragement, and his acute comments on the Translator’s Preface. I owe him

 

particular thanks for having introduced me to Derrida himself after I had been working on this

 

book for a year. I am grateful to John Brenkmen, Leone Stein, and Paul M. Wright for their

 

support during the early stages of the work. In the preparation of the translation, I have been

 

particularly helped by four painstaking and indefatigable bilingual readers: Jessie L. Hornsby,

 

Dori Katz, Richard Laden, Talbot Spivak. Pierre de Saint-Victor, the late Alexander Aspel,

 

Jacques Bourgeacq and Donald Jackson untied occasional knots. To all of them, a

 

considerable debt of gratitude is due. (The whole book is a gift for Talbot Spivak.) I thank

 

also the Carver Foundation at the University of Iowa for making it possible for me to go to

 

France in the summer of 1973 to discuss this book with Jacques Derrida. To Robert Scholes I

 

am grateful for having made it possible for me to teach a seminar on Derrida at Brown

 

University in the fall of 1974-75. At that seminar, especially through active exchange with

 

Bella Brodzky and Tom Claire, I staked out the ground for my Preface.

I am grateful to Peter Bacon for typing the first half of the manuscript and the Preface from

 

sometimes indecipherable copy. Pauline Crimson not only typed the rest, but always delivered

 

material at very short notice with-out complaint, and conscientiously copy-edited my pages. I

 

believe she came to feel a personal responsibility for the making of this book, and for that I

 

am most grateful. I thank Timothy Shipe for his able assistance.




Without Dominick Franco, my research assistant, the manuscript would not have gone to

 

press. Michael Ryan criticized each version of the Trans

lator’s Preface with a sharp and

 

inspired eye and helped untiringly with library materials. I cannot thank him enough for his

 

incredibly meticulous and informed reading of the final proofs. And Catty, indifferent yet

 

devoted companion through a season of solitary labor.

I am grateful to 

Grammatology 

for having brought me the friendship of Marguerite and

 

Jacques Derrida.

Translator’s Preface

If you have been reading Derrida, you will know that a plausible gesture would be to begin

 

with a consideration of “the question of the preface.” But I write in the hope that for at least

 

some of the readers of this volume Derrida is new; and therefore take it for granted that, for

 

the moment, an introduction can be made.

Jacques Derrida is maître-assistant in philosophy at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris.

 

He was born forty-five years ago of Sephardic Jewish parents in Algiers.1 At nineteen, he

 

came to France as a student. He was at Harvard on a scholarship in 1956-57. In the sixties he

 

was among the young intellectuals writing for the avant-garde journal 

Tel Quel. 2 

He is now

 

associated with GREPH (Groupe de Recherche de l’Enseignement Philosophique)—a student

 

movement that engages itself with the problems of the institutional teaching of philosophy. He

 

was for a time a visit-ing professor on a regular basis at the johns Hopkins University, and

 

now occupies a similar position at Yale. He has an affection for some of the intellectual

 

centers of the Eastern seaboard—Cambridge, New York, Balti

more—in his vocabulary,

 

“America.” And it seems that at first these places and now more and more of the intellectual

 

centers all over the United States are returning his affection.

Derrida’s first book was a translation of Edmund Husserl’s “Origin of Geometry,” with a long

 

critical introduction. This was followed by La voix 

et le phénomène, 

a critique of Husserl’s

 

theory of meaning. In between appeared a collection of essays entitled 

L’écriture et la

 

différence. De la grammatologie 

came next, followed by two more collections—La

 

dissémina

tion 

and 

Marges de la philosophie. 

There was a little noticed introduction to the

 

Essai sur l’origine des connaissances humaines 

by Condillac, en-titled “L’archéologie du

 

frivole,” and 

Positions, 

a collection of interviews. This year his monumental 

Glas 

has

 

appeared. 3

Jacques Derrida is also this collection of texts.




In an essay on the “Preface” to Hegel’s 

Phenomenology of the Mind, 

Jean Hyppolite writes:

((x))

When Hegel had finished the 

Phenomenology . . . 

he reflected retrospectively on his

 

philosophic enterprise and wrote the “Preface.” ... It is a strange demon

stration, for he says

 

above all, “Don’t take me seriously in a preface. The real philosophical work is what I have

 

just written, the 

Phenomenology of the Mind. 

And if I speak to you outside of what I have

 

written, these marginal comments cannot have the value of the work itself. . . . Don’t take a

 

preface seriously. The preface announces a project and a project is nothing until it is

 

realized.”4

It is clear that, as it is commonly understood, the preface harbors a lie. “Prae-fatio” is “a

 

saying before-hand” (Oxford English Dictionary—OED). Yet it is accepted as natural by

 

Hyppolite, as indeed by all of us, that “Hegel reflected 

retrospectively 

on his philosophic

 

enterprise and wrote his ‘Preface’.” We may see this as no more than the tacit acceptance of a

 

fiction. We think of the Preface, however, not as a literary, but as an expository exercise. It

 

“involves a norm of truth,” although it might well be the insertion of an obvious fiction into

 

an ostensibly “true” discourse. (Of course, when the preface is being written by someone

 

other than the author, the situation is yet further complicated. A pretense at writing 

before a

 

text that one must have read 

before 

the preface can be written. Writing a postface would not

 

really be different—but that argument can only be grasped at the end of this preface.)

Hegel’s own objection to the Preface seems grave. The contrast be

tween abstract generality

 

and the self-moving 

activity 

of cognition appears to be structured like the contrast between

 

preface and text. The method of philosophy is the structure of knowing, an activity of

 

consciousness that moves of itself; this activity, the method of philosophical discourse, struc

-

tures the philosophical text. The reader of the philosophical text will recog

nize this self-

movement in his consciousness as he surrenders himself to and masters the text. Any

 

prefatory gesture, abstracting so-called themes, robs philosophy of its self-moving structure.

 

“In modern times,” Hegel writes, “an individual finds the abstract form ready made.”5

 

Further,

let [modern man] read reviews of philosophical works, and even go to the length of reading

 

the prefaces and first paragraphs of the works themselves; for the latter give the general

 

principles on which everything turns, while the reviews along with the historical notice

 

provide over and above the critical judgment and appreciation, which, being a judgment

 

passed on the work, goes farther than the work that is judged. This common way a man can

 

take in his dressing-gown. But spiritual elation in the eternal, the sacred, the infinite, moves

 

along the high way of truth in the robes of the high priest 

.6

Yet, as Hyppolite points out, Hegel damns the preface in general even as he writes his own

 

“Preface.” And Derrida suggests that a very significant part of Hegel’s work was but a play of

 

prefaces (Dis 15f). Whereas Hegel’s




((xi))

impatience with prefaces is based on philosophical grounds, his excuse for continuing to write

 

them seems commonsensical: “Having in mind that the general idea of what is to be done, if it

 

precedes the attempt to carry it out, facilitates the comprehension of this process, it is worth

 

while to indicate here some rough idea of it, with the intention of eliminating at the same time

 

certain forms whose habitual presence is a hindrance to philosophical knowledge 

[in der

 

Absicht zugleich, bei dieser Gelegenheit einige Formen zu entfernen, deren Gewohnheit ein

 

Hindernis für das philosophische Erkennen ist].” 7 

Hegel’s objection to prefaces reflects the

 

following struc

ture: preface/text — abstract generality/self-moving activity. His accept

ance of

 

prefaces reflects another structure: preface/text = signifier/sig

nified. And the name of the “—“

 

in this formula is the Hegelian 

Auf

hebung.

Au f hebung is 

a relationship between two terms where the second at once annuls the first and

 

lifts it up into a higher sphere of existence; it is a hierarchial concept generally translated

 

“sublation” and now sometimes translated “sublimation.” A successful preface is 

aufgehoben

 

into the text it precedes, just as a word is 

aufgehoben 

into its meaning. It is as if, to use one of

 

Derrida’s structural metaphors, the son or seed (preface or word), caused or engendered by the

 

father (text or meaning) is recovered by the father and thus justified.

But, within this structural metaphor, Derrida’s cry is “dissemination,” the seed that neither

 

inseminates nor is recovered by the father, but is scattered abroad. 8 And he makes room for

 

the prefatory gesture in quite another way:

The preface is a necessary gesture of homage and parricide, for the book (the father) makes a

 

claim of authority or origin which is both true and false. (As regards parricide, I speak

 

theoretically. The preface need make no overt claim—as this one does not—of destroying its

 

pre-text. As a preface, it is already surrendered to that gesture. . . .) Humankind’s common

 

desire is for a stable center, and for the assurance of mastery—through knowing or

 

possessing. And a book, with its ponderable shape and its beginning, middle, and end, stands

 

to satisfy that desire. But what sovereign subject is the origin of the book? “I was not one man

 

only,” says Proust’s narrator, “but the steady advance hour after hour of an army in close

 

formation, in which there appeared, according to the moment, impassioned men, indif

ferent

 

men, jealous men. . . . In a composite mass, these elements may, one by one, 

without our

 

noticing it, 

be replaced by others, which others again eliminate or reinforce, until in the end a

 

change has been brought about which it would be impossible to conceive if we were a single

 

person.” 9 What, then, is the book’s identity? Ferdinand de Saussure had remarked that the

 

“same” phoneme pronounced twice or by two different people is

((xii))

not identical with itself. Its only identity is in its difference from all other phonemes (77-78,

 

52-54

*). So do the two readings of the “same” book show an identity that can only be defined

 

as a difference. The book is not repeatable in its “identity”: each reading of the book produces

 

a simu

lacrum of an “original” that is itself the mark of the shifting and unstable subject that

 

Proust describes, using and being used by a language that is also shifting and unstable. Any

 




preface commemorates that difference in identity by inserting itself between two readings—in

 

our case, my reading (given of course that my language and I are shifting and unstable), my

 

rereading, my rearranging of the text—and your reading. As Hegel (and other defenders of the

 

authority of the text) wrote preface on preface to match re-editions and revised versions, they

 

unwittingly became a party to this identity in difference:

From the moment that the circle turns, that the book is wound back upon itself, that the book

 

repeats itself, its self-identity receives an imperceptible difference which allows us to step

 

effectively, rigorously, and thus discreetly, out of the closure. Redoubling the closure, one

 

splits it. Then one escapes it furtively, be

tween two passages through the same book, through

 

the same line, following the same bend. . . . This departure outside of the identical within the

 

same remains very slight, it weighs nothing, it thinks and weighs the book 

as such. 

The return

 

to the book is also the abandoning of the book. 

(ED 430)

The preface, by daring to repeat the book and reconstitute it in another register, merely enacts

 

what is already the case: the book’s repetitions are always other than the book. There is, in

 

fact, no “book” other than these ever-different repetitions: the “book” in other words, is

 

always already a “text,” constituted by the play of identity and difference. A written preface

 

provisionally localizes the place where, between reading and reading, book and book, the

 

inter-inscribing of “reader(s),” “writer(s),” and language is forever at work. Hegel had closed

 

the circle between father and son, text and preface. He had in fact suggested, as Derrida

 

makes clear, that the fulfilled concept—the end of the self-acting method of the philosophical

 

text—was the pre-dicate—pre-saying—pre-face, to the preface. In Derrida’s reworking, the

 

structure preface-text becomes open at both ends. The text has no stable identity, no stable

 

origin, no stable end. Each act of reading the “text” is a preface to the next. The reading of a

 

self-professed preface is no exception to this rule.

It is inaccurate yet necessary to say that something called 

De la gram

matologie 

is (was) the

 

provisional origin of my preface. And, even as I write, I project the moment, when you,

 

reading, will find in my preface the provisional origin of your reading of 

Of Grammatology.

 

There can be an indefinite number of variations on that theme.

((xiii))

Why must we worry over so simple a thing as preface-making? There is, of course, no real

 

answer to questions of this sort. The most that can be said, and Derrida has reminded us to say

 

it anew, is that a certain view of the world, of consciousness, and of language has been

 

accepted as the correct one, and, if the minute particulars of that view are examined, a rather

 

different picture (that is also a no-picture, as we shall see) emerges. That examination

 

involves an enquiry into the 

“operation” of our most familiar gestures. To quote Hegel again:




What is “familiarly known” is not properly known, just for the reason that it is “familiar.”

 

When engaged in the process of knowing, it is the commonest form of self-deception, and a

 

deception of other people as well, to assume something to be familiar, and to let it pass

 

[gefallen zu lassen] 

on that very account. Knowl

edge of that sort, with all its talking around it

 

[Hin- and Herreden] 

never gets from the spot, but has no idea that this is the case. . . . To

 

display 

[auseinander-legen] 

an idea in its original 

[ursprünglich] 

elements means returning

 

upon its moments, . . 10

When Derrida writes that, since Kant, philosophy has become aware of taking the

 

responsibility for its discourse, it is this reexamination of the familiar that he is hinting at. And

 

this is one of the reasons why he is so drawn to Mallarmé, “that exemplary poet,” who

 

invested every gesture of reading and writing—even the slitting of an uncut double page with

 

a knife —with textual import. 11

And if the assumption of responsibility for one’s discourse leads to the conclusion that all

 

conclusions are genuinely provisional and therefore in-conclusive, that all origins are

 

similarly unoriginal, that responsibility itself must cohabit with frivolity, this need not be

 

cause for gloom. Derrida con

trasts Rousseau’s melancholy with Nietzsche’s affirmative joy

 

precisely from this angle: “Turned toward the presence, lost or impossible, of the absent

 

origin, [the] structuralist thematic of broken immediateness is thus the sad, 

negative,

 

nostalgic, guilty, Rousseauist aspect of the thought of play of which the Nietzschean

 

affirmation—the 

joyous affirmation of the play of the world and of the innocence of

 

becoming, the affirmation of a world of signs without fault, without truth, without origin,

 

offered to an active interpretation—would be the other side.” (ED 427, SC 264)

There is, then, always already a preface between two hands holding open a book. And the

 

“prefacer,” of the same or another proper name as the “author,” need not apologize for

 

“repeating” the text.

I

“

It is inaccurate yet necessary to say,” I have written above, “that some-thing called 

De la

 

grammatologie 

is (was) the provisional origin of my

((xiv))

preface.” Inaccurate yet necessary. My predicament is an analogue for a certain philosophical

 

exigency that drives Derrida to writing “sous rature,” which I translate as “under erasure.”

 

This is to write a word, cross it out, and then print both word and deletion. (Since the word is

 

inaccurate, it is crossed out. Since it is necessary, it remains legible.) To take an example from

 

Derrida that I shall cite again: “. . . the sign [is med kryss] that ill-named [thing med kryss] ...

 

which escapes the instituting question of philosophy . . .” (31, 19) .

In examining familiar things we come to such unfamiliar conclusions that our very language

 

is twisted and bent even as it guides us. Writing “under erasure” is the mark of this contortion.




Derrida directs us to Martin Heidegger’s 

Zur Seins f rage 

as the “au

thority” for this

 

strategically important practice, 12 which we cannot under-stand without a look at

 

Heidegger’s formulation of it.

Zur Seinsfrage 

is ostensibly a letter to Ernst Jünger which seeks to estab

lish a speculative

 

definition of nihilism. Just as Hegel, writing a preface, philosophically confronted the

 

problem of prefaces, so Heidegger, establish-ing a definition, philosophically confronts the

 

problem of definitions: in order for the nature of anything in particular to be defined as an

 

entity, the question of Being is general must always already be broached and answered in the

 

affirmative. That something is, presupposes that 

anything 

can be.

What is this question of Being that is necessarily precomprehended in order that thinking

 

itself occur? Since it is always anterior to thinking, it can never be formulated as an answer to

 

the question “what is . . .:” “The ‘goodness’ of the rightfully demanded ‘good definition’ finds

 

its confirma

tion in our giving up the wish to define in so far as this must be established on

 

assertions in which thinking dies out. . . . No information can be given about nothingness and

 

Being and nihilism, about their essence and about the (verbal) essence [it is] of the (nominal)

 

essence 

[it 

is] which can be presented tangibly in the form of assertions [it is . . .].” 

(QB 

8o–

81) This possibility of Being must be granted (or rather is already of itself granted) for the

 

human being to say “I am,” not to mention “von are,” “she is.” Even such negative concepts

 

as “nothingness” or “nihilism” are held within this precomprehended question of Being which

 

is asked and answered non-verbally, nonnominally, and without agency. This question,

 

therefore, cannot be constructed to match an assertive answer. And the human being is the

 

place or zone where this particular problem has its play; not the human being as an individual,

 

but the human being as Dasein—simply being-there—as the principle that asks and posits:

 

‘Man does not only stand 

in 

the critical zone. . . . He himself, but not he for himself and

 

particularly not through himself alone, is this zone. . . .” 

(QB 82–83) 

But, Heidegger cautions

 

us, this is not mysticism. It is the baffling result of an examination of the obvious, the lifting

 

of the most natural forgetfulness.

“

What if even the [propositional] language of metaphysics and meta-

((xv))

physics itself, whether it be that of the living or of the dead God, as metaphysics, formed that

 

barrier which forbids a crossing over 

[Ubergehen] 

the line [from the assertion, to the

 

question, of Being]?” (Elsewhere Heidegger suggests, as does, of course, Nietzsche before

 

him, that the propo

sitional language of the sciences is just as forgetful of the question of

 

Being.) “If that were the case, would not then the crossing [out] [diagonally—

Überqueren] 

of

 

the line necessarily become a transformation of language and demand a transformed

 

relationship to the essence of language?” 

(QB 7

0—

7

1)

As a move toward this transformation, Heidegger crosses out the word “Being,” and lets both

 

deletion and word stand. It is inaccurate to use the word “Being” here, for the differentiation

 

of a “concept” of Being has already slipped away from that precomprehended question of

 

Being. Yet it is necessary to use the word, since language cannot do more:




A thoughtful glance ahead into this realm of “Being” can only write it as [Being med kryss]

 

The drawing of these crossed lines at first only wards off 

[abwehrt], 

especially the habit of

 

conceiving “Being” as something standing by itself. . . . The sign of crossing through

 

[Zeichen der Durchkreuzung] 

can, to be sure, . . . not be a merely negative sign of crossing

 

out 

[Zeichen der Durchstreichung] . . . . 

Man in his essence is the memory [or “memorial,”

 

Gedächtnis] 

of Being, but of [Being med kryss], This means that the essence of man is a pale

 

of that which in the crossed intersected lines of [Being med kryss] puts thinking under the

 

claim of a more originary command 

[anfänglichere Geheiss]. (QB 

8o–81, 

82–83)

Language is indeed straining here. The sentence “Man in his essence is the memory

 

(memorial) of Being” avoids ascribing an agent to the unask

able question of Being.

 

Heidegger is working with the resources of the old language, the language we already

 

possess, and which possesses us. To make a new word is to run the risk of forgetting the

 

problem or believing it solved: “That the transformation of the language which contemplates

 

the essence of Being is subject to other demands than the exchanging of an old terminology

 

for a new one, seems to be clear.” This transformation should rather involve “crossing out”

 

the relevant old terms and thus liberating them, exposing “the presumptuous demand that

 

[thinking] know the solution of the riddles and bring salvation.” 

(QB 72–73)

Now there is a certain difference between what Heidegger puts under erasure and what

 

Derrida does. “Being” is the master-word that Heidegger crosses out. Derrida does not reject

 

this. But his word is “trace” (the French word carries strong implications of track, footprint,

 

imprint), a word that cannot be a master-word, that presents itself as the mark of an anterior

 

presence, origin, master. For “trace” one can substitute “arche-writing” (“archi-écriture”), or

 

“difference,” or in fact quite a few other words that Derrida uses in the same way. But I shall

 

begin with “trace/

((xvi))

track,” for it is a simple word; and there also seems, I must admit, some-thing ritually

 

satisfying about beginning with the “trace.”

To be sure, when Heidegger sets Being before all concepts, he is attempt-ing to free language

 

from the fallacy of a fixed origin, which is also a fixed end. But, 

in a certain way, 

he also sets

 

up Being as what Derrida calls the “transcendental signified.” For whatever a concept might

 

“mean,” anything that is conceived of in its being-present must lead us to the already-

answered question of Being. In that sense, the sense of the final reference, Being is indeed the

 

final signified to which all signifiers refer. But Heidegger makes it clear that Being cannot be

 

contained by, is always prior to, in-deed transcends, signification. It is therefore a situation

 

where the signified commands, and is yet free of, all signifiers—a recognizably theological

 

situation. The end of philosophy, according to Heidegger, is to restore the memory of that free

 

and commanding signified, to discover 

Urwörter 

(originary words) in the languages of the

 

world by learning to waylay the limiting logic of signification, a project that Derrida describes

 

as “the other side of nostalgia, which I will call Heideggerian 

hope.... 

I . . . shall relate it to

 

what seems to me to be retained of metaphysics in [Heidegger’s] ‘Spruch des Anaximander,’

 

namely, the quest for the proper word and the unique name.” (MP 29, SP 159-60)




Derrida seems to show no nostalgia for a lost presence. He sees in the traditional concept of

 

the sign a hetereogeneity—“the other of the signified is never contemporary, is at best a subtly

 

discrepant inverse or parallel—discrepant by the time of a breath—of the order of the

 

signifier” (31, 

18

). It is indeed an ineluctable nostalgia for presence that makes of this

 

heterogeneity a unity by declaring that a sign brings forth the presence of the signified.

 

Otherwise it would seem clear that the sign is the place where “the completely other is

 

announced as such—without any simplicity, any identity, any resemblance or continuity—in

 

that which is not it” (69, 

47

). Word and thing or thought never in fact become one. We are

 

reminded of, referred to, what the convention of words sets up as thing or thought, by a

 

particular arrangement of words. The structure of reference works and can go on working not

 

because of the identity between these two so-called component parts of the sign, but because

 

of their relationship of difference. The sign marks a place of difference.

One way of satisfying the rage for unity is to say that, within the phonic sign (speech rather

 

than writing) there is no structure of difference; and that this nondifference is felt as self-

presence in the silent and solitary thought of the self. This is so familiar an argument that we

 

would accept it readily if we did not stop to think about it. But if we did, we would notice that

 

there is no necessary reason why a particular sound should be identical with a “thought or

 

thing”; and that the argument applies even when one “speaks” silently to oneself. Saussure

 

was accordingly obliged to

((xvii))

point out that the phonic signifier is as conventional as the graphic (74, 

51

)•

Armed with this simple yet powerful insight—powerful enough to “de-construct the

 

transcendental signified”—that the sign, phonic as well as graphic, is a structure of difference,

 

Derrida suggests that what opens the possibility of thought is not merely the question of

 

being, but also the never-annulled difference from “the completely other.” Such is the strange

 

“being” of the sign: half of it always “not there” and the other half always “not that.” The

 

structure of the sign is determined by the trace or track of that other which is forever absent.

 

This other is of course never to be found in its full being. As even such empirical events as

 

answering a child’s question or consulting the dictionary proclaim, one sign leads to another

 

and so on indefinitely. Derrida quotes Lambert and Peirce: “ ‘[philosophy should] reduce the

 

theory of things 

to the 

theory of signs.’ ... 

‘The idea of 

manifestation is 

the idea of a sign’ “

 

(72, 

49

), and contrasts them to Hus

serl and Heidegger. On the way to the trace/track, the word

 

“sign” has to be put under erasure: “the sign [is med kryss] that ill-named [thing med kryss],

 

the only one, that escapes the instituting question of philosophy: ‘What is . . . ?’ “

Derrida, then, gives the name “trace” to the part played by the radically other within the

 

structure of difference that is the sign. (I stick to “trace” in my translation, because it “looks

 

the same” as Derrida’s word; the reader must remind himself of at least the track, even the

 

spoor, contained within the French word.) In spite of itself, Saussurean linguistics recognizes

 

the structure of the sign to be a trace-structure. And Freud’s psychoanalysis, to some extent in

 

spite of itself, recognizes the structure of experience itself to be a trace-, not a presence-




structure. Following an argument analogical to the argument on the sign, Derrida puts the

 

word “experience” under erasure:

As for the concept of experience, it is most unwieldy here. Like all the notions I am using, it

 

belongs to the history of metaphysics and we can only use it under erasure. “Experience” has

 

always designated the relationship with a presence, whether that relationship had the form of

 

consciousness or not. Yet we must, by means of the sort of contortion and contention that

 

discourse is obliged to undergo, exhaust the resources of the concept of experience before

 

attaining and in order to attain, by deconstruction, its ultimate foundation. It is the only way to

 

escape “empiricism” and the “naive” critiques of experience at the same time (89, 6o).

Now we begin to see how Derrida’s notion of “sous rature” differs from that of Heidegger’s.

 

Heidegger’s [Being med kryss] might point at an inarticulable presence. Derrida’s [trace med

 

kryss]is the mark of the absence of a presence, an always already absent present, of the lack at

 

the origin that is the condi

tion of thought and experience. For somewhat different yet similar

((xviii))

contingencies, both Heidegger and Derrida teach us to use language in terms of a trace-

structure, effacing it even as it presents its legibility. We must remember this when we wish to

 

attack Derrida or, for that matter, Heidegger, on certain sorts of straightforward logical

 

grounds; for, one can always forget the invisible erasure, “act as though this makes no

 

difference.” (MP 3, SP 131) 13

Derrida writes thus on the strategy of philosophizing about the trace:

The value of the transcendental arche [origin] must make its necessity felt before letting itself

 

be erased. The concept of the arche-trace must comply with both that necessity and that

 

erasure. It is in fact contradictory and not accepta-ble within the logic of identity. The trace is

 

not only the disappearance of origin, ... it means that the origin did not even disappear, that it

 

was never constituted except reciprocally by a non-origin, the trace, which thus becomes the

 

origin of the origin. From then on, to wrench the concept of the trace from the classical

 

scheme which would derive it from a presence or from an originary non-trace and which

 

would make of it an empirical mark, one must indeed speak of an originary trace or arche-

trace (90, 61) .

At once inside and outside a certain Hegelian and Heideggerian tradi

tion, Derrida, then, is

 

asking us to change certain habits of mind: the authority of the text is provisional, the origin is

 

a trace; contradicting logic, we must learn to use and erase our language at the same time.

In the last few pages, we have seen Heidegger and Derrida engaged in the process of this

 

curious practice. Derrida in particular is acutely aware that it is a question of strategy. It is the

 

strategy of using the only avail-able language while not subscribing to its premises, or

 

“operat[ing] accord-ing to the vocabulary of the very thing that one delimits.” (MP 18, SP

 

147) For Hegel, as Hyppolite remarks, “philosophical discourse” contains “its own criticism

 

within itself.” (SC 336, 158) And Derrida, describing the strategy “of a discourse which

 




borrows from a heritage the resources neces

sary for the deconstruction of that heritage itself,”

 

remarks similarly, “language bears within itself the necessity of its own critique.” 

(ED 

416,

 

SC 254) The remark becomes clearer in the light of writing “sous rature”: “At each step I was

 

obliged to proceed by ellipses, corrections and cor-rections of corrections, letting go of each

 

concept at the very moment that I needed to use it, etc.”14

There is some similarity between this strategy and what Lévi-Strauss calls 

bricolage in La

 

pensée sauvage.

15 Derrida himself remarks:

Lévi-Strauss will always remain faithful to this double intention: to preserve as an instrument

 

that whose truth-value he criticizes, conserving . . . all these old concepts, while at the same

 

time exposing . . . their limits, treating them as tools which can still be of use. No longer is

 

any truth-value [or rigorous meaning] attributed to them; there is a readiness to abandon them

 

if necessary if other

((xix))

instruments should appear more useful. In the meantime, their relative efficacy is exploited,

 

and they are employed to destroy the old machinery to which they belong and of which they

 

themselves are pieces. Thus it is that the language of the human sciences criticizes 

itself. (ED

 

417; SC 255, 254)

One distinction between Lévi-Strauss and Derrida is clear enough. Lévi-Strauss’s

 

anthropologist seems free to pick his tool; Derrida’s philosopher knows that there is no tool

 

that does not belong to the metaphysical box, and proceeds from there. But there is yet

 

another difference, a difference that we must mark as we outline Derridean strategy.

Lévi-Strauss contrasts the 

bricoleur 

to the engineer. (“The ‘bricoleur’ has no precise

 

equivalent in English. He is a man who undertakes odd jobs and is a Jack of all trades or is a

 

kind of professional do-it-yourself man, but . . he is of a different standing from, for instance,

 

the English ‘odd job man’ or handyman.” 16) The discourse of anthropology and the other

 

sciences of man must be 

bricolage: 

the discourses of formal logic, and the pure sciences, one

 

presumes, can be those of engineering. The engineer’s “instru

ment” is “specially adapted to a

 

specific technical need”; the 

bricoleur 

makes do with things that were meant perhaps for other

 

ends. 17 The anthropologist must tinker because, at least as Lévi-Strauss argues in 

Le cru et le

 

cuit, 

it is in fact impossible for him to master the whole field. Derrida, by an important

 

contrast, suggests that the field is 

theoretically, 

not merely empirically, unknowable. 

(ED 

419

 

f., SC 259 f.) Not even in an ideal universe of an empirically reduced number of possibilities

 

would the projected “end” of knowledge ever coincide with its “means.” Such a coincidence

—“engineering”—is an impossible dream of plenitude. The reason for 

bricolage is 

that there

 

can be nothing else. No engineer can make the “means”—the sign—and the “end”—meaning

—become self-identical. Sign will always lead to sign, one substituting the other (play-fully,

 

since “sign” is “under erasure”) as signifier and signified in turn. Indeed, the notion of play is

 

important here. Knowledge is not a systematic tracking down of a truth that is hidden but may

 

be found. It is rather the field “of 

freeplay, 

that is to say, a field of infinite substitutions in the

 

closure of a finite ensemble.” 

(ED 

423, SC 260)

For Derrida, then, the concept of the “engineer” “questioning the uni-verse” is, like Hegel’s

 

father-text encompassing the son-preface, or Heideg

ger’s Being as transcendental signified, “a

 

theological idea,” an idea that we 

need 

to fulfill our desire for plenitude and authority. He

 




remarks that Lévi-Strauss, like Heidegger, is afflicted with nostalgia: “one . . . perceives in his

 

work a sort of ethic of presence, an ethic of nostalgia for origins, an ethic of archaic and

 

natural innocence, of a purity of presence and self-presence in speech—an ethic, nostalgia,

 

and even remorse which he often presents as the motivation of the ethnological project when

 

he moves toward archaic

((xx))

societies—exemplary societies in his eyes. These texts are well known.” 

(ED 

427, SC 264)

Derrida does not offer the obverse of this nostalgia. He does not see in the method of the so-

called exact sciences an epistemological model of exactitude. All knowledge, whether one

 

knows it or not, is a species of 

bricolage, 

with its eye on the myth of “engineering.” But that

 

myth is always totally other, leaving an originary trace within “bricolage.” Like all “useful”

 

words, “bricolage” must also be placed “under erasure.” For it can only be defined by its

 

difference from its opposite—“engineering.” Yet that opposite, a metaphysical norm, can in

 

fact never be present and thus, strictly speaking, there is no concept of “bricolage” (that which

 

is not engineering). Yet the concept must be used—untenable but necessary. “From the

 

moment that we cease to believe in such an engineer . . . as soon as it is admitted that every

 

finite discourse is bound by a certain 

bricolage, . . . 

the very idea of 

bricolage is 

menaced and

 

the difference in which it took on its meaning decomposes.” 

(ED 418, SC 

256) The possible

 

and implicit hierarchical move, reminding us that 

bricolage 

as a model is “pre-scientific,” low

 

on a chain of teleologic development, here disappears. Derrida does not allow the possibility

 

of seeing 

bricolage 

as a cruder, pre-scientific method of investigation, low on the

 

evolutionary scale. One can now begin to understand a rather cryptic sentence in the 

Gram

-

matology: 

“Without that track [of writing under erasure], . . . the ultra-transcendental text

 

[bricolage 

under erasure] will so closely resemble the pre-critical text 

[bricolage 

plain and

 

simple] as to be indistinguishable from it.” (90, 

61

)

This undoing yet preserving of the opposition between 

bricolage 

and engineering is an

 

analogue for Derrida’s attitude toward all oppositions—an attitude that “erases” (in this

 

special sense) all oppositions. I shall come back to this gesture again and again in this Preface.

(As he develops the notion of the joyful yet laborious strategy of rewrit

ing the old language—

a language, incidentally, we must know well—Der

rida mentions the “clôture” of

 

metaphysics. We must know that we are within the “clôture” of metaphysics, even as we

 

attempt to undo it. It would be an historicist mistake to represent this “closure” of

 

metaphysics as simply the temporal finishing-point of metaphysics. It is also the meta-

physical desire to make the end coincide with the means, create an 

en-

closure, make the

 

definition coincide with the defined, the “father” with the “son”; within the logic of identity to

 

balance the equation, close the circle. Our language reflects this desire. And so it is from

 

within this language that we must attempt an “opening.”)

((xxi))

II




Derrida uses the word “metaphysics” very simply as shorthand for any science of presence. (If

 

he were to attempt a rigorous definition of meta-physics, the word’ would no doubt go “under

 

erasure.”) But it is this simple 

bricoleur’s 

take on the word that permits Derrida to allow the

 

possibility of a “Marxist” or “structuralist” metaphysics. He puts it succinctly in that early

 

essay from which I have already quoted:

The history of metaphysics, like the history of the West, is the history of these metaphors and

 

metonymies 18 Its matrix—if you will pardon me for demon

strating so little and for being so

 

elliptical in order to bring me more quickly to my principal theme—is the determination of

 

being as 

presence 

in all the senses of this word. It would be possible to show that all the

 

names related to funda

mentals, to principles, or to the center have always designated the

 

constant of a presence—eidos, 

archè, telos, energeia, ousia 

(essence, existence, substance,

 

sub

ject) 

aletheia, 

transcendentality, consciousness, or conscience, God, man, and so forth.

 

(ED 

410-11, SC 249)

I have lingered on the “question of the preface” and the pervasive Der

ridean practice of the

 

“sous rature” to slip into the atmosphere of Derrida’s thought. Now I speak of his

 

acknowledged “precursors”—Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, Husserl. 19 I shall attend in

 

greatest detail to Nietzsche because our received version of him is so different from Derrida’s,

 

and because Derrida’s relationship to him is so inescapable. I shall then comment on Derrida’s

 

attitudes toward structuralism; on his own vocabu

lary and practice and on the structure of the

 

Grammatology. A 

few words next about translation, and we are into the text.

Derrida has given us two lists of what we should look for in Nietzsche: “the systematic

 

mistrust of metaphysics as a whole, the formal approach to philosophic discourse, the concept

 

of the philosopher-artist, the rhetorical and philological question asked of the history of

 

philosophy, the suspicion of the values of truth (‘well applied convention’), of meaning and of

 

being, of ‘meaning of being’, the attention to the economic phenomena of force and of

 

difference of forces, and so forth.” (MP 362–63) And, “Radi

calizing the concepts of

 

interpretation, perspective, evaluation, difference ... 

Nietzsche, far from remaining 

simply

 

(with Hegel and as Heidegger wished) 

within 

metaphysics, contributed a great deal to the

 

liberation of the signifier from its dependence or derivation with respect to the logos, and the

 

related concept of truth or the primary signified . . .” (p-32, 19).

((xxii))

It should by now be clear that Nietzsche’s “suspicion of the value of truth . . . of meaning and

 

of being, of ‘meaning of being’ “ of the “concept of . . . the primary signified,” is intimately

 

shared by Derrida. The other items on the two lists can be brought under one head:

 

philosophical dis-course as formal, rhetorical, figurative discourse, a something to be de-

ciphered. The end of this Preface will make clear how deeply Derrida is committed to such a

 

notion. Here I shall comment on the implications of “the decipherment of figurative

 

discourse” in Nietzsche.

As early as 1873, Nietzsche described metaphor as the originary process of what the intellect

 

presents as “truth.” “The intellect, as a means for the preservation of the individual, develops

 

its chief power in dissimulation.” 20 “A nerve-stimulus, first transcribed 

[übertragen] 

into an

 

image 

[Bild]! 

First metaphor! The image again copied into a sound! Second metaphor! And

 




each time he [the creator of language] leaps completely out of one sphere right into the midst

 

of an entirely different one.” 

(NW 

III. 

ii. 

373, TF 178) In its simplest outline, Nietzsche’s

 

definition of metaphor seems to be the establishing of an identity between dissimilar things.

 

Nietzsche’s phrase is “Gleich machen” (make equal), calling to mind the German word

 

“Gleichnis”—image, simile, similitude, comparison, allegory, parable—an unmistakable

 

pointer to figurative practice in general. “Every idea origi

nates through equating the unequal.”

 

(NW 

III. 

ii. 

374, TF 179) “What, therefore, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors,

 

metonymies, anthropo

morphisms; . . . truths are illusions of which one has forgotten that they

 

are 

illusions, . . . coins which have their obverse effaced and now are no longer of account as

 

coins but merely as metal.” 

(NW 

III. 

ii. 

374-75, TF 18o) I hold on here to the notions of a

 

process of figuration and a process of forgetfulness.

In this early text, Nietzsche describes the figurative drive as “that im-pulse towards the

 

formation of metaphors, that fundamental impulse of man, which we cannot reason away for

 

one moment—for thereby we should reason away man himself. . . . 

(NW 

III. 

ii. 

381, TF 188)

 

Later he will give this drive the name “will to power.” Our so-called will to truth is a will to

 

power because “the so-called drive for knowledge can be traced back to a drive to appropriate

 

and conquer.” 21 Nietzsche’s sense of the in

evitable forcing of the issue, of exercising power,

 

comes through in his italics: “ ‘Thinking’ in primitive conditions (preorganic) is the

 

crystalliza

tion of forms. . . . In our thought, the essential feature is fitting new mate-rial into

 

old schemas, . . . 

making 

equal what is new.” 22

The human being has nothing more to go on than a collection of nerve stimuli. And, because

 

he or she must be secure in the knowledge of, and therefore power over, the “world” (inside

 

or outside), the nerve stimuli are explained and described through the categories of figuration

 

that masquerade as the categories of “truth.” These explanations and

((xxiii))

descriptions are “interpretations” and reflect a human inability to tolerate undescribed chaos

—“that the collective character 

[Gesamtcharakter] 

of the world . . . is in all eternity chaos—

in the sense not of a lack of necessity but of a lack of order, arrangement, form, beauty,

 

wisdom, and whatever other names there are for our aesthetic anthropomorphisms [human

 

weaknesses—Menschlichkeiten].”23 

As Nietzsche suggests, this need for power through

 

anthropomorphic defining compels humanity to create an unending proliferation of

 

interpretations whose only “origin,” that shudder in the nerve strings, being a direct sign of

 

nothing, leads to no primary signified. As Derrida writes, Nietzsche provides an “entire

 

thematics of active interpretations, which substitutes an incessant deciphering for the

 

disclosure of truth as a presentation of the thing itself.” 

(MP 

19, SP 149)

Interpretation is “the introduction of meaning” (or “deception through 

meaning

”—

Sinnhineinlegen), a 

making-sign that is a making-figure, for there is, in this thought, no

 

possibility of a literal, true, self-identical mean-ing. Identification 

(Gleich-machen) 

constitutes

 

the act of figuration. Therefore, “nothing is ever comprehended, but rather designated and dis

-

torted....” This extends, of course, to the identity between an act (effect) and its purpose

 

(cause) : “Every single time something is done with a purpose in view, something

 

fundamentally different and other occurs.” (WM H. 59, 130; WP 301, 351) The will to power

 

is a process of “incessant deciphering”—figurating, interpreting, sign-ifying through ap-

parent identification. Thus, even supposing that an act could be isolated within its outlines, to

 

gauge the relationship between it and its “originat

ing” consciousness, the critical glance must

 




reverse (necessarily nonidenti

callv) this decipherment, follow the 

“askew 

path,” read the act

 

in its textuality. In this important respect, “without him [Nietzsche] the ‘ques

tion’ of the text

 

would never have erupted, at least in the precise sense that it has taken today.”24

In 

The Genealogy of Morals, 

Nietzsche reads the history of morality as a text. He interprets

 

the successive 

meanings 

of systems of morality. “Pur-poses and utilities are only 

signs 

that a

 

will to power has become master of something less powerful and has in turn imprinted the

 

meaning of a function upon it 

[ihm von sich aus den Sinn einer Funktion 

auf geprägt 

hat;

 

this image of 

Au f 

prägung—imprinting—‘figuration’ in yet another sense, is most important

 

in Nietzsche, and constantly recurs in this particu

lar context]; and the entire history of a

 

‘thing’, an organ, a custom can in this way be a continuous sign-chain of ever new

 

interpretations and make-shift excuses 

[Zurechtmachungen] 

whose causes do not even have

 

to be re

lated to one another in a purely chance fashion.”25 “All concepts in which an entire

 

process is semiotically telescoped 

[Zusammenfasst] 

elude defini

tion.” 

(NW, VI. ii. 

333, GM

 

8o) Derrida would, of course, suspend the entire notion of semiosis, put the sign under

 

erasure. It is possible to read

((xxiv))

such a suspension into Nietzsche’s “continuous sign-chains,” without origin and end in

 

“truth.” And thus it is possible to discover an affinity between Derrida’s practice in 

Of

 

Grammatology 

and Nietzsche’s interpretation of value systems as infinite textuality; and to

 

see in Derrida’s decipherment of the negative valuation of writing within the speech-writing

 

hierarchy the mark of a Nietzschean “genealogy.”

But it is also possible to criticize Nietzsche’s indefinite expansion of the notion of

 

metaphoricity or figuration as a gesture that turns back upon itself. “Nietzsche stretches the

 

limits of the metaphorical,” Derrida writes:

to such a point that he attributes metaphorical power to every use of sound in speaking: for

 

does this not involve the transfer into the time of speaking of something that has a different

 

nature in itself? . . . Strangely enough, this comes down to treating every signifier as a

 

metaphor for the signified, while the classical concept of metaphor denotes only the

 

substitution of one signified for another so that the one becomes the signifier of the other. Is

 

not Nietzsche’s procedure here precisely to extend to every element of discourse, under the

 

name 

metaphor, 

what classical rhetoric no less strangely considered a quite specific figure of

 

speech, 

metonymy of the sign 

[that the sign as “a part” 

stood for 

“the whole” meaning]?”26

We should, of course, note that Derrida’s criticism is framed in two ques

tions, rather than in a

 

series of declarations. Yet, even if we were to take only the declarative sentence in our

 

passage, it would be clear that Derrida criticizes Nietzsche precisely because what Nietzsche

 

deciphers he holds decipherable and because metaphor (or figure) so vastly expanded could

 

simply become the name of the process of signification rather than a critique of that process.

 

It would be more acceptable if Nietzsche had put metaphor, or figure, or interpretation, or

 

perspective, or, for that matter, truth, under erasure. I shall suggest that a move toward such an

 

erasure may be traced through Nietzsche’s critique of consciousness and the “subject.” When

 

the outlines of the “subject” are loosened, the concepts of figuration or metaphoricity—related

 

to meaning-ful-ness,—are subsumed under the broader categories of appropriation and the

 

play of resistant forces. The word “metaphor” is seen to be used “sous rature,” 

as 

a

 




methodological convenience, for it refers to a more encompassing structure not necessarily

 

involved in meaning-making. Let us follow the unfolding of this pattern.

The “subject” is a unified concept and therefore the result of “interpre

tation.” Nietzsche often

 

stresses that it is a specifically linguistic figurative habit of immemorial standing: “that when

 

it is thought 

[wenn gedacht wird] 

there must be something ‘that thinks’ is simply a

 

formulation of our grammatical custom that adds a doer to every deed.” (WM II. 13, WP 268)

 

The “

insertion of a subject” is “fictitious.” (WM 

II. no, WP 337) The will to power as the

 

subject’s 

metaphorizing or figurating, or intro-

((xxv))

duction of meaning, must therefore be questioned. And Nietzsche accord

ingly asks, pondering

 

on the “making equal” of proximate sensations, a propos of how 

“images . . . 

then 

words, . . .

 

finally 

concepts 

arise in the spirit”: “Thus confusion of two sensations that are close

 

neighbors, as we take note of these sensations; but 

who is 

taking note?” 

(WM 

II. 23, WP 275)

 

Nietzsche accordingly entertains the notion of the will to power as an abstract and unlocalized

 

figurative (interpretative) process: “One may not ask: ‘who then interprets?’ for the

 

interpretation itself is a form of the will to power, exists (but not as a ‘being’ but as a process,

 

a be-coming) as an affect.” 

(WM 

II. 61, WP 302)

Sometimes Nietzsche places this abstract will to power, an incessant figuration, not under the

 

control of any knowing subject, but rather under-ground, in the unconscious. The Nietzschean

 

unconscious is that vast arena of the mind of which the so-called “subject” knows nothing. As

 

Derrida remarks: “both [Freud and Nietzsche] . . . often in a very similar way, questioned the

 

self-assured certitude of consciousness. . . . For Nietzsche ‘the important main activity is

 

unconscious.’ “ (MP 18, SP 148)

If, however, we want to hold onto “the important main activity” we have to go further than the

 

unconscious, we have to reach the body, the organism. If the “unconscious” is unknown to us,

 

how much more so the body! Already in the early essay “On Truth and Falsity in their

 

Ultramoral Sense,” the connections are being established:

What indeed 

does 

man know about himself? . . . Does not nature keep secret from him most

 

things, even about his body, e.g., the convolutions of the in

testines, the quick flow of the

 

blood-currents, the intricate vibration of the fibres, so as to banish and lock him up in proud,

 

delusive knowledge? Nature threw away the keys and woe to the fateful curiosity which

 

might be able for a moment to look out and down through a crevice in the chamber of

 

conscious

ness, and discover that man indifferent to his own ignorance, is resting on the

 

pitiless, the greedy, the insatiable, the murderous, and, as it were, hanging in dreams on the

 

back of a tiger. Whence, in the wide world, with this state of affairs, arise the impulse of

 

truth? (NW III. ii, 371, TF 175–76)

Here is the early signal for a sweeping question like this one in 

The Gay Science: 

“The

 

unconscious disguise of physiological needs under the cloaks of the objective, ideal, purely

 

spiritual goes to frightening lengths—and often I have asked myself whether, taking a large

 

view philosophy has not been merely an interpretation of the body and a 

misunderstanding of

 

the body.” (NW V. ii. 

16, GS 34–35) A yet more sweeping declarative frag-ment: “Our most

 

sacred convictions, the unchanging elements in our supreme values, are judgments of our

 

muscles.” 

(WM I. 

370, WP 173) It is as if that controlling figurative practice that constitutes

 




all our cogni

tion is being handed over to the body. And indeed Nietzsche’s speculation goes

 

further. “Making equal” is seen as a symptom of being animate, rather

((xxvi))

than the “privilege” of being human; the will to power “appropriates” in the organism, before

 

the “name of man” may be broached: “All thought, judgment, perception, as comparison

 

[Gleichnis] 

has as its precondition a ‘positing of equality’ 

[Gleichsetzen], 

and earlier still a

 

‘making 

equal’ 

[Gleich-machen]. 

The process of making equal is the same as the incorpo

-

ration of appropriated material in the amoeba . . . [and] corresponds ex

actly to that external,

 

mechanical process (which is its symbol) by which protoplasm continually makes what it

 

appropriates equal to itself and arranges it into its own forms and ranks 

[in seine Reihen and

 

Formen einordnet].” (WM 

II. 21, 25; WP 

273–74, 276) 

Appropriation and its symbol, making

 

equal, positing as equal—the process operates in the organic universe for its own preservation

 

and constitution before the human con

sciousness appropriates it and declares it the process of

 

the discovery of truth, the establishment of knowledge. The process differentiates itself into

 

the mapping of the moral universe: “Is it virtuous when a cell transforms itself into a function

 

of a stronger cell? It has to do so 

[Sie muss es]. 

And is it evil when the stronger cell

 

assimilates the weaker? . . . Joy and desire appear together in the stronger that wants to

 

transform something into its function, joy and the wish to be desired appear together in the

 

weaker that wants to become a function.” (NW V. ii. 154, 

GS 

175–76) Here the rela

tionship

 

between figuration on the one hand, and appropriation, the play of forces, on the other, comes

 

clear. Speaking of the human will to truth, linguistic figuration is the figure Nietzsche must

 

employ. Moving “back” into the organism in general, differentiations among goodness,

 

strength, truth begin to blur; appropriation comes to be a more embracing term than

 

interpretation. Admittedly, this neutralizing rigor is not often 

explicit 

in Nietzsche. But when

 

it is operative, the irreducible description of the will to power as a search for what is resistant

 

to itself emerges. “The will to power can manifest itself only against resistances; therefore it

 

seeks that which resists it. . . .” 

(WM 

II 123, WP 346) Consider also that curious series of

 

notes, made between November 1887 and March 1888, where Nietzsche tries to bypass

 

language to express what we can crudely call the will to power as the play of will and no-will.

 

It is worth mediating upon the entire passage. Here I quote selectively to give a sense of the

 

problem:

There are no durable ultimate units, no atoms, no monads; here, too, beings are only

 

introduced by us.... “Value” is essentially the standpoint for the increase or decrease of these

 

dominating centers (“multiplicities” in any case, but “units” are nowhere present in the nature

 

of becoming) . Linguistic means of expression are useless for expressing “becoming”; it

 

accords with our in

evitable need to preserve ourselves to posit a crude world of stability, of

 

“things,” etc. We may venture to speak of atoms and monads in a relative sense; and it is

 

certain that the smallest world is most durable—There is no will: there are

((xxvii))

punctuations of will 

[Willens-Punktationen] 

that are constantly increasing or losing their

 

power. (WM II. 171–72, WP 38o–81)

Nietzsche uses the time-honored figure of the point 

(stigmè) 27 

only as the relatively safest

 

image of a unit, and even then not as a sign for dura

bility or continuity, but rather as the

 

participant in a disjunctive periodicity of (positive 

or 

negative) energizing, a punctuation

 




perhaps also in the sense of the deployment of space as constituting what is usually taken to

 

be a temporal or historical continuity. As we shall see later, the structural com

plicity here with

 

Freud’s psychic time-machine is striking. For the moment our argument is that in this strained

 

and hedged image of the 

Willens-Punktationen 

(where it is not even clear if the topic is the

 

restricted human will or the principle of the will to power—for who, after all, can “linguisti

-

cally express” the will to power?), Nietzche’s theory of metaphoricity or figuration explodes

 

into “sous rature” and neutralizes into a play of resisting forces. This is how I must interpret

 

Derrida’s comment, made outside of the context of Nietzsche’s theory of metaphor: “. . . the

 

‘active’ (in movement) discord of the different forces and of the differences between forces

 

which Nietzsche opposes to the entire system of metaphysical grammar.” (MP 19, SP 149)

Now if the “subject” is thus put in question, it is clear that the phi

losopher creating his system

 

must distrust himself as none other. And indeed Nietzsche articulates this problem often. He

 

couches his boldest insights in the form of questions that we cannot dismiss as a rhetorical

 

ploy. Writing on “The Uses and Abuses of History” as early as 1874, he warns us: “And this

 

present treatise, as I will not attempt to deny, shows the modern note of a weak personality in

 

the intemperateness of its criti

cism, the unripeness of its humanity, in the too frequent

 

transitions from irony to cynicism, from arrogance to scepticism.”28 The spirit of self-

diagnosis is strong in every Nietzschean text. “Every society has the tendency to reduce its

 

opponents to caricatures—at least in imagination—... Among immoralists it is the moralist:

 

Plato, for example, becomes a caricature in my hands.” 

(WM 

I. 410–11, WP 202) Quite in

 

passing, he places a warning frame around all his philosophizing: “One seeks a picture of the

 

world in 

that 

philosophy in which we feel freest; i.e., in which our most powerful drive feels

 

free to function. This will also be the case with me!” (WM I. 410–11, WP 224–25) In a

 

passage in 

The Gay Science, 

he spells out his version of the particular problem that leads

 

Heidegger and Derrida to writing under erasure:

How far the perspective character of existence extends or indeed whether existence has any

 

other character than this; whether existence without interpreta

tion, without “sense,” does not

 

become “nonsense”; whether, on the other

((xxviii))

hand, all existence is not essentially an 

interpreting 

existence 

[ein 

auslegendes 

Dasein]—that

 

cannot be decided even by the most industrious and most scrupu

lously conscientious analysis

 

and self-examination of the intellect; for in the course of this analysis the human intellect

 

cannot avoid seeing itself in its own perspective forms 

[perspektivische Form]„ 

and 

only 

in

 

these. We cannot look around our own corner. (NW V. ii. 308, GS 336)

Instances can be multiplied. But we must not only record Nietzsche’s awareness of this

 

problem, but of some of his ways of coping with it. One of them might be Nietzsche’s

 

pervasive strategy of intersubstituting oppo

sites. If one is always bound by one’s perspective,

 

one can at least delib

erately reverse perspectives as often as possible, in the process undoing

 

opposed perspectives, showing that the two terms of an opposition are merely accomplices of

 

each other. It would take a detailed analysis of Nietzschean practice to demonstrate what I am

 

merely going to suggest here: the notion that the setting up of unitary opposites is an

 

instrument and a consequence of “making equal,” and the dissolving of opposites is the

 

philosopher’s gesture against that will to power which would mystify her very self. Here let a

 

representative remark suffice: “There are no oppo

sites: only from those of logic do we derive

 

the concept of opposites—and falsely transfer it to things.” (WM II. 56, WP 298)




I have already dwelt on Nietzsche’s problematizing of the opposition between “metaphor” and

 

“concept,” “body” and “mind.” Any sampling of Nietzsche’s writing would be crosshatched

 

with such undoings. Here are a few provocative examples, which I append so that the reader

 

may sense their implicit or explicit workings as she reads the 

Grammatology:

Subject and Object; both a matter of interpretation: “No, [objective] facts are precisely what

 

there is not, only interpretations. We cannot estab

lish any fact ‘in itself’ . . . ‘Everything is

 

subjective,’ you say; but even this is interpretation. The subject is not something given, it is a

 

superadded in

vention, stuck on to the tail 

[etwas Hinzu-Erdichtetes, Dahinter-Gesteck

tes].

”

 

(WM II. 11—12, WP 267)

Truth and error; no “truth” at the origin, but “truths” and “errors”—neither description more

 

accurate than the other—cast up by the waves of control-preserving interpretations: “What are

 

man’s truths after all? They are man’s 

irrefutable 

errors.” (NW V. ii 196, GS 219) “Truth is

 

the kind of error without which a certain species of living being could not live.” (WM 19, WP

 

272)

Good and evil (morality and immorality) : “An absurd presupposition ... takes good and evil

 

for realities that contradict one another (not as complementary value concepts). . . .” (WM I.

 

397, WP 192) “Morality itself is a special case of immorality.” (WM I. 431, WP 217)

Theory and practice: “Dangerous distinction between ‘theoretical’ and ‘practical’ . . . as if

 

pure spirituality produced 

[vorlege] . . . 

the problems of

((xxix))

knowledge and metaphysics;— . . . as if practice must be judged by its own measure,

 

whatever the answer of theory might turn out to be 

[ausfalle].” 

(WM I.481, WP 251)

Purpose and accident, death and life: “Once you know that there are no purposes, you also

 

know that there is no accident, for it is only beside a world of purposes that the word

 

‘accident’ has meaning. Let us beware of saying that death is opposed to life. The living is

 

merely a type of what is dead, and a very rare type.” (NW V. ii. 146, GS 168; again, the

 

complicity with Freud’s speculations about the individual, organic life, and inertia is striking.)

 

29

Nietzsche’s undoing of opposites is a version of Derrida’s practice of undoing them through

 

the concept of “differance” (deferment-difference), which I discuss later. Derrida himself

 

notes the affinity:

We could thus take up all the coupled oppositions on which philosophy is constructed, and

 

from which our language lives, not in order to see opposition vanish but to see the emergence

 

of a necessity such that one of the terms ap-pears as the differance of the other, the other as

 

“differed” within the systematic ordering 

[l’économie] 

of the same (e.g., the intelligible as

 

differing from the sensible, as sensible differed; the concept as differed-differing intuition, life

 

as differed-differing matter; mind as differed-differing life; culture as differed-differing

 

nature....). In Nietzsche, these are so many themes that can be related with the

 

symptomatology that always diagnoses the evasions and ruses of anything disguised in its

 

differance. 

(MP 

18—19, SP 148—49)




One attempt at a holding action against the impossibility of breaking out of the enclosure of

 

“interpretation” is a “plural style.” In an essay translated as “The Ends of Man,” Derrida

 

writes: “As Nietzsche said, it is perhaps a change of style that we need; Nietzsche has

 

reminded us that, if there is style, it must be 

plural.” 30 

And, much later, “the question of

 

style can and must try its strength against the grand question of the interpretation, of, simply,

 

interpretation, to resolve or disqualify it in its statement.” (QS 253) The confounding of

 

opposites, with the attendant switching of perspective, might be an example of that plural

 

style. And so might Nietzsche’s use of many registers of discourse in such works as 

Thus

 

Spoke Zarathustra, The Gay Science, 

and 

Ecce 

Homo, or Derrida’s shifts between

 

commentary, interpretation, “fiction,” in the works immediately following Of 

Grammatology

 

and his typographical play with modes of dis-course in 

Marges 

or 

Glas.

Perhaps Nietzsche’s boldest insight in the face of the inescapable boundary is an exhortation

 

to the will to ignorance: “It is not enough that you understand in what ignorance man and

 

beast live; you must also have and acquire the 

will 

to ignorance.” (WM II. 98, WP 328) What

 

is more conventionally called “joyful unwisdom” (NW III. i. 252, UA 15) in an

((xxx))

early text is later named “joyful wisdom”—the gay science—and seen as the greatest threat to

 

the chain of self-preservative interpretations that accepts its own activity as “true” and

 

“good”: “The greatest danger that always hovered over humanity and still hovers over it is the

 

eruption of 

madness—

which means the eruption of arbitrariness in feeling, seeing, and

 

hearing, the enjoyment of the mind’s lack of discipline, the joy in human un-reason. Not truth

 

and certainty are the opposite of the world of the madman, but the universality and the

 

universal binding force of a faith; in sum, the nonarbitrary character of judgments.” 

(NW V. ii.

 

107–08, GS 130) 

The will to ignorance, the joyful wisdom, must also be prepared to rejoice in

 

uncertainty, to rejoice in and even to will the reversal of all values that might have come to

 

seem tenable: “No longer joy in certainty but in uncertainty . . . no longer will to preservation

 

but to power....” 

(WM 

II. 

395, WP 545)

This continual risk-taking is the affirmative play in Nietzsche that Der-rida will often

 

comment on. “I do not know any other way,” Nietzsche writes, “of associating with great

 

tasks than 

play.”

31 “Wisdom: that seems to the rabble to be a kind of flight, an artifice and

 

means for getting one-self out of a dangerous game; but the genuine philosopher—as he

 

seems to us, my friends?—lives ‘unphilosophically’ and ‘unwisely,’ above all 

im-prudently, . .

 

. 

he risks 

himself 

constantly, he plays the dangerous game.”32 This imprudence, constantly

 

attempting to bypass the prudence of stabiliz

ing through “interpretation,” is 

amor fati, 

the

 

love of what Derrida calls “the game of chance with necessity, of contingency with law.” (Dis

 

309) 

This is the dance of the Over-man, a dance Nietzsche describes in terms of himself with

 

a certain poignancy: “How wonderful and new and yet how gruesome and ironic I find my

 

position vis-à-vis the whole of existence in the light of my insight! . . . I suddenly woke up in

 

the midst of this dream, but only to the consciousness that I am dreaming and that I 

must 

go

 

on dreaming lest I perish—.... Among all these dreamers, I, too, who ‘know,’ am dancing my

 

dance.” (NW V. ii. 

90-91, GS 

116)

The “knowledge” of the philosopher places him among the dreamers, for knowledge is a

 

dream. But the philosopher “knowingly” agrees to dream, to dream of knowledge, agrees to

 

“forget” the lesson of philosophy, only so as to “prove” that lesson. . . . It is a vertiginous

 

movement that can go on indefinitely or, to use Nietzschean language, return eternally. This

 




pre-carious 

“forgetfulness,” 

“active 

forgetfulness,” is 

what Derrida emphasizes in Nietzsche’s

 

Over-man. He writes, again in “The Ends of Man”:

His [the Over-man’s] laughter will then break out towards a return which will no longer have

 

the form of the metaphysical return of humanism any more than it will undoubtedly take the

 

form, “beyond” metaphysics, of the memorial or of the guard of the sense of the being, or the

 

form of the house and the truth

((xxxi))

of Being. He will dance, outside of the house, that “aktive Vergeszlichkeit,” that active

 

forgetfulness (“oubliance”) and that cruel (grausam) feast [which] is spoken of in 

The

 

Genealogy of Morals. 

No doubt Nietzsche called upon an active forgetfulness (“oubliance”)

 

of Being which would not have had the metaphysical form which Heidegger ascribed to it.

 

(MP 

163, 

EM 57)

Like everything else in Nietzsche, this forgetfulness is at least double-edged. Even in his early

 

writings “forgetfulness” makes its appearance in two opposed forms: as a limitation that

 

protects the human being from the blinding light of an absolute historical memory (that will,

 

among other things, reveal that “truths” spring from “interpretations”), as well as an attribute

 

boldly chosen by the philosopher in order to avoid falling into the trap of “historical

 

knowledge.” In the work of the seventies, there are, on the one hand, passages such as the

 

following (in which we must grasp the full irony of the word “truth”) :

We do not yet know whence the impulse to truth comes, for up to now we have heard only

 

about the obligation which society imposes in order to exist: to be truthful, that is, to use the

 

usual metaphors, therefore expressed morally: we have heard only about the obligation to lie

 

according to a fixed convention, to lie gregariously in a style binding for all. Now man of

 

course forgets that matters are going thus with him; he therefore lies in that fashion pointed

 

out uncon

sciously and according to habits of centuries’ standing—and by 

this very uncon

-

sciousness, 

by this very forgetting, he arrives at a sense for truth. (NW III. ii. 

375, IF 

180–81)

If we appreciate the full irony of this passage, it becomes impossible for us to take a passage

 

such as the following, also written in the seventies, at face value, with the “historical sense” as

 

the unquestioned villain (although, admittedly, we must make a distinction between an

 

academic and pre

servative [on the one hand] and a philosophic and destructive [on the other],

 

sense of history) : “The historical sense makes its servants passive and retrospective. Only in

 

moments of forgetfulness, when that sense is intermittent 

[intermittirt; 

compare the

 

discontinuous energizing of 

Willens-Punktationen], 

does the man who is sick of the historical

 

fever ever act.” 

(NW 

III. 

i. 

301, 

UA 68) 

And through this network of shifting values, we begin

 

to glimpse the complexity of the act of 

choosing 

forgetfulness, already advanced as a partial

 

solution to the problem of history in the same early essay: “. . . the antidotes of history are the

 

‘unhistorical’ and the ‘super-historical.’ . . . By the word ‘unhistorical’ I mean the power, the

 

art of 

for-getting, 

and of drawing a limited horizon round one’s self.” 

(NW 

III. 

i. 326, UA 95)

I am not going to comment extensively on Nietzsche’s thought of for

getfulness, but simply

 

remark that, even in the passage in 

The Genealogy

((xxxii))




of Morals 

to which Derrida expressly refers, this ambivalence is clearly marked. The joyous

 

affirmative act of forgetfulness is also a deliberate repression:

Forgetting is no mere 

vis inertiae 

as the superficial imagine; it is rather an active and in the

 

strictest sense positive faculty of repression 

[Hemmungsvermögen], 

that is responsible for the

 

fact that what we experience and absorb enters our consciousness as little while we are

 

digesting it (one might call the process “inpsychation”) as does the thousandfold process,

 

involved in physical nourish

ment—so-called “incorporation.” To close the doors and

 

windows of conscious

ness for a time; to remain undisturbed by the noise and struggle of our

 

under-world of utility organs working with and against one another; a little quietness, a little

 

tabula rasa of the consciousness, to make room for new thing, above all for the nobler

 

functions and functionaries, for regulation, foresight, premedita

tion (for our organism is

 

oligarchicallv directed 

[oligarchisch eingerichtet] )—

that is the purpose of active

 

forgetfulness, which is like a doorkeeper, a preserver of psychic order, repose, and etiquette:

 

so that it will be immediately obvious how there could be no happiness, no cheerfulness, no

 

hope, no pride, no 

present, 

without forgetfulness. 

(NW VI. ii., 307–08; GM 57–58)

“

Knowing” that there is nowhere an isolatable unit, not even an atomistic one, and that

 

conceptions of a unified present are merely an interpretation, the philosopher, by an act of

 

“forgetting” that knowledge, wins himself a “present.” Within that created frame he, who has

 

doubted the possibility of any stable morality, any possibility of truth, nonetheless speaks in

 

one of the strongest polemical voices in European thought, not only taking sides but

 

demolishing his opponents. Nietzsche’s work is the unreconciled playground of this

 

“knowledge” and this “forgetfulness,” the establishment of the knowledge (that presents all

 

knowing as mere symptom) as con

vincing as the voice of forgetfulness (that gives us the most

 

memorable prophecy). The most common predicament in the reading of Nietzsche is to defeat

 

oneself in the effort to establish a coherence between the two. But the sustaining of the

 

incoherence, to make the two poles in a curious way interdependent,—that is Nietzsche’s

 

superb trick. 

What 

Nietzsche’s 

style 

brings off here is, to borrow a Derridean pun, what the

 

stylus 

per-forms when, in the gesture of “sous rature,” it deletes and leaves legible at the same

 

time. A hint is lodged in Nietzsche’s own description of “the psychological problem in the

 

type of Zarathustra:” “how he that says No and 

does 

No to an unheard-of degree, to

 

everything to which one has so far said Yes, can nevertheless be the opposite of a No-saying

 

spirit.”33

Martin Heidegger, as we have seen, dreams of annulling a first forgetful

ness of the question of

 

Being. For him, “all fundamental-ontological con

struction 

[fundamental-ontologische

 

Konstruktion] . . . 

must in its plan 

[im Entwerfen] 

wrest from forgetfulness that which is

 

planned 

[in den Entwurf Genommene]. 

The basic, fundamental-ontological act of the

 

metaphysics

((xxxiii))

of 

Dasein 

is, therefore, a “remembering back 

[Wiedererinnerung].”34 

It is thus through the

 

notion of an 

active 

forgetfulness that Nietzsche, Derrida believes, gives Heidegger the slip. To

 

recall the passage from Derrida that I have already quoted, the “laughter” of the Over-man

 

will not be a “memorial or . . . guard of the . . . form of the house and the truth of Being. He

 

will dance, outside of the house, this . . . active forgetfulness.”




Heidegger stands between Derrida and Nietzsche. 

Almost on every oc

casion that Derrida

 

writes of Nietzsche, Heidegger’s reading is invoked. It is as if Derrida discovers his Nietzsche

 

through and against Heidegger. In the 

Grammatology, 

he writes: “. . . rather than protect

 

Nietzsche from the Heideggerian reading, we should perhaps offer him up to it completely,

 

underwriting that interpretation without reserve; in a 

certain way 

and up to the point where,

 

the content of the Nietzschean discourse being almost lost for the question of being, its form

 

regains its absolute strange

ness, where his text finally invokes a different type of reading,

 

more faithful to his type of writing.” (32, 19)

Heidegger describes Nietzsche as the last metaphysician of the West. For Heidegger a

 

metaphysician is one who asks the question “What is the being of the entity?” And, for

 

Heidegger, Nietzsche’s answer to this ques

tion is—the being of the entity is the will to power.

 

And, as Heidegger has consistently pointed out, the place for the posing of the question of the

 

being of the entity is man. Starting from this “metaphysical premise” Heidegger develops a

 

thoroughly coherent reading of Nietzsche and re-minds us again and again that to consider

 

Nietzsche incoherent is simply not to grasp that his master-question is the same as that of all

 

Western metaphysics: “What is the being of the entity?” It is as if Heidegger, phi

losopher of

 

that special nostalgia for the original word, resolutely refuses to recognize that Nietzsche’s

 

consistency is established by virtue of an active forgetfulness the conditions for which are

 

also inscribed in the Nietzschean text.

Heidegger often quotes a sentence from Nietzsche and declares “this means . . . .” Out of this

 

highly didactic approach comes powerful formulae such as the following:

We shall be able to determine the main thrust of Nietzche’s metaphysical premise, when we

 

consider the answer that he gives to the question of the 

constitution 

of the entity and its 

mode

 

of being. . . . 

Nietzsche gives two answers: the entity in its totality is will to power, and the

 

entity in its totality is the eternal return of the same. ...In these two propositions . . . “is”

 

means different things. The entity in totality “is” the will to power means: the entity as such is

 

constituted as that which Nietzsche determines as the will to power. And the entity in totality

 

“is” the eternal return of the same means the entity in totality is as entity in the mode of the

 

eternal return of the same. The determination “will to power” answers the question of the

 

entity 

with ref-

((xxxiv))

erence to its constitution; 

the determination “eternal return of the same” answers the question

 

of the entity in totality 

with reference to its mode of being. 

However, constitution and mode of

 

being belong together as determinations of the entity-ness of the entity 35

Everything is made to fall into place in terms of the question of being. That in Nietzsche

 

concepts such as “entity” and “totality” are profoundly problematized (“. . . there is no

 

‘totality’; . . . no evaluation of human existence, of human aims, can be made in regard to

 

something that does not exist . . .” [WM II. 169, WP 378] ), that Nietzsche almost never

 

speaks of the eternal return of the 

same, 

but simply of the eternal return—such massive details

 

are set aside. Nietzsche’s mockery of “making equal,” “mak-ing same” 

(Gleich) is 

ignored in

 

the energy of the Heideggerian copula that equates the will to power and the eternal return of

 

the 

same (Gleich) : 

“

Will to power is in essence and according to its inner possibility the

 

eternal return of the same.” (HN I. 

467)




Because Heidegger does not acknowledge the plurality of Nietzsche’s style, he does not allow

 

Nietzsche the privilege of being a philosopher of the “sous rature.” For him, Nietzsche

 

remains a metaphysician who asks the question of being, but does not question the

 

questioning itself! “Neither Nietzsche nor any thinker before him—also and exactly not

 

Hegel, who before Nietzsche for the first time thought the 

history 

of philosophy

 

philosophically—come to the commencing beginning, rather they see the beginning already

 

and only in the light of what is already a falling off from the beginning and a quietening of the

 

beginning: in the light of Platonic philosophy . . . Nietzsche himself already early on

 

designates his phi

losophy as reversed Platonism. The reversal does not eliminate the Platonic

 

premise, but rather solidifies it exactly through the appearance of elimi

nation.” 

(HN 

I. 469)

Within the encompassing and constricting frame of Nietzsche’s meta-physics 

“as the

 

metaphysics of subjectivity” (HN 

II. 199), Heidegger’s reading of Nietzsche is superb.

 

Unfortunately for my interests, and Der

rida’s, it matters more at this point that Heidegger

 

feels compelled to bypass or explain away so much in Nietzsche. I reserve the occasion for a

 

more thoroughgoing critique of the Heideggerian text on Nietzsche. Here let me indicate

 

some sweeping instances. If Nietzsche speaks of the world and of our sensations as chaos,

 

Heidegger explains chaos as 

“the exclusive [eigentümlich] blueprint of the world in totality

 

and its working. .. . 

‘Chaos’ cannot simply mean waste confusion, but the secrecy of the un-

subdued domain of becoming.” 

(HN I. 

566) Art (whose status in Nietzsche is extremely

 

elusive and problematic) 36 is then described as the supreme will to power, which, giving

 

form to chaos, (“another sign-chain

((xxxv))

telescoped there,” Nietzsche might mutter) is “the creative experience of’ becoming.” 

(HN 

I.

 

568) If Nietzsche invokes the body and the organism in general as limits to consciousness,

 

Heidegger brilliantly introduces the concept of “the bodying reason” and interprets

 

Nietzsche’s gesture as the extension of the concept of subjectivity to animality and the “

 

‘body’ .. . [as] the name for that form of the will to power in which the latter is immediately

 

accessible to man as the distinct ‘subject’.” 

(HN 

II. 300) When Nietzsche writes: “To impose

 

upon becoming the character of being —that is the supreme will to power” (WM II. loi, WP

 

330), Heidegger must read it without benefit of the pervasive irony of Nietzsche’s double

 

stance. He must even overlook the implications of the metaphor of im-printing 

(aufzuprägen)

 

that is translated as “to impose” in the English version. He must often in practice overlook the

 

fragmentary nature of 

The Will to Power, 

as he must overlook the interrogative form of many

 

of Nietzsche’s most aggressive insights. He must interpret the goal-lessness of the Over-man

 

as “the unconditioned mastery of man on earth. The man of this mastery is the Over-man.”

 

(HN 

II. 125)

Derrida thinks there might be profit in pushing through a rigorously Heideggerian reading of

 

Nietzsche—a reading that would develop into its ultimate coherence the Nietzsche who

 

actively forgets the terrible text of his own “knowledge.” At the limit such a reading would

 

break open, “its form re-cover its absolute strangeness, and his text finally invoke another

 

type of reading.”

Derrida’s own critique of Heidegger on Nietzsche—“La Question du style”—seems to move

 

around an apparently unimportant moment in the Heideggerian text. The strategy of

 

deconstruction, as we shall see later, often fastens upon such a small but tell-tale moment. In

 

this particular essay, the moment is Heidegger’s overlooking of the words “it 

becomes a

 




woman” 

in the chapter entitled “How the ‘True ‘World’ Ultimately Be-came a Fable: the

 

History of An Error,” in Nietzche’s 

The Twilight of the Idols. 37

Nietzsche’s brief chapter gives the history of Western metaphysics in six formulaic paragraphs

 

with accompanying “stage directions,” written in a peculiarly Nietzschean tone of jest in

 

earnest. At the moment when meta-physics changes from Platonism to Christianity, “the idea .

 

. . 

becomes a woman.” 

Heidegger takes no notice of this in his extended commentary on the

 

chapter. At that omission Derrida fixes his glance, and in a bold and most surprising gesture,

 

illuminates the “question of style” in Nietzsche through a discussion of the “question of

 

woman.”

A general reading of Nietzsche’s text would see him as a raging misogy

nist. But Derrida’s

 

careful reading disengages a more complex collection of attitudes toward woman. Derrida

 

breaks them into three and suggests

((xxxvi))

that each Nietzschean attitude is contiguous with a psychoanalytical “posi

tion”—a modality

 

of the subject’s relationship with the object. Sum

marized, the “positions” would be as

 

follows:

The woman . . . condemned as . . . figure or power of lying. . . . He was, he feared such a

 

castrated woman... .

The woman . . . condemned as . . . figure or power, of truth. . . . He was, he feared such a

 

castrating woman... .

The woman . . . recognized, beyond this double negation, affirmed as the affirmative,

 

dissimulating, artistic, Dionysiac. . . . He was, he loved such an affirmative woman. 

(QS 265,

 

267)

By means of an elaborate argument on the question of style, Derrida cautions us that these

 

three positions cannot be reconciled into a unity or even an “exhaustive code.” (QS 

266) 

But

 

if, that warning heeded, we were to concentrate here on the tripartite schema, and glance

 

again at the “History of An Error,” we might distill a Derridean reading of Nietzsche.

According to Nietzsche, with the coming of Christianity, the period of castration began, and

 

the idea, become a (castrating and castrated) woman, was pursued by the male type of the

 

philosopher for possession and appropriation. Nietzsche is caught up within this scheme,

 

speaks 

for 

men, proposes an 

Over-man. 

But his text is capable of pointing out that the woman

 

undermines the act of masculine possession by “giving herself” (in the sense of playing a part,

 

playing 

herself), even in the act of “giving her-self” up to sexual mastery.38 About this “truth

 

as woman,” one cannot then ask, “what is she?”—the ontological question—and expect an

 

answer—the hermeneutic assumption: “Each time that the question of the proper [of the self-

same, of appropriation, of knowledge as possession] emerges, .. . the onto-hermeneutic form

 

of interrogation shows its limit.” (QS 

274) 

In the very act of surrender, woman dissimulates.

 

Here we find a sexual description of that double register of knowledge-forgetfulness that

 

forever ruptures Nietzsche’s style. To possess the woman, one must 

be 

the woman (“the

 

contemplative character . . . consists of male mothers” 

[NW V. ii. 

196, 

GS 129] ), 

and yet the

 

being of the woman is unknown. The masculine style of possession through the stylus, the

 




stiletto, the spurs, breaks down as protection against the enigmatic femininity of truth.

 

“Perhaps truth is a woman who has reasons for not letting us see her reasons? Perhaps her

 

name is—to speak Greek—Baubo [female genitals]?” 

(NW V. ii. 20, 

GS 

38) 

“Even the

 

compassionate curiosity of the wisest student of humanity is inadequate for guessing how this

 

or that woman manages to accommodate herself to this solution of the [sexual] riddle . . . and

 

how the ultimate phi

losophy and skepsis of woman casts anchor at this point!” 

(NW V. ii. 

105,

 

GS 

128) Once we are put on the trail, the surprising passages appear, the text begins to open.

 

Man must constantly attempt to 

be 

the truth as

((xxxvii))

woman (articulate forgetfulness) in order to 

know 

her, which is im-possible. “Man and woman

 

change places, exchange their masks to infinity” (QS 

273). 

Is Derrida suggesting that, in

 

questioning a recoverable and possessable originary “truth,” Nietzsche is symbolically

 

questioning, as Freud did, the reality of a “primal scene,” of things in general being taken to

 

have begun with the castration of the phallus, with the distinct division into man and woman?

Is Nietzsche’s desire (as Derrida sees it) to place the castrating idea 

within 

history akin to

 

Freud’s rewriting of the primal “scene” into the child’s primal “fantasy?”39 Is the Nietzschean

 

text, in suggesting that in order to 

have 

(possess) the truth (woman) the philosopher must 

be

 

the truth (woman), undoing Freud’s incipient phallocentrism, which provides quite a different

 

alternative: if the son (man) disavows sexual difference, he seeks to 

be the phallus for 

the

 

mother (woman) and becomes “the lost object;” when the sexual difference is acknowledged,

 

the son (man) 

has 

the phallus through identification with the father. Is Nietzsche seeking to

 

undo that “repudiation of femininity” in the male—the other side of which is possession—that

 

Freud posits as “nothing else than a biological fact” (GW XVI. 99, SE XXIII. 

252), 

and

 

describe a femininity that is not defined by a male desire to supply a lack? 40

(Perhaps Derrida’s Nietzsche goes “beyond” Derrida’s Hegel. His con

sistent contraction for

 

the Hegelian 

savoir absolu 

[absolute knowledge] in 

Glas 

is Sa. Not only is this a misspelling

 

of “ça” [id, it], and the usual French contraction for “signifiant” [signifier], but also a

 

possessive pro-noun with a feminine object, which in this case is unnamed. Absolute

 

knowledge as articulated by Hegel might be caught within the will to an unnamed

 

[unnamable] “chose féminine” [female thing—in every sense].)

Derrida ends his essay with yet another long cautionary passage about the problem of reading

 

Nietzsche, 41 of the fact that in his text in particular, as we have tried to explain, one

 

consistent reading continually erases itself and invokes its opposite, and so on indefinitely:

 

“Do not conclude from this that one must give up immediately the knowledge of what 

it

 

means... . To be aware, as rigorously as possible, of that structural limit . . . one must push this

 

deciphering as far as possible. . . . If Nietzsche meant [wanted to say] something, would it not

 

be this limit of meaning [the will to say], as the effect of a will to power necessarily

 

differential, therefore always di

vided, folded, multiplied? . . . As much as to say that there

 

would no longer be a ‘totality of Nietzsche’s text,’ even fragmentary or aphoristic.” (QS 

285)

And, inaugurating for us an attitude that I shall develop later in this Preface, Derrida writes:

 

“The text can always remain at the same time open, proffered 

and 

indecipherable, even

 

without our knowing that it is indecipherable.” (QS 

286)

((xxxviii))




I should note here that Derrida always makes a ritual (and undoubtedly correct) gesture of

 

dismissal toward these fathers: “It was within concepts inherited from metaphysics that

 

Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger worked.” 

(ED 

413, SC 251) Heidegger came close to

 

undoing them, “destroying” them (Heidegger’s word), but gave in to them as well. Freud

 

nearly always believed that he worked within them. But Nietzsche cracked them apart and

 

then advocated forgetting that fact! Perhaps this entire argument hangs on who 

knew 

how

 

much of what he was doing. The will to knowl

edge is not easy to discard. When Derrida

 

claims for himself that he is within yet without the clôture of metaphysics, is the difference

 

not pre

cisely that he 

knows 

it at least? It is difficult to imagine a solution to the problem that

 

would go beyond Nietzsche’s: to know and then actively to forget, convincingly to offer in his

 

text his own misreading.

In 

Cartesian Meditations, 

Edmund Husserl differentiates between a “transcendental

 

phenomenology of consciousness” and a “pure psychology of consciousness,” the former a

 

study where “the psychic components of man . . . data belonging to the world . . . [are] not

 

accepted as actuality, but only as an actuality-phenomenon,” declaring them, however, an

 

“exact parallel.” Here is another distinction that a Nietzschean vision must undo.42 And for

 

Derrida, it is Freud who points toward a working of the psyche that “obliterates the

 

transcendental distinction between the origin of the world and Being-in-the-world. Obliterates

 

it while producing it.”43 Derrida does not look at psychoanalysis as a particular or “regional”

 

disci

pline, but a way of reading that unscrambles “the founding concept-words of ontology, of

 

being in its privilege” (35, 21). For his purposes, in other words, it is not a science that

 

necessarily provides a correct picture of the psychic norm and prescribes cures for the

 

abnormal, but rather teaches, through its own use thereof, a certain method of deciphering any

 

text.

Whether he acknowledges it or not, Freud implies that the psyche is a sign-structure “sous

 

rature,” for, like the sign, it is inhabited by a radical alterity, what is totally other—“Freud

 

gives it [this radical alterity] a meta-physical name, the unconscious” 

(MP 

21, SP 151) : “The

 

unconscious is the true psychical reality; 

in its innermost nature it is as much unknown to us

 

as the reality of the external world, and it is as incompletely presented by the data of

 

consciousness as is the external world by the communica

tions of our sense-organs.” (GW 

II–

III. 617–18, 

SE V. 

613) And, when he “substitutes” for “the antithesis between” “the

 

conscious and the uncon

scious” that between the ego and the id (the it, the other), the notion

 

of alterity remains undisturbed: “the id . . . is its [the ego’s] other external world 

[seine andere

 

Aussenwelt].” (GW 

XIII. 285, 

SE XIX. 

55) This alterity can never be made present as such to

 

the consciousness, which has

((xxxix))

dealings only with the preconscious, an area between itself and the un-conscious. “To

 

consciousness the whole sum of psychic processes presents itself as the realm of the

 

preconscious.” 

(GW X. 

290, 

SE 

XIV. 191) Yet “unconscious wishes always remain active....

 

Indeed it is a prominent feature of unconscious processes that they are indestructible.” (GW

 

II–III. 583, 

SE V. 

577)

Something that carries within itself the trace of a perennial alterity: the structure of the

 

psyche, the structure of the sign. To this structure Derrida gives the name “writing.” The sign

 




cannot be taken as a homogeneous unit bridging an origin (referent) and an end (meaning), as

 

“semiology,” the study of signs, would have it. The sign must be studied “under erasure,”

 

always already inhabited by the trace of another sign which never appears as such.

 

“Semiology” must give place to “grammatology.” As I have sug

gested, this move relates

 

closely to Nietzsche’s “genealogical” study of morals as unending “sign-chains.”

“

Writing,” then, is the name of the structure always already inhabited by the trace. This is a

 

broader concept than the empirical concept of writ-ing, which denotes an intelligible system

 

of notations on a material sub-stance. This broadening, Derrida feels, is accomplished by

 

Freud’s use of the metaphor of writing to describe both the content and the machinery of the

 

psyche. In an essay translated as “Freud and the Scene of Writing,” itself an example of the

 

rhetorical analysis of “philosophical” texts that Nietzsche spoke of, Derrida traces the

 

emergence of the metaphor of writing through three texts placed along a thirty-year span in

 

Freud’s career: “Project for A Scientific Psychology” (1895), 

The Interpretation of Dreams

 

(1899) and “A Note Upon the ‘Mystic Writing-Pad’ “ (1925). Through these three texts Freud

 

had grappled with the problem of finding a description for the content as well as the apparatus

 

of the psyche. With the 1925 “Note,” Freud arrives at last at a description of the psyche as a

 

“space of writing.” This is indeed not our empirical concept of writing, for here “script . . . is

 

never subject, extrinsic, and posterior to the spoken word.” 

(ED 

296, 

FF 

75) Nor is it simply a

 

metaphor for language. In the 

Interpretation, 

the dream-content—a paradigm of the entire

 

memory-work of the psyche—“is expressed . . . in a pictographic [not phonetic] script.” (GW

 

II–III. 283, 

SE 

IV. 277) In the “Note,” with its elaborate evocation of an actual writing toy, the

 

question of the place of speech simply does not arise: “I do not think it is too far-fetched to

 

compare the celluloid and waxed paper cover with the system 

Pcpt.–Cs. 

[perception-

conscious

ness] and its protective shield, the wax slab with the unconscious behind them, and

 

the appearance [becoming-visible; 

Sichtbarwerden] 

and dis-appearance of the writing with

 

the flickering-up and passing away of con

sciousness in the process of perception.” (GW XIV.

 

7, SE XIX. 230–31) In the last two chapters of the 

Interpretation, 

meditating in great detail

((xl))

upon “The Dream-Work” and “The Psychology of the Dream-Process,” Freud is compelled, at

 

the risk of some self-bafflement, to explode the idea of any unified agency for the psyche. By

 

the time Freud comes to write the “Note,” he has clearly established that the workings of the

 

psychic ap

paratus are themselves not accessible to the psyche. It is this apparatus that

 

“receives” the stimuli from the outside world. The psyche is “protected” from these stimuli.

 

What we think of as “perception” is always already an inscription. If the stimuli lead to

 

permanent “memory-traces”—marks which are 

not a 

part of conscious memory, and which

 

will constitute the play of the psyche far removed from the time of the reception of the stimuli

—there is no conscious perception. “The inexplicable phenomenon of consciousness arises

 

[periodically and irregularly] in the perceptual system instead of the permanent traces.” (GW

 

XIV. 4–5, 

SE XIX. 

228) There are periods, then, when the perceptual system is not activated

 

and that is pre

cisely when the lasting constitution of the psyche is being determined. It is only

 

the periods of its actual activation that gives us the sense of time. “Our abstract idea of time

 

seems to be wholly derived from the method of the working of the system 

Pcpt.–Cs. 

and to

 

correspond to a perception on its own part [self-perception; 

Selbstwahrnehmung] 

of that

 

method of work-ing.” (GW XIII. 

28, SE 

XVIII 28) In the “Note,” Freud undermines that

 

primary bastion of selfhood—the continuity of time-perception—both more boldly and more

 

tentatively; our sense of the continuity of time is a func

tion of the discontinuous periodicity of

 

the perceptual machine and, in-deed, a perception of nothing more than the working of that

 




machine: “this discontinuous method of functioning of the system Pcpt.–Cs. lies at the bottom

 

of the formation 

[Entstehung 

rather than 

origin—Ursprung] 

of the concept of time.” (G1V

 

XIV. 8, 

SE 

XIX. 231) Thus, within the Freudian thematics of the psyche, perception is an

 

“originary inscription.” And time, according to Kant the privileged and necessary “form of

 

intui

tion,” becomes a mark of “the economy of a writing” 

(ED 

334, 

FF 

112) on the mystic

 

writing pad of the psyche.

Nietzsche had undone the sovereign self by criticizing causality and substance. He had

 

indicated our ignorance of the minute particulars in

volved in a “single” human action. Freud

 

undoes the sovereign self by meditating upon those minute particulars.

Freud’s slow discovery of the metaphor of writing is so fascinating for Derrida because it does

 

not have the usual strings attached. In the section “The Signifier and Truth” of the

 

Gramrnatology, Derrida discusses one curious characteristic of the general usage of the

 

metaphor of writing: even as it is used, it is contrasted to writing in the literal sense. “Writing

 

in the common sense is the dead letter, it is the carrier of death [because it sig

nifies the

 

absence of the speaker]. . . . From another point of view, on the other face of the same

 

proposition, writing in the metaphoric sense, natural,

((xli))

divine, and living writing, is venerated; it is equal in dignity to the origin of value, to the

 

voice of conscience as divine law, to the heart, to sentiment and so forth.” (29, 17) Because

 

human beings need to comfort them-selves with notions of presence, writing in the “literal”

 

sense, signifying the absence of the actual author, must be “rejected,” even when it is

 

“accepted” as a metaphor. Freud’s use of the metaphor of writing is uncon

taminated by this

 

double dealing. In fact, Freud speculates that the very mansion of presence, the perceiving

 

self, is shaped by absence, and—writing.

The clôture of metaphysics found the origin and end of its study in presence. The questioners

 

of that enclosure—among them Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger—moved toward an articulation

 

of the need for the strategy of “sous rature.” Nietzsche puts “knowing” under erasure; Freud

 

“the psyche,” and Heidegger, explicitly, “Being.” As I have argued, the name of this gesture

 

effacing the presence of a thing and yet keeping it legible, in Derrida’s lexicon, is

 

“writing,”—the gesture that both frees us from and guards us within, the metaphysical

 

enclosure.

Freud does not put the psyche under erasure merely by declaring it to be inhabited by a radical

 

alterity; nor by declaring perception and temporality to be functions of a writing. He does it

 

also by his many avowed ques

tionings of that same topological fable of the mind that he

 

constantly uses. It does not seem correct to unproblematize Freud’s different models for the

 

psychic system and call them “varying ‘points of view’ used by Freud to represent the psychic

 

system.”

44

 The point is that Freud uses the dynamic (play of forces) or functional picture of

 

the psyche almost to annul the topological one; yet gives the topological picture greatest

 

usage; the typical sleight of hand of “sous rature.” Not only does he write that he will

 

“carefully avoid the temptation to determine psychical locality in any anatomical fashion”

 

(GW II—III. 

541, SE V. 536); 

but, he points out that, even within the “virtual” psychical

 

topography




an unconscious thought seeking to convey [translate] itself 

[nach Ubersetzung] 

into the

 

preconscious so as to be able to force its way through into con

sciousness . . . is not the

 

forming of a second thought situated in a new place, like a transcription that continues to exist

 

alongside the original; and the notion of forcing a way through into consciousness must be

 

kept carefully free from any idea of a change of locality. . . . What we are doing here is once

 

again to replace a topological way of representing things by a dynamic one. . . . Nevertheless,

 

I consider it expedient and justifiable to continue to make use of the figurative image of the

 

two systems. (GW II–III. 614–15, SE V. 6io–ii)

Some fifteen years later, writing on the Unconscious, Freud assures us: “Study of the

 

derivatives of the Ucs. will completely disappoint our expec

tations of a schematically clear-

cut distinction between the two psychical systems.” (GW X. 289, 

SE 

XIV. 190)

((xlii))

And yet the topographical fable continues to be used, to my mind pre

cisely because it is a

 

graphically representable one—a “structure” in that orthodox sense. Freud has dismantled the

 

sovereignty of the self; his topographical description allows him to suggest the production of

 

that self in the structuring of the text of the psyche. Derrida will say: “It is only necessary to

 

reconsider the problem of the effect of subjectivity as it is pro

duced by the structure of the

 

text.” (Pos F 122, Pos E 45)

“

I propose that when we have succeeded in describing a psychical process in its dynamic,

 

topographical and economic aspects,” Freud writes, “we should speak of it as 

a

 

metapsychological 

presentation.” (GW X. 281, 

SE 

XIV. 181) The notion of an “economic”

 

presentation of a mental process is pertinent to a reading of Derrida.

Economy is a metaphor of energy—where two opposed forces playing against each other

 

constitute the so-called identity of a phenomenon. In Freud’s “metapsychological

 

presentations,” the economic line of approach comes to modify the topographic and dynamic

 

ones, although, as I sug-gest above, the other descriptions are never given up. “The ultimate

 

things which psychological research can learn about [are] the behavior of the two primal

 

instincts, their distribution, mingling and defusion—things which we cannot think of as being

 

confined to a single province of the mental apparatus, the id, the ego or the super-ego. . . .

 

Only by the con-current or mutually opposing action”—in other words, economy—“of the

 

two primal instincts—Eros and the death-instinct—, never by one or the other alone, can we

 

explain the rich multiplicity [many-coloredness; 

Buntheit] 

of the phenomena [appearances,

 

Erscheinungen] 

of life.” (GW XVI. 88–89, 

SE 

XXIII, 242–43)

Economy is not a reconciliation of opposites, but rather a maintaining of disjunction. Identity

 

constituted by difference is economy. In Freud’s world, a train of thought is sustained by its

 

opposite, a unit of meaning contains the possibility of its opposite: “Each train of thought is

 

almost invariably accompanied by its contradictory counterpart, linked with it by antithetical

 

association.” (GW II–III, 316, 

SE 

IV. 312) Normality—an “ideal fiction” (GW XVI. 8o, 

SE

 

XXIII, 235)—and neurosis are ac-complices: “Psycho-analytic research finds no fundamental,

 

but only quantitative, distinctions between normal and neurotic life. . . . We must recognize

 

that the psychical mechanism employed by neuroses is not created by the impact of a

 

pathological disturbance upon the mind, but is present already in the normal structure of the

 

mental apparatus.” (GW II–III. 378, 613; 

SE 

V. 373, 607) Following a similar strategy, Freud

 

will argue, after carefully developing a contrast between the pleasure principle and the death

 




instinct: “The pleasure principle seems actually to serve the death instincts.” (GW XIII. 69,

 

SE 

XVIII. 63) The exposition of the death instinct itself is made in terms of a bold economy

 

of life and inertia:

((xliii))

“

The inertia inherent in organic life.” (GW XIII. 38, 

SE 

XVIII. 36) We are not surprised when

 

Freud proposes an economy of the body and the mind: “. . . the activity of thinking is also

 

supplied from the sublimation of erotic motive forces.” (GW XIII. 274, 

SE 

XIX. 45) Not only

 

are we within the ambiance of that undoing-preserving of opposites that Derrida finds

 

congenial also in Nietzsche; this last passage in fact advances what Nietzsche calls the “new

 

psychology” as he points at the need for com

bining “philology” (the genealogy of language)

 

and “physiology” (the field of the erotic).

I have cited above the Freudian argument that the establishment of permanent traces in the

 

psychic apparatus precludes the possibility of immediate perception. Relating this delaying

 

mechanism to the economy of opposites, Derrida writes: “Following a schema that

 

continually guides Freud’s thinking, the movement of the trace is described as an effort of life

 

to protect itself 

by deferring 

the dangerous investment, by consti

tuting a reserve 

(Vorrat). 

And

 

all the conceptual oppositions that furrow Freudian thought relate each concept to the other

 

like movements of a detour, within the economy of differance. The one is only the other

 

deferred, the one differing from the other.” (MP 19-20, SP 150)

This passage is taken from the essay “La différance.” It emphasizes the presence of Freud in

 

the articulation of what comes close to becoming Derrida’s master-concept—“differance”

 

spelled with an “a.” Let us fasten on three moments in the quotation—“differing,”

 

“deferring,” and “detour.” I have spoken of the radically other, which is always different,

 

nonidentical. Add to this the structure of the perennial postponement of that which is

 

constituted only through postponement. The two together—“difference” and “deferment”—

both senses present in the French verb “différer,” and both “properties” of the sign under

 

erasure—Derrida calls “différance.” This differance—being the structure (a structure never

 

quite there, never by us perceived, itself deferred and different) of our psyche—is also the

 

structure of “presence,” a term itself under erasure. For differance, pro

ducing the differential

 

structure of our hold on “presence,” never produces presence as such.

The structure of “presence” is thus constituted by difference and de-ferment. But since the

 

“subject” that “perceives” presence is also consti

tuted similarly, differance is neither active

 

nor passive. The “-ance” ending is the mark, of that suspended status. Since the difference

 

between “dif

ference” and “differance” is inaudible, this “neographism” reminds us of the

 

importance of writing as a structure. The “a” serves to remind us that, even within the graphic

 

structure, the perfectly spelled word is always absent, constituted through an endless series of

 

spelling mistakes.

In “La différance,” Derrida relates the thought of differance to Nietzsche, Freud, and

 

Heidegger. But he seems most moved by the Freudian break-

((xliv))

through. The disjunction between perception and the permanent trace seems to make thought

 

itself a differance of perception. The complicity between the organism and the inertia of the

 




inorganic state makes life a differance of death 

(ED 333 

n., 

FF 

112 n.). Through these

 

Freudian in-sights, and Freud’s notion that our perception of unconscious traces occur long

 

“after the event,” Derrida consolidates what he had spotted in Hus

serl’s structuring of the

 

Living Present in his Introduction to 

The Origin of Geometry: 

“the pure consciousness of

 

delay.” (p. 171)

Derrida quotes from 

Beyond the Pleasure Principle: “

Under the influ

ence of the ego’s

 

instincts of self-preservation, the pleasure principle is replaced by the reality principle. This

 

latter principle does not abandon the intention of ultimately obtaining pleasure, but it

 

nevertheless demands and carries into effect the postponement of satisfaction, the

 

abandonment of a number of possibilities of gaining satisfaction and the temporary toleration

 

of unpleasure as a step on the long indirect road 

(Aufschub) 

to pleasure.” Within Freud’s

 

discourse, Derrida relates this postponement (deferment) and “the relation to the absolutely

 

other [differance] that apparently breaks up any economy” by arguing as follows:

The economic character of differance in no way implies that the deferred pres

ence can always

 

be recovered, that it simply amounts to an investment that only temporarily and without loss

 

delays the presentation of presence. . . . The un-conscious is not . . . a hidden, virtual, and

 

potential self-presence. . . . There is no chance that the mandating subject “exists” somewhere,

 

that it is present or is “itself,” and still less chance that it will become conscious.... This

 

radical alterity, removed from every possible mode of presence, is characterized by .. .

 

delayed effects. In order to describe them, in order to read the traces of the “unconscious”

 

traces (There are no “conscious” traces [since the traces are marked precisely when there is no

 

conscious perception]), the language of pres

ence or absence, the metaphysical speech of

 

phenomenology, is in principle inadequate. (MP 21. SP 152)

Here I must repeat, with modifications, a question that I broached at the end of our discussion

 

of Nietzsche, and perhaps attempt a partial answer to it: the question of mastery through

 

knowledge in Derrida. Nietzsche had discovered the need to sustain disjunction, to love fate,

 

cultivate 

amor fati. 

But his entire idiom of thought and action was to place the responsibility

 

upon a self whose existence he argued against. His text became the violent and deliberate

 

playground of differance. Freud allowed Derrida to think that the philosophic move did not

 

necessarily require a Nietzschean vio

lence. Simply to recognize that one is shaped by

 

differance, to recognize that the “self” is constituted by its never-fully-to-be-recognized-ness,

 

is enough. We do not have to cultivate forgetfulness or the love of chance; we 

are 

the play of

 

chance and necessity. There is no harm in the will to knowledge; for the will to ignorance

 

plays with it to constitute it—if we

((xlv))

long to know we obviously long also to be duped, since knowledge is duping. Nietzsche on

 

the other hand saw the 

“active 

forgetfulness of the question of being” as a gigantic ebullience.

 

Perhaps it is after all a difference in meta

phorical nuance. Derrida’s understanding of such a

 

forgetfulness—via Freud’s research into memory—is that it is active in the shaping of our

 

“selves” in spite of “ourselves.” We are surrendered to its inscription. Per

haps, as I have

 

argued, in the long run what sets “Derrida” apart is that he 

knows 

that he is always already

 

surrendered to writing as he writes. His knowledge is, after all, his power. Nietzsche,

 

paradoxically, 

knew 

even this, so that his affirmative and active (knowing) forgetfulness was a

 

move against the inevitability of a knowledge symptomatically priding itself on remembering.

 

It is curious that, speaking to Jean-Louis Houdebine about his strategy in an interview,

 




Derrida remarks again and again, “But I knew what I was doing.”45 The will to power is not

 

so easy to elude. It is also curious that, although Derrida speaks often of Nietzsche’s explosive

 

and affirmative and open play, he speaks rarely of Freud’s own analysis of play as a restrictive

 

gesture of power—most significantly in Freud’s com

ments on the child’s game of 

“fort-da,”

 

where the very economy of ab

sence and presence is brought under control. 

(GW 

XIII. 11-15,

 

SE 

XVIII. 14–17)

Yet, if we respect Derrida’s discourse, we cannot catch him out so easily. What does it show

 

but that he is after all caught and held by the metaphysical enclosure even as he questions it,

 

that his text, as all others, is open to an interpretation that he has done a great deal to describe?

 

He does not succeed in applying his own theory perfectly, for the successful application is

 

forever deferred. Differance/writing/trace as a structure is no less than a prudent articulation

 

of the Nietzschean play of knowledge and forgetfulness.

(After this writing, I heard Derrida’s as yet unpublished lectures on Francis Ponge and

 

Heidegger, delivered at Yale in the fall of 1975. He himself opens the question of differance

 

and mastery there as the question of the desire of deconstruction. I present his argument

 

briefly at the end of Section IV.)

Derrida receives from Freud an actual method of deciphering in the narrow sense as well. One

 

important distinction between the Heideggerean method of “destruction” (see page xlviii), and

 

Derrida’s “de-construction” is the latter’s attention to the minute detailing of a text, not only

 

to the syntax but to the shapes of the words in it. Derrida is fascinated by Freud’s notion that

 

dreams may treat “words” as “things.” The analytical method used in Part II of the

 

Grammatology 

remains conservative from this point of view, and generally honors the outline

 

of the word as such. Starting with

((xlvi))

La dissémination, 

however, Derrida begins to notice the play of revelation and concealment

 

lodged within 

parts 

of individual words. The tendency becomes pervasive in 

Glas, 

where the

 

individual phonemes/graphemes constituting words are often evoked out into an independent

 

dance. Der-rida pushes through to an extreme Freud’s own method of attending to the

 

“syntax” of a dream text. I give below Freud’s skeletal summary of the rich and complex

 

method.

In 

The Interpretation of Dreams, 

he lists the four techniques employed by the dream-work of

 

the psychic apparatus to distort or “refract” the dream-thought (psychic content) to produce

 

the pictographic script of the dream: condensation, displacement, considerations of

 

representability, and secondary revision. “Condensation” and-»displacement” may be rhe

-

torically translated as metaphor and metonymy.46 The third item on the list points at the

 

technique which distorts an idea so that it can be presented as an image. Freud’s description of

 

the fourth item recalls Nietzsche’s words on the will to power seeking to preserve unification,

 

as well as Derrida’s description of the text in general: “A dream is a conglomerate which, for

 

purposes of investigation, must be broken up once more into fragments. ... A psychical force

 

is at work [is displayed, 

äussert] 

in dreams which creates this apparent connectedness, which

 

. . . submits the material pro

duced by the dream-work to a ‘secondary revision.’ “ (GW II–III.

 

451–52, 

SE V. 

449) I reopen the question of Freud and textuality on page Ixxvi.




This notion that the verbal text is constituted by concealment as much as revelation, that the

 

concealment is itself a revelation and vice versa, brings Nietzsche and Freud together. Freud

 

suggests further that where the subject is 

not 

in control of the text, where the text looks super-

smooth or superclumsy, is where the reader should fix his gaze, so that he does not merely

 

read but deciphers the text, and sees its play within the open textuality of thought, language,

 

and so forth within which it has only a provisionally closed outline. He catches this notion

 

thus: “There is often a passage in even the most thoroughly interpreted dream which has to be

 

left obscure. . . . At that point there is a tangle of dream-thoughts which cannot be unravelled

 

and which moreover adds nothing to our knowledge of the content of the dream.” Derrida’s

 

“advance” on Freud here can be formulated thus: this tangle cannot be unravelled in terms of,

 

and adds nothing to the contents of the dream-text within the limits set up by itself. If,

 

however, we have nothing vested in the putative identity of the text or dream, that passage is

 

where we can provisionally locate the text’s moment of transgressing the laws it apparently

 

sets up for itself, and thus unravel—deconstruct—the very text. This illuminates the lines in

 

Freud that follow the passage above: “This is the dream’s navel, the spot where it reaches

 

down into the unknown. The dream-thoughts .. . cannot . . . have any definite endings: they

 

are bound to branch out in

((xlvii))

every direction into the intricate network of our world of thought.” 

(GW 

II–III. 530, 

SE V.

 

525)

It is difficult to bring out the close yet necessarily oblique relationship between Freud’s and

 

Derrida’s methods of textual interpretation without going into extreme detail. However, as

 

Derrida himself remarks, 

Of Gram

matology 

and his earlier texts merely inaugurate the

 

participation in a specifically Freudian intertextuality. The erotic investment of writing in

 

children holds his interest in a long footnote on page 132 (333). The elaboration of the

 

thematics of masturbation and writing, of the mark of supplementarity in the chain of mother-

substitutions, as Derrida locates them in Rousseau’s text, are psychoanalytical only in a very

 

general sense. It should of course be abundantly clear that, even on so general a plane, Derrida

 

would not use a psychoanalytical method to conduct us to “a psycho-biographical signified

 

whose link with the literary signifier then becomes perfectly extrinsic and contingent” (228–

29, 159). In fact, al-ready in this early work, Derrida urges the importance, for grammatology,

 

of a psychoanalysis that has freed itself from an attitude that sees all tex

tuality as a

 

dispensable source of substantive evidence. The use of the sexual structures of psychoanalysis

 

as a tool of interpretation becomes steadily more marked in Derrida’s later work. The essay on

 

Nietzsche, comment-ing on “the question of style” as the “question of woman” is an example.

 

And Derrida–Freud comes most disturbingly into his own in 

Glas. I 

shall deal with Derrida’s

 

modification of the theme of castration in connection with his reading of Jacques Lacan.

Derrida cautions us in a long headnote to “Freud and the Scene of Writing” that, the

 

institution of grammatology through the recognition of systematic “repression” of writing

 

throughout the history of the West cannot be taken as a psychoanalytic endeavor on a

 

macrocosmic scale. For Freud’s need to describe the coexistence of the (at least) double text

 

of the psyche in terms of latent and manifest contents, or, indeed, repression and sublimation,

 

is itself caught within that suspect terminology of binary oppo

sitions; and further, the very

 

pattern of repression in an individual can only be possible because of his need to reject all that

 

is recognized to be inhabited by the structure of writing: castration (the loss of mastery),

 

penis-envy (the fear of absence). I shall later present Derrida’s counter

arguments—




dissemination and the hymen. Yet Freud cannot be dismissed out of hand. Did he perhaps

 

himself sense this need to reject writing? Derrida ends “Freud and the Scene of Writing” with

 

this quotation from Freud’s “Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety”: “As soon as writing, which

 

entails making a liquid flow out of a tube on to a piece of white paper, assumes the

 

significance of copulation, or as soon as walking becomes a symbolic substitute for treading

 

upon the body of mother earth, both writing and walking are stopped because they represent

 

the performance of

((xlviii))

a forbidden sexual act.” (GW XIV. 116, SE XX. 90) Meanwhile, the word against Freud

 

remains: “Necessity for an immense work of decon

struction of these concepts and the

 

metaphysical phrases that condense and sediment there.” 

(ED 

294) This can indeed be the

 

ever-sustained word against all gestures of surrender to precursors: As you follow, also

 

deconstruct, for, as you deconstruct, you must follow.

I maintain . . . that Heidegger’s text is of extreme importance, that it con

stitutes an

 

unprecedented, irreversible advance and that we are still very far from having exploited all its

 

critical resources. . . . [Yet there are] propositions whose disorder has . . . disconcerted me. To

 

cite one example, ‘Derridian grammatics are “modeled,” in their broad outlines, on

 

Heideggerian metaphors, which they attempt to “deconstruct” by substituting for the

 

“presence of the logos” the anteriority of a trace; his grammatics become onto-theology

 

relying upon the trace as their “basis,” “foundation” or “origin.” ‘ (Pos F 73, 

70, Pos 

EI 40,

 

39–40)

Taking issue against Elisabeth Roudinesco, whom he quotes above, Derrida states his

 

relationship to Heidegger and warns against false descriptions of it. I have already considered

 

his involvement in and rewriting of the Heideggerian “sous rature,” and his use of Heidegger

 

as a perspective on Nietzsche. Now I glance briefly at another aspect of Derrida’s rewriting of

 

Heidegger: the method of deconstruction as practised by Heideggerian metaphysics.

What Derrida balks at in Roudinesco’s description is that a “gram

matology”—science of the

 

effacement of the trace—should be described as modeled on a “metaphysics”—science of

 

presence; that it should be called an “onto-theology”—science of Being and of God as

 

regulative presences, that the “trace,” mark of radical anteriority, should be misnamed an

 

“origin.” We shall note and avoid these errors; and go on to say, as does Derrida of

 

“differance”: “By establishing this relation between a re

stricted [Heideggerian metaphysics]

 

and a general system [grammatology],” Derrida “shifts and recommences the very project of

 

philosophy.” (MP 21, 

SP 

151)

Heidegger already points toward the relationship between his own, and the grammatological

 

methods, by ignoring, in his practice of reading, the absolute authority of the text. When

 

Heidegger “reads” Hegel, or Kant, or Nietzsche, in the long run he “examine[s] not what [the

 

author] says but” —note the passive construction, the withdrawal of authority from the

 

sovereign author—“what is achieved.” 

(KPM G 

193, 

KPM 

E 221) He thinks of his own task

 

as a “loosening up” of the “hardened tradition” of “ontology” by a “

positive 

destruction,”47 a

 

“destructive retrospect of the history of ontology” which “lays bare the internal character or

 

develop-




((xlix))

ment” of a text. 

(KPM 

G 194, 

KPM 

E 222) (It is interesting to note that, in the first published

 

version of 

De la grammatologie, 

Derrida uses the word “destruction” in place of

 

“deconstruction.”) Describing Derrida’s own procedure, Paul de Man gives us something very

 

close to these Heideggerian passages: “His text, as he puts it so well, is the unmaking of a

 

construct. However negative it may sound, deconstruction implies the possibility of

 

rebuilding.”48 Because the author fancies himself sovereign, there is a point, Heidegger

 

suggests, where his own conception of the text blinds him: “Descartes had to neglect the

 

question of Being altogether”; “the doctrine of the schematism . . . had to remain closed off to

 

Kant.”49 Like the analyst moving with his patient in the seesaw of a “transference-

relationship,” the deconstructing critic must “free and . . . safeguard” the intrinsic powers “of

 

a problem.” ( 

KPM G 

185, 

KPM 

E 211) In Derrida’s words :

Reading must always aim at a certain relationship, unperceived by the writer, between what

 

he commands and what he does not command of the schemata of the language that he uses.

 

This relationship is not a certain quantitative dis

tribution of shadow and light, of weakness

 

and force, but a signifying structure that critical reading must 

produce. . . . 

[Without] all the

 

instruments of tra

ditional criticism, . . . critical production would risk developing in any

 

direction and authorize itself to say almost anything. But this indispensable guard-rail has

 

always only 

protected, 

never 

opened, a 

reading (227, 158) .

To take apart, to produce a reading, to open the textuality of a text. Der-rida shares these

 

procedural guidelines with Heidegger. Freud has helped to push the procedure further—given

 

him some means of locating the text’s “navel,” as it were, the moment that is undecidable in

 

terms of the text’s apparent system of meaning, the moment in the text that seems to

 

transgress its own system of values. The desire for unity and order com

pels the author and the

 

reader to balance the equation that is the text’s system. The deconstructive reader exposes the

 

grammatological structure of the text, that its “origin” and its “end” are given over to

 

language in general (what Freud would call “the unknown world of thought”), by locating the

 

moment in the text which harbors the unbalancing of the equation, the sleight of hand at the

 

limit of a text which cannot be dis-missed simply as a contradiction. In the 

Grammatology’s

 

reading of Rous-seau, this “moment” is the double-edged word “supplement.” In 

La

 

pharmacie de Platon, 

it is the double-edged word 

“pharmakon” 

as well as the absence of the

 

word 

“pharmakos.” 

In Derrida’s brief reading of Aristotle’s 

Physics 

IV, it is the unemphatic

 

word 

“ama,” 

carrying the burden of differance. 

(Dis 

69-197, 

MP 

31–78)

One important difference between Heidegger and Derrida lies in their concepts of time.

 

Through a delicate analysis that I shall not attempt to re-

((l))

produce here, Derrida demonstrates that, although Heidegger would purge Kant and Hegel—

indeed what Heidegger sees as the entire Aristotelian tra

dition—of “the vulgar concept of

 

time”—there can be no concept of time that is not caught within the metaphysical clôture:

 

“wishing to produce that 

other 

concept, one quickly sees that it would be constructed with

 

other metaphysical or onto-theological predicates.” (MP 73) 50 Heidegger catches a glimpse

 

of this through his crossing-out of “Being.” At the stage of 

Sein and Zeit, 

however, Heidegger

 

still thinks of “time” as that which “

needs to be explicated originarily 

[einer ursprünglichen

 

Explikation] 

as the horizon for the understanding of Being.”

51 Time is still the model of pure

 




auto-affection, where something ideal—Being 

as such—is 

produced without having to relate

 

to an object. (Derrida puts auto-affection in ques

tion and suggests that it always already

 

carries an irreducible element of hetero-affection, desiring and relating to an alterity, which in

 

this case is the 

question 

of Being—or Being under erasure.) For the earlier Heidegger, then,

 

the “question of Being,” as Derrida points out in “Ousia et grammè,” seem interchangeable.

 

By the time of 

Der Spruch des Anaximander,52 

Heidegger himself sees Being as

 

precomprehended and nonsignifiable, and the 

presence 

seemingly signified in a text is seen as

 

the only means for language to point at the effaced 

trace 

(MP 76–77) . Heidegger has by then

 

arrived at the crossing-out of being, and does not find the meaning of being in temporality.

 

But time itself seems more effectively crossed out for Der-rida through the Freudian

 

suggestion that time is the discontinuous per

ception of the psychic machinery.

Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger. All three concerned with a problem that Heidegger would

 

articulate thus: 

“More originary 

[ursprünglich] 

than man is the finitude of the 

Dasein 

in him.”

 

(KPM 

G 207, 

KPM 

E 237) All three proto-grammatologues. Nietzsche a philosopher who cut

 

away the grounds of knowing. Freud a psychologist who put the psyche in question. Heideg

-

ger an ontologist who put Being under erasure. It was for Derrida to “pro-duce” their intrinsic

 

power and “discover” grammatology, the science of the “sous rature.” That sleight of hand is

 

contained in the name itself, “the logos of the grammè.” The grammè is the written mark, the

 

name of the sign “sous rature.” “Logos” is at one extreme “law” and at the other “phonè”—

the voice. As we have seen, the grammè would question the authority of the law, deconstruct

 

the privilege of the spoken word. The word “Grammatology” thus appropriately 

keeps alive

 

an unresolved con

tradiction. Derrida sets forth the meaning of this contradiction in the sec

tion

 

of our book entitled “Of Grammatology as A Positive Science.” And the texts of Nietzsche,

 

Freud, and Heidegger are this contradiction’s pre-text.

((li))

(The importance of the text of Edmund Husserl for Derrida lies precisely in its self-conflict.

 

Husserl seems to Derrida to be a more than usually reso

lute suppressor of the more than

 

usually astute grammatological suggestions implied by the Husserlian text.)

It is of course futile to trace the origin of a particular thought: “We know that the metaphor

 

that would describe the genealogy of a text correctly is still 

forbidden” 

(

i

Ø, 101). Yet one

 

might wonder if the thought of “writing” in Derrida is not a sort of answer to the question of

 

“geometry” in Husserl. As I have mentioned, Derrida’s first book is a translation of and

 

introduction to Husserl’s “Origin of Geometry.” The question asked by Husserl is precisely a

 

question of the relationship between subjective and objective structures. How can the forms of

 

an absolutely ideal objectivity—the essence of geometry (not actual systems of geometry)

 

arise within the ,structures of the subject? At the end of his long introduction, Derrida sug

-

gests that Husserl’s answer, if “produced” fully, would be that the possi

bility of objectivity is

 

lodged within the subject’s self-presence. The transcendental subject’s ideal object is itself. In

 

its contemplation of itself the self cannot remain within the “simple now-ness of a Living

 

Present,” it must give itself a history, differentiate itself from itself through a backward glance

 

which also makes possible a forward glance: “An originary con

sciousness of delay can only

 

have the pure form of anticipation.... With-out this [consciousness] ... discourse and history

 

[and Geometry as the possibility of history] would not be possible.”




Through these notions of self-differentiation and self-postponement, Husserl seems to be

 

launching the idea of differance: “The originary Dif

ferance of the absolute Origin . . . is

 

perhaps 

what has always been said through the concept of the ‘

transcendental.’ . . . 

This

 

strange procession of a ‘Rückfrage’ [checking back], is the movement 

sketched 

in ‘The Origin

 

of Geometry.’ 53 The idea is 

perhaps 

there in Husserl, and if so, it is only 

sketched. 

For, as we

 

shall see later in my discussion of phonocentrism, Husserl surrounds this idea of differance

 

with a constituting subject, a subject that generates and is therefore the absolute origin of the

 

structure of difference. To win Husserl’s thought, which unwillingly outlines the structures of

 

grammatology, into grammatological discourse, a massive rewriting will have to be

 

undertaken: “This determination of ‘absolute sub

jectivity’ would . . . have to be crossed out as

 

soon as we conceive the present

on the basis of differance, and not the reverse. The concept of 

subjectivity 

((11))

belongs 

a priori 

and 

in general 

to the order of the 

constituted 

[rather than ;r the

 

constituting].... There is no constituting subjectivity. The very con

cept of constitution itself

 

must be deconstructed.” (VP 94 n., SP 84–85 n.)

Not only in the field of subjectivity, but also in the field of objective knowledge, Husserl

 

seems to open as well as deliberately close the possi

bility of grammatology. If there is an

 

“indeterminately general presumptive

((lii))

horizon” of the knowable, Husserl places it within the control of an in-finitely synthesising

 

directedness (intentionality) of the ego, an ego that can be uncovered for the philosopher only

 

by bracketing, “ ‘putting out of play’ of all positions taken toward the already-given Objective

 

world.”

54

 If, almost in spite of himself, Husserl seems to suggest that expression can never be

 

adequate to the sense which it expresses, he covers himself by giving to the “is” or to the

 

predicative statement a privilege. Once again, Derrida must undertake a reversal. “It might

 

then be thought [following Husserl] that the 

sense of being 

has been limited by the imposition

 

of form—which ... would, with the authority of the is, have assigned to the sense of being the

 

closure of presence, the form-of-presence, presence-in-form, or form-presence.... [or] that

 

[the] thought of form 

[pensée de la forme] 

has the power to extend itself beyond the thought

 

of being 

[pensée de l’être]... . 

Our task is . . . to reflect on the circularity which makes the one

 

pass into the other indefinitely.” (MP 206-07, SP 127–28)

Freud had found in the mystic writing pad a model that would con-tain the problematics of the

 

psyche—a virgin surface that still retained permanent traces. Husserl confronted a similar

 

problem when he posited a “sense” that is anterior to the act of “expression” or “meaning.”

 

“How could we ever conceive,” Derrida asks, “of the perpetual restoration of meaning in its

 

virginal state [within the egological history]?” (MP 197, SP 118) Husserl does not stop to

 

consider the question. He simply “betrays a certain uneasiness ... and attributes the

 

indecisiveness of his description to the incidentally metaphorical character of language.” (MP

 

198, SP 119) Again it is Derrida who, through a careful consideration of precisely the

 

metaphorics of Husserl’s argument, must deliver the conclusion: “We must conclude that

 

sense in general, the noematic [knowable] sense of every experience, is something which, by

 

its very nature, must be already able to 

be impressed 

on a meaning, to leave or receive its

 




formal determination in a meaning. Sense would therefore already be a kind of blank and

 

mute writing which is reduplicated in meaning.” (MP 197, SP 117)

One of Husserl’s most original insights is that speech can be genuine without “knowledge,”

 

that the relation with the object that “animates the body of the signifier” need not be “known”

 

by the speaker or hearer , through direct intuition. Derrida, “following the logic and necessity

 

of these [Husserl’s] distinctions” (VP 102, SP 92), disengages a more radical suggestion :

.... not only [does] meaning . . . . not essentially imply the intuition of the object but ... it

 

essentially excludes it. . . . My nonperception, my nonintuition, 

my hic et nunc 

absence are

 

said by that very thing that I say, 

by that 

which I say and 

because 

I say it.... The absence of

 

intuition—and therefore of the subject of the intuition—is not only 

tolerated 

by speech; 

it is

 

required by 

the general structure of signification, when considered 

in itself. It is 

radically

((liii))

requisite: the total absence of the subject and object of a statement—the death of the writer

 

and/or the disappearance of the object he was able to describe—does not prevent a text from

 

“meaning” something. On the contrary, this possibility gives birth to meaning as such, gives it

 

out to be heard and read. (VP 102, 108; SP 92–93)

The structure of alterity (otherness and absence of meaning or self) must be operative within

 

the sign for it to operate as 

such. 

But Husserl cannot fully articulate this trace-structure of

 

expression, which his text suggests: “The theme of full ‘presence,’ the intuitionistic

 

imperative [expression must be fulfilled through intuition], and the project of knowledge

 

continue to command—at a distance, we said—the whole of the description. Husserl

 

describes, and in one and the same movement effaces, the emancipation of speech as

 

nonknowing.” (VP 109, SP 97)

The intuitionistic imperative works curiously in the case of the word “I.” Husserl will not

 

grant it the possibility of being uttered without being known intuitively.

Husserl

’s premises should sanction our saying exactly the contrary. 

Just as I need not perceive

 

in order to understand a statement about perception, so there is no need to inuit the object I in

 

order to understand the word I... . Whether or not perception accompanies the statement of

 

perception, whether or not life as self-presence accompanies the uttering of the I, is quite

 

indifferent with regard to the functioning of meaning. My death is structurally necessary to

 

the pronouncing of the I. . . . The anonymity of the written I, the im-propriety [lack of

 

property] of 

I write, is, 

contrary to what Husserl says, the “normal situation.” (VP 107–08, 

SP

 

96-97)

Thus Derrida “produces” an ostensibly most anti-Husserlian reading of Husserl: for Husserl,

 

as we have seen, the voice—not empirical speech but the phenomenological structure of the

 

voice—is the most immediate evi

dence of self-presence. In that silent interior monologue,

 

where no alien material signifier need be introduced, pure self-communication (auto-

affection) is possible. Derrida shows that, if Husserlian theory is followed rigorously, a

 

procedure Husserl himself seems unwilling to undertake, the structure of speech or voice is

 

seen to be constituted by the necessary ab

sence of both the object and the subject. It is

 

constituted, in other words, by the structure of writing: “The autonomy of meaning with

 

regard to intuitive cognition . . . [that] Husserl established . . . has its norm in writ-ing.” (VP

 




108, SP 96-97) (Derrida will argue, on p. 6o passim 

(40) 

of the 

Grammatology, 

that Saussure

 

too is unable to accept non-intuition as a norm, but must see it as “crisis.”)

Such is Derrida’s intimate play with Husserl’s text: always to produce the counter-reading out

 

of the latter’s protective hedging. Perhaps all texts are at least double, containing within

 

themselves the seeds of their own de-

((liv))

struction. In Husserl’s case, the doubleness shows itself in an extraordinary transparency. “An

 

underlying motif . . . disturb[s] and contest[s] the se

curity of . . . [the] traditional distinctions

 

[made in Husserl’s text] 

from within.” (VP 92, SP 82; 

italics mine) (Although he had not

 

made a theme of ... the work of difference in the constitution of sense and signs, he 

at bottom

 

recognized its necessity.” (VP 114, SP roi; italics mine) No doubt the effort at helping

 

Husserl’s discourse dehisce sharpened Derrida’s thoughts of grammatology. But the

 

relationship between the two is in-terminably interpretive and has no place in a preface.

 

Speech and Phe

nomena, 

Derrida’s study of Husserl, is thus a philosophical companion-text to

 

the study of Rousseau in Part II of the 

Grammatology.)

Hegel’s shadow upon Derrida is diffuse and gigantic. We shall lose sight of the provisional

 

outlines of the book 

Grammatology 

if we pursue indefi

nitely the remoter ancestors of the

 

common noun “grammatology.” Derrida’s discussion of Hegel, “the first philosopher of

 

writing,” in the 

Grammatology 

and “Le puits et la pyramide: introduction à la sémiologie de

 

Hegel” (MP 

79.-127) 

is explicit and clear. It prepares us for the joyous and magnificent

 

unstitching of some Hegelian texts in 

Glas. 

It is an inti

mate intertextuality to which I direct

 

your attention, and there make an end. I shall speak of Hegel a little toward the end of this

 

Preface.

Let it finally be said that, within this framework, counting the proper names of predecessors

 

must be recognized as a convenient fiction. Each proper name establishes a sovereign self

 

against the anonymity of tex

tuality. Each proper name pretends that it is the origin and end of

 

a cer

tain collocation of thoughts that may be unified: “The names of authors or of doctrines

 

have here no substantial value. They indicate neither identi

ties nor causes. It would be

 

frivolous to think that ‘Descartes,’ ‘Leibniz,’ ‘Rousseau,’ etc. are names of authors, of the

 

authors of movements or dis-placements that we thus designate. The indicative value that I

 

attribute to them is first the name of a problem” 

(147–48 

99). Proper names are no more than

 

serviceable “metonymic contractions.”

III

“

Structuralism” is the name of the problematics that we recognize most readily on the

 

European scene of the sixties. What is Derrida’s relationship to structuralism?

Definitions of movements of thought are always contingent and pro-visional. Here for the

 

sake of exposition I shall use a shorthand definition:




((lv))

structuralism is an attempt to isolate the general structures of human activ

ity. Thus the

 

structuralism I speak of is largely the study of literature, linguistics, anthropology, history,

 

socio-ecnomics, psychology. A structure is a unit composed of a few elements that are

 

invariably found in the same relationship within the “activity” being described. The unit

 

cannot be broken down into its single elements, for the unity of the structure is defined not so

 

much by the substantive nature of the elements as by their relationship. When Aristotle

 

described tragedy as “the imitation of an action that is serious and also, as having magnitude,

 

complete in itself .. . with incidents arousing pity and fear, wherewith to accomplish its

 

catharsis of such emotions,” he was describing the active structure of tragedy. We know

 

Freud’s psychic “description” in terms of the narcis

sistic and oedipal structures. In Roland

 

Barthes’s words: “. . . to find in it [the object] certain mobile fragments whose differential

 

situation engenders a certain meaning; the fragment has no meaning in itself, but it is none

-

theless such that the slightest variation wrought in its configuration pro

duces a change in the

 

whole.”

55

 Derrida, like Nietzsche, would find it merely symptomatic of the human desire for

 

control to isolate such “units” in an “object” in any but the most provisional way: “. . . . a

 

structural study of the historical ensemble—notions, institutions. . . . How are these ele

ments

 

in ‘the historical ensemble’ organized? What is a ‘notion’? Do philo

sophical notions have a

 

privilege? How do they relate to scientific con

cepts?” 

(ED 70)

The study of human activity in terms of the structure of the sign we might call semiotic or

 

semiological structuralism. Can Derrida—substi

tuting the structure of writing (the sign “sous

 

rature”) for the structure of the sign—simply be dubbed a grammatological structuralist

 

historian of philosophy, and there an end? No doubt. But to grasp the implications of that

 

formulaic description, we might launch, not only a shorthand defini

tion, but a thumbnail

 

“historical outline,” that would be useful for the exigencies of the present discussion. It must

 

of course be remembered that any such outline would have to be rigorously undone if “the

 

direct object” of study were the movement “itself.”

In the broad sense, structuralist descriptions have always been with us; it is customary to cite

 

Aristotle and Plato. In the narrow sense, however, it is customary to locate the beginnings of

 

modem structuralism in the fol-lowing proper names: the Russian Formalists in literary

 

criticism, Marcel Mauss in anthropology, Ferdinand de Saussure and N. S. Troubetzkoy in

 

linguistics. The Formalists, reacting against what seemed like the fluid, rhapsodic style of

 

Symbolist criticism (deconstructed, Symbolist criticism establishes its own variety of rigor),

 

engaged in the isolation of objective categories descriptive of the “literariness” of the literary

 

text.

56

 Out of this enthusiasm came such significant texts as Vladimir Propp’s codification of

((lvi))

motif/structures in folk tales,57 motif/structures that can be seen to inhabit the most

 

sophisticated narratives. East European Structuralism has been developing the Formalists’

 

investigative methods over the last few decades, but Derrida is most concerned with

 

structuralism as it came to live in France.

For the study of the “laws” of the variations in the configuration of structures, the working

 

analogies came from the study of linguistic struc

tures. Troubetzkoy, studying the

 

configuration of phonemes in the produc

tion of meaning, gave one analogy. Ferdinand de

 

Saussure, describing the structure of the sign itself—“I mean by sign the whole that results

 




from the associating of the signifier with the signified”58—gave another. Structuralist activity

 

found its analogies in linguistics and semiotics. Claude Lévi-Strauss provides some

 

acknowledgements. Abundantly to Marcel Mauss in his Introduction to 

Sociologie et

 

anthropologie: “. . . . 

inspiring ourselves by Mauss’s precept that all social phenomena may

 

be assimilated into lan

guage, we see . . . [in them] the conscious expression of a semantic

 

forma

tion.”59 Here to Troubetzkoy (for Derrida’s own discussion of this passage we should

 

turn to pages 151 f. [Io2 f.] of 

Of Grammatology) :

Structural linguistics will certainly play the same renovating role with respect to the social

 

sciences that nuclear physics, for example, has played for the physi

cal sciences. In what does

 

this revolution consist :.. ? N. Troubetzkoy, the illustrious founder of structural linguistics, . . .

 

reduced the structural method to four basic operations. First, structural linguistics shifts from

 

the study of 

con

scious linguistic phenomena to study of their 

unconscious 

infrastructure;

 

second, it does not treat 

terms 

as independent entities, taking instead as its basis of analysis

 

the 

relations 

between terms; third, it introduces the concept of 

system—“. . . 

it shows concrete

 

phonemic systems and elucidates their struc

ture”—; finally, structuralist linguistics aims at

 

discovering 

general laws. . . . 

In the study of kinship problems (and, no doubt, the study of

 

other problems as well), the anthropologist finds himself in a situation which formally

 

resembles that of the structural linguist. Like phonemes, kinship terms are elements of

 

meaning; like phonemes, they acquire meaning only if they are integrated into systems.

 

“Kinship systems,” like “phonemic systems,” are built by the mind on the level of

 

unconscious thought. Finally, the recurrence of kinship patterns .. . in scattered regions of the

 

globe and in fundamentally different societies, leads us to believe that, in the case of kinship

 

as well as linguistics, the observable phenomena result from the action of laws which are

 

general but implicit.60

Roman Jakobson, a member of the Prague School of Formalism, encoun

tered Claude Lévi-

Strauss in the United States in the 1950s. One account of the rise of “structuralism” is that

 

what is recognized today as the main-stream structuralist method of the interpretation of texts

 

arose out of this temporary conjunction.61

I indulge in this sort of sweeping historical fiction because, as I have sug-

((lvii))

gested, Derrida’s criticism of “structuralism,” even as he inhabits it, would be a sweeping one.

 

It would relate to the possibility of a general law. The law of differance is that any law is

 

constituted by postponement and self-difference. The possibility of a general law is threatened

 

on so general a level.

Derrida would also problematize the possibility of objective description. A structuralist

 

statement of structuralist objectives bases itself on the dis

tinction between subject and object.

 

Structuralist conclusions are the object illuminated by the subject: “The goal of all

 

structuralist activity, whether reflexive or poetic, is to reconstruct 

(reconstituer) 

an ‘object’ in

 

such a way as to manifest thereby the rules of its functioning (the ‘functions’) of this object.

 

Structure is therefore actually a 

simulacrum 

of the object, but a directed 

interested

 

simulacrum, since the imitated object makes some-thing appear which remained invisible or, .

 

. . unintelligible in the natural object.”62 For Derrida, however, a text, as we recall, whether

 

“literary,” “psychic,” “anthropological,” or otherwise, is a play of presence and absence, a

 

place of the effaced trace. (“If it is to be radically conceived, [the play] must be thought of

 




before the alternative of presence and absence” 

[ED 426, SC 264].) 

And textuality is not only

 

true of the “object” of study but also true of the “subject” that studies. It effaces the neat

 

distinction between subject and object. The grammatological structure as a tool of description

 

is that structure which forever eludes answering the question “what is . . . ?”—the basis of

 

objective description. Even as it re-mains legible as a structure, it erases the aim of

 

structuralism—to provide objective descriptions.

Speaking generally again, it may be said that the method of structuralism takes into account

 

that its 

objects of study 

cannot have had simple origins in the sovereign subject of an “author.”

 

But the power of the 

investigating subject, 

which brings intelligibility to the natural object by

 

imitating it as a structure, in spite of the many delicate argumentations around it, cannot

 

ultimately be denied within the framework of structural study. A structure, it must be repeated,

 

is the natural object plus the subjective intelligence of the structuralist: “the simulacrum is

 

intellect added to object, and this addition has an anthropological value, in that it is man

 

himself, his history, his situation, his freedom, and the very resistance which nature offers to

 

his mind.”63

The notion of “communication” (a “function” of human structures), important to structuralism

 

as a tool of investigation, also carries with it the notion of unified subjects, of meaning as

 

portable property: “. . . . 

com

munication, 

which, in fact, implies the 

transmission charged

 

with passing, from one subject to the other, the identity 

of a 

signified 

object of a 

meaning 

or a

 

concept in 

principle separable from the process of passage and of the signifying operation.”

 

(Pos F 

34).

((lviii))

Derrida finds the concept of the binary sign itself, in its role as the guide of this objective

 

enterprise, committed to a science of presence. Barthes writes eloquently: “The sign is not

 

only the object of a particular knowl

edge, but also the object of a 

vision, 

analogous to the

 

vision of the celestial spheres in Cicero’s 

Somnium Scipionis 

or related to the molecular repre

-

sentations used by chemists; the semiologist 

sees 

the sign moving in the field of signification,

 

he enumerates its valences, traces their configuration: the sign is, for him, a sensous idea.”64

 

And Derrida, diagnosing the symp

toms of this longing for presence, writes: “. . . a semiology .

 

. . whose .. . concepts and fundamental presuppositions are most precisely locatable from

 

Plato to Husserl, passing by way of Aristotle, Rousseau, Hegel, etc.” (PosF 33)

Yet since, as I have argued, the structure of the grammè is the sign under erasure—both

 

conserving 

and effacing the sign, Derrida must make use of the concept of the sign. His

 

relationship to structuralism is therefore inti

mate. In an interview with Julia Kristeva, Derrida

 

points out that Saussure’s binary concept of the sign, questioning the separable primacy of

 

meaning—the transcendental signified—pointed a way out of the metaphysics of presence:

Saussurian semiology noted, against tradition, that the signified was insepa

rable from the

 

signifier, that [they] are the two faces of one and the same pro

duction. . . . By showing that “it

 

is impossible for sound alone, the material element, to belong to the language” and that “[in

 

its essence the linguistic signifier] is in no way phonic” (p. 164)

65

; by desubstantializing at

 

once the signified content and the “substance of expression”—which is therefore no longer

 

exclusively the phone—.... Saussure contributed greatly to turning against the metaphysical

 

tradition the concept of the sign that he borrowed from it. (Pos F 28)




Derrida analyzes Saussure’s 

Cours de linguistique générale 

and the lin

guistics of the first half

 

of the present century in the chapter of this book entitled “Linguistics and Grammatology,”

 

and the argument about Saus-sure is best presented there. We might simply say that Saussure

 

was not a grammatologist because, having launched the binary sign, he did not pro

ceed to put

 

it under erasure. The binary opposition within the Saussurian sign is in a sense paradigmatic

 

of the structure of structuralist methodology. “We must doubtless resort to pairings like those

 

of 

signifier/signified 

and 

synchronic/diachronic 

in order to approach what distinguishes struc

-

turalism from other modes of thought.”66

In the passage where Lévi-Strauss acknowledges his debt to Troubetzkoy, for example, we

 

notice the reference to a study of the 

unconscious 

infra-structure. In Derrida, via Freud, there

 

would be a difficulty in setting up the opposition between the conscious and the unconscious

 

within the sub-

((lix))

ject as the founding principle of a systematic study. The unconscious is undecidable, either the

 

always already other, out of reach of psychic descrip

tions, or else it is thoroughly and

 

constitutively implicated in so-called con

scious activity. Further, as I have pointed out, the

 

opposition of the subject and the object, upon which the possibility of objective descriptions

 

rests, is also questioned by the grammatological approach. The description of the object is as

 

contaminated by the patterns of the subject’s desire as is the subject constituted by that never-

fulfilled desire. We can go yet further and repeat that the structure of binary oppositions in

 

general is questioned by grammatology. Differance invites us to undo the need for balanced

 

equa

tions, to see if each term in an opposition is not after all an accomplice of the other: “At

 

the point where the concept of differance intervenes . . . all the conceptual oppositions of

 

metaphysics, to the extent that they have for ultimate reference the presence of a present, . . .

 

(signifier/signified; sensi

ble/intelligible; writing/speech; speech [parole]/language 

[langue];

 

dia

chrony/synchrony; space/time; passivity/activity etc.) become non-perti

nent.” (Pos 41)

It is therefore not too extravagant to say that “writing” or “differance” is the structure that

 

would deconstruct structuralism—as indeed it would deconstruct all texts, being, as we shall

 

see, the always already differentiated structure of deconstruction.

It should by now be clear where the structuralists have stopped short, or what they did not

 

begin with. Thev have not thought the “sous rature.”67 It is as if they have grasped only

 

Nietzsche’s “knowledge,” showing us the interpretive power working through human society,

 

so that all its studies become “genealogical,” an unending decipherment of sign-chains. How

 

close to that aspect of Nietzsche this passage from Roland Barthes sounds! : “... structural

 

man . . . too listens for the natural in culture, and constantly perceives in it not so much stable,

 

finite, ‘true’ meanings as the shudder of an enormous machine which is humanity tirelessly

 

undertaking to create meaning, without which it would no longer be human.”68 But it is also

 

as if the gravest lesson of that knowledge, its need for abdication, has not been imagined by

 

the structuralists. Nongrammatological structuralism cannot afford to cultivate the will to

 

ignorance: 

“Homo significans: such 

would be the new man of structural inquiry!” 69

The solution is not merely to say “I shall not objectify.” It is rather to recognize at once that

 

there is no other language but that of “objectifica

tion” and that any distinction between

 

“subjectification” and “objectifica

tion” is as provisional as the use of any set of hierarchized

 

oppositions. Derrida sets this forth most energetically in two early essays where he deals with

 




two structuralist critics who take elaborate precautions against objectification. I have already

 

referred to one—“Structure, Sign, and Play in the Sciences of Man”—where Derrida

 

interprets Lévi-Strauss’s attempt

((lx))

at a mythomorphic criticism of myth. 

The other is «

 

Cogito et l’histoire de la folie

 

»—a

 

critique of Michel Foucault’s 

Histoire de la folie à l’âge classique.70

Foucault writes, writes Derrida, as if he 

“knew 

what madness meant” 

(ED 

66). Foucault

 

speaks thus for Reason, madness’s other—if his own binary opposition is to be trusted. Yet he

 

wishes to speak for “madness 

itself” (ED 

56), write “the archaeology of [its] silence.”71 But

 

how can this be more than merely rhetorical? For an archaeolgy is perpetrated through

 

discourse, imposing reason’s syntax upon folly’s silence. Indeed Foucault recognizes the

 

problem and on occasion articulates it.

But, “to say the difficulty, to say the difficulty of saying, is not yet to surmount it” 

(ED 

61).

 

Foucault sidesteps precisely this issue, says Der-rida, by misreading Descartes.

Foucault sees in Descartes one of the exemplary separators of reason and madness. Derrida’s

 

reading of Descartes on folly is an elegant bit of deconstruction; he spots the moment of the

 

forgetting of the trace in Descartes’ text. Descartes, he argues, gives the name “folly” to the

 

fire-

reflexive 

cogito—before 

the “I think” can be reflected upon and pro

nounced. In the

 

prereflexive cogito “folly” and “I think” are inter-changeable, intersubstitutable. There the

 

distinction between reason and folly does not appear. There the “cogito” cannot be

 

communicated, made to appear to another self like my own. But when Descartes begins to

 

speak and reflect upon the cogito, he gives it a temporal dimension, and distinguishes it from

 

madness. The relationship between the prereflexive cogito (which is also madness) and the

 

temporal cogito (which is distinct from madness) is thus analogous to that between the

 

precomprehended question of Being and the propositional concept of Being. The possibility

 

of discourse is lodged in the interminably repeated movement from the one to the other—

from “excess” to a “closed structure.” 

(ED 

94) Foucault, not recognizing this, still remains

 

confined within the structuralist science of investigation through oppositions.

This is a dated Foucault, the Foucault of the sixties. Even then he was violently unwilling to

 

be called a structuralist, and he gets into this section of my preface because he diagnoses an

 

age in terms of its 

epistémé, 

the self-defined structure of its knowing. This particular

 

characteristic of Foucault’s work has not disappeared. To diagnose the epistemic structure, he

 

has had, with repeated protestations to the contrary, to step out of epistemic struc

tures in

 

general, assuming that were possible. To write his “archaeologies,” he has had to analyze

 

metaphors privileged by a particular age in what Derrida would call “meta-metaphorics.” By

 

describing grammatology as “a history of the possibility of history that would no longer be an

 

archaeology,” (43, 28), Derrida seems to declare an advance over Foucault. And by deny-ing

 

the status of a positive science to grammatology, he “erases” the ad-

((lxi))

vance. Perhaps there is an attempt to rewrite the Foucauldian method in “The White

 

Mythology,” Derrida’s extended essay on metaphor:




Might we not dream . . . of some 

meta-philosophy, 

of a more general dis-course which would

 

still be of a philosophical kind, on metaphors of the “pri

mary degree,” on those non-true

 

metaphors which set philosophy ajar 

[entrouvert la philosophie]? 

There would be some

 

interest in work under the heading of a meta-metaphorics such as this. . . . First of all we shall

 

direct interest upon a certain 

usure 

[both attrition through wear and tear and supplementation

 

through usury] of metaphorical force in philosophical intercourse. It will be-come clear that

 

this usure is not a supervenient factor modifying a kind of trope-decay which is 

other-wise

 

destined to remain intact; 

on the contrary, it constitutes the very history and structure of

 

philosophical metaphor. 

(MP 

308, 249; “White Mythology” 61, 6; italics mine)

(It should be mentioned here that, at the end of the second edition of 

Histoire de la folie,

 

which appeared eleven years after the first, Foucault includes a twenty-page rebuttal of

 

Derrida’s critique, entitled “Mon corps, ce papier, ce feu.” Foucault’s analysis of Derrida’s

 

misreading [as he thinks] of Descartes is thorough and often convincing, and should be

 

examined carefully. For our purposes here, it suffices to note that Foucault does not address

 

himself to the precomprehended cogito. His point is rather to prove that Descartes does indeed

 

exclude madness as he does not exclude the dream. He takes Derrida’s reading to be “a

 

generalization of doubt,” a taking away of the Cartesian certitude from Descartes. This

 

reading is, of course, not altogether false, but it leaves untouched the configuration of

 

Derrida’s more interesting suggestion that the Cartesian certitude is grounded on a category

 

that may just as easily be described as either certitude or doubt, neither certitude nor doubt. In

 

fact when, speaking against Derrida, Foucault shows us that Descartes 

disqualifies 

[rather

 

than excludes] madness from giving evidence, as an “excessive and impossible proof” [p.

 

596], we may suggest that Foucault’s reading in this case is not very different from Derrida’s.)

But the most interesting thing about Foucault’s rebuttal is the virulence at the end. I shall

 

make no attempt to defend Derrida here, but will ex-tract a passage from Foucault to give you

 

a taste of the hostility toward the threat of the “sous rature”—a concept that Foucault, in these

 

lines, does not seem to have carefully attended—that is not necessarily confined to Michel

 

Foucault:

Today Derrida is the most decisive representative of a [classical] system in its final glory; the

 

reduction of discursive practice to textual traces; the elision of the events that are produced

 

there in order to retain nothing but marks for a reading; the invention of voices behind texts in

 

order not to have to analyse the modes of implication of the subject in discourse; assigning the

 

spoken and the unspoken in the text to an originary placè in order not to have to reinstate

((1xii))

the discursive practises -in the field of transformations where they are effectuated. ... It is an

 

historically sufficiently determined little pedagogy which manifests itself most visibly. A

 

pedagogy that tells the pupil that there is nothing outside of the text, but that within it, in its

 

interstices, in its white spaces and unspokennesses, the reserve of the origin reigns; it is not at

 

all necessary to search elsewhere, for exactly here, to be sure not in the words, but in words as

 

erasures, in their 

grill, 

“the meaning of being” speaks itself. A pedagogy that conversely gives

 

to the voice of the teacher that unlimited sovereignty which permits them to read the text

 

indefinitely [p. 6oa].




Derrida defends psychoanalysis against Foucault, who calls it “a mono

logue of reason 

about

 

madness.”72 “It is not by chance that it is only today that such a project [as Foucault’s] could

 

be formed. . . . It must be sup-posed that . a certain liberation of madness has begun, that

 

psychiatry, in however small a way, is open, that the concept of madness as unreason, if it

 

ever had a unity, has been dislocated.” 

(ED 

61)

Jacques Lacan, the great contemporary interpreter of Freud, is an in

stigator of such a

 

dislocation. Not only has he underwritten Freud’s own denial of a difference in kind between

 

the “normal” and the “abnormal” psyche, but he has also rejected the dogma, launched

 

according to him by American ego psychologists,73 that the ego is the primary determinant of

 

the psyche. He works, rather, with a “subject” which can never be a “total personality,” the

 

“exercise of whose function” is to be forever di

vided from the object of its desire (Lacan

 

computes the structural rela

tionships among need, demand for love, and desire), and to

 

constitute itself in the distortive play of metaphor and metonymy—displacement and con

-

densation—that forever distances the other, the object of its desire, from itself. 

(Ec 692) 

Freud

 

had not allowed verbality to lodge deeper than the Preconscious, thus protecting the

 

metaphysical alterity of the Uncon

scious. Lacan extends Freud in a direction that Derrida

 

would endorse. He defines the unconscious in terms of the structure of a language: “It is not

 

only man who speaks, but ... in man and by man it [id] speaks, ... his nature becomes woven

 

by the effects where the structure of language, whose material he becomes, is recovered.” (Ec

 

688-89)

Derrida is aware of the affinity between Lacan’s thought and his own: “In France, the ‘literary

 

criticism’ marked by psychoanalysis had not asked the question of the text. . . . Although

 

Lacan is not directly and syste

matically interested in the so-called ‘literary’ text, . . . the

 

general 

question of the text is incessantly at work [in his discourse].” (FV 100-01)

Yet in spite of, perhaps because of, this proximity, the relationship be

tween these two men is

 

charged with unease. Dissociating himself from the “perversions” spawned by his own work

 

between 1953 and 1967, Lacan

((lxiii))

finds it necessary to interject: “. . . my discourse . . . is a different kind of buoy in this rising

 

tide of the signifier, of the signified, of the ‘it speaks,’ of trace, of 

grammè, 

of lure, of myth,

 

from the circulation of which I have now withdrawn. Aphrodite of this foam, there has arisen

 

from it latterly 

di f f erance, 

with an 

a.

”74 Derrida, in an uncharacteristically positivistic ges-

ture, has settled the question of Lacan’s influence upon himself in a long footnote to an

 

interview. (Pos F 117 f., Pos E II. 

43-44) 

But let us admit that, on occasion, Derrida will not

 

allow Lacan the same playfulness with terms that he allows himself 75

The relationship between Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida has no apparent bearing upon

 

the subject matter of the 

Grammatology. 

But the controlled and limited polemic between them

 

does illuminate two issues important for an understanding of the 

Grammatology 

within the

 

general framework of Derrida’s thought: the place of “truth” in discourse and the place of the

 

signifier in general.

First, then, a consideration of the place of “truth” in Lacanian discourse as Derrida interprets

 

it.




The goal of Lacanian analysis is to draw out and establish the “truth” of the subject. It is not a

 

simple question of objectification of a subjective situation. For “no language can speak the

 

truth about truth, for the grounds of truth are that which it speaks, it cannot found itself in any

 

other way.” 

(Ec 867-68) 

“Language installs the dimension of truth (inconceivable outside of

 

discourse or what is structured as discourse), even as it ex

cludes all guarantee of this truth.”

 

Yet, just as, even while establishing the notion of “sous rature,” Heidegger could not

 

relinquish a nostalgia for undoing forgetfulness, so Lacan’s thought must work in terms of a

 

reference point that is the 

primary truth. 

The passage above continues: “In relation to this

 

absence of guarantee, a primary affirmation is en

gendered that is also the 

primary truth.” (Sc

 

I. 

98) 

As in Heidegger the answer to the precomprehended question of Being might be read as

 

a self-sufficient signified of all signifiers, so Lacan’s ineffable primary truth be-comes its own

 

guarantee. Derrida makes the Heideggerian connections explicit:

Truth—cut off from [or adulterated with, 

coupée de] 

knowledge—is constantly determined as

 

revelation, non-veiling, that is: necessarily as presence, presenta

tion of the present, “Being of

 

being” 

(Anwesenheit) 

or, in a more literally Heideggerian mode, as the unity of veiling and

 

unveiling. The reference to the 

results 

of Heidegger’s progress is often explicit in this form

 

(“the radical ambiguity indicated by Heidegger to the extent that truth means revelation,” [Ec]

 

p. 166, “the passion for unveiling which has an object: the truth.” [Ec] p. 193, etc.) (Pos F

 

117, 

Pos 

E 

II.

43)

Freud had given “a metaphysical name” to the radical alterity inhabiting the psyche—the

 

unconscious. It appears to Derrida that, in spite of giving

((lxiv))

to the unconscious the structure of a language, Lacan has contrived to entrench Freud’s

 

metaphysical suggestions by making the unconscious the seat of verification and “truth.”

 

Lacan speaks often and at length about the “veritable subject of the unconscious” 

(Ec 

417)

 

and of “the truth” of the unconscious as the “cause” of the signifying symptomatology of the

 

subject. The analyst interprets the distorted 

énonciation 

(speech event) of the subject’s

 

symptom into the true 

énoncé 

(narrated event) of the unconscious: “. . . to the extent that it

 

[the subject] 

speaks, it is in the place of the Other that it begins to constitute that truthful lie

 

[mensonge veridique] 

by way of which what partakes of desire on the level of the

 

unconscious gets itself going.”76

“

Le mensonge veridique.” This, Derrida feels, is too clearly Lacan’s atti

tude toward fiction.

 

Whereas Derrida sees “truth” (if one can risk that word) as being constituted by “fiction” (if

 

one can risk 

that 

word), Lacan seems to use fiction as a clue to truth. There is a fairly detailed

 

discussion of this in Derrida’s “Le facteur de la vérité”: “Once one had distinguished, as does

 

the entire philosophical tradition, between truth and reality, it goes without saying that truth

 

‘establishes itself in the structure of a fiction.’ Lacan strongly insists upon the opposition

 

truth/reality which he advances as a paradox. This opposition, as orthodox as possible,

 

facilitates the pas-sage of truth through fiction: common sense will always have made the

 

division between reality and fiction.” 

(FV 

128) Here again, Lacan seems to Derrida to have

 

carried forward Freud’s less adventurous side—the side that solves puzzles—at the expense of

 

the Freud who opens up the gram

matology of the psyche. Lacan’s misreading of the quotation

 

from Crébillon at the end of Poe’s “The Purloined Letter”—he substitutes “destin” (destiny)

 

for the more problematic “dessein” (design)—is perhaps para

digmatic of this attitude.




Derrida’s second point of disagreement with Lacan relates to the “trans

cendental signifier.” In

 

a note on page 

32 

(page 

324

) of the 

Gram

matology 

Derrida cautions us that, when we teach

 

ourselves to reject the notion of the primacy of the signified—of meaning over word—we

 

should not satisfy our longing for transcendence by giving primacy to the sig

nifier—word

 

over meaning. And, Derrida feels that Lacan might have perpetrated precisely this.

The signifiers in Lacan are the symbols that relate the subject through the structure of desire

 

to the unconscious. “So runs the signifier’s answer [to the subject], above and beyond all

 

significations: ‘You think you act when I stir you at the mercy of the bonds through which I

 

knot your desires. Thus do they grow and multiply in objects, bringing you back to the

 

fragmentation of your shattered childhood.” 

(Ec 40, FF 71–72) “You 

will grasp why the

 

relationship of the subject to the signifier is the reference that we would place in the

 

foreground of a general rectification

((lxv))

of analytic theory, because it is as primary and constituting in the setting up of the analytical

 

experience, as it is primary and constituting in the radical function of the unconscious.” 77 It

 

has “priority in relation to the signified.” 

(Ec 29, FF 59) 

And “the signifier alone guarantees

 

the theo

retical coherence of the entirety 

[ensemble] 

[of the subject] as an entirety.” 

(Ec 414)

 

Each signifier in the subject is singular and indivisible. In this it shares, Derrida suggests, the

 

uniqueness and unassailable presence tra

ditionally accorded to the “idea.” For the hallmark of

 

a philosophically intelligible idea is that it can be infinitely repeated as the “same” idea: it is

 

singular and indivisible. 

(FV 

121, 126) 

To 

repeat our catechism: for Derrida, by contrast to all

 

this, the signifier and signified are interchange-able; one is the differance of the other; the

 

concept of the sign itself is no more than a legible ÿ et effaced, unavoidable tool. Repetition

 

leads to a simulacrum, not to the “same.”

Lacan’s radical description of the function of the signifier combines presence and absence.

 

“For the signifier is a unit in its very uniqueness, being by nature 

symbol only of an absence.”

 

(Ec 24, FF 29) 

It signifies a desire for some thing that the subject has not, the other of the

 

subject. And the master signifier of these signifiers of desire is the phallus, reflecting the

 

powerful human passions, the fear of castration (of the mother) in the male and the envy of

 

the penis in the female. This is not the phallus as an actual organ, penis or clitoris. It is the

 

phallus as 

a signifier, 

that can come to take the place of all signifiers signifying all desires for

 

all absences. “Its most profound relation: that by which the Ancients incarnated the Nous and

 

the Logos.” 

(Ec 695) 

“The phallus is a signifier, a signifier whose function . . . perhaps lifts

 

the veil from that which it held in the mysteries. For it is the signifier destined to design in

 

their entirety the effects of the signified, to the extent that the signifier conditions them by its

 

signifier-presence 

[présence de signifiant].” (Ec 690) 

The position of the phallus on the chain

 

of signifiers to 

which 

it belongs even as it makes it possible” 

(FV 

132) 

is, 

strictly speaking,

 

transcendental. 

Heidegger’s Being, even under erasure, could be a transcendental signified.

 

Lacan’s phallus, signify-ing an absence, is a transcendental signifier.

Within this sexual fable of the production of meaning, Derrida’s term is dissemination.

 

Exploiting a false etymological kinship between semantics and semen, Derrida offers this

 

version of textuality: A sowing that does not produce plants, but is simply infinitely repeated.

 

A semination that is not insemination but disseminaton, seed spilled in vain, an emission that

 

can-not return to its origin in the father. Not an exact and controlled polysemy, but a

 

proliferation of always different, always postponed meanings. Speak-ing of the purloined

 




letter as signifier, Lacan writes: “. . . a letter always arrives at its destination.” (Ec 

41, FF 72)

 

It “always might not” 

(FV 

115) is the mode of Derrida’s answer. Castration, the lack of

 

superintendence

((lxvi))

by phallic authority, is what transforms the “author” or the “book” into a “text.” Presence can

 

be articulated only if it is 

fragmented 

into discourse; “castration” and dismemberment being

 

both a menace to and the condi

tion of the possibility of discourse. Somewhat extravagantly,

 

the phallus may itself be seen as the knife that severs itself to perpetuate its dis

semination.

 

One begins to suspect that a phallocentric fable of meaning simply will not suffice.

In what it seems satisfying to me to construe as a [feminist med kryss] gesture, Derrida offers

 

us a hymeneal fable. The hymen is the always folded (there-fore never single or simple) space

 

in which the pen writes its dissemina

tion. “Metaphorically” it means the consummation of

 

marriage. “Literally” its presence signifies the absence of consummation. This and/or

 

structure bodies forth the play of presence and absence. The hymen undoes oppo

sitions

 

because it acts as it suffers. This fabulous hymen, anagram of 

hymme, “

always intact as it is

 

always ravished, a screen, a tissue,” undoes “the assurance of mastery” 

(Dis z6o). 

I refer the

 

reader to Derrida’s “La double séance,” where the hymen is lavishly (un) folded.

“

If we imagine one hand writing upon the surface of the mystic writing-pad while another

 

periodically raises its covering sheet from the wax slab, we shall have a concrete

 

representation of the way in which I tried to picture the functioning of the perceptual

 

apparatus of our mind” 

(GW 

XIV ii, SE XIX 234). Derrida’s legend of meaning undoes

 

Freud’s phallocentrism through a double-jointed notion like the Freudian mystic writing-pad

 

sketched above. No longer castration (the realization of sexual difference as the model for the

 

difference between signifier and signified) as the origin of signification. Rather 

involve 

that

 

sexual difference in the “concrete representation” (in the long run these words must be

 

criticized, of course) of the making of meaning: dissemination into the hymen. Into the (n)

 

ever-virgin, (n) ever-violated hymen of interpretation, always sup

plementing through its fold

 

which is also an opening, is spilled the seed of meaning; a seed that scatters itself abroad

 

rather than inseminates. Or, turning the terms around, the playfully disseminating rather than

 

pro

prietorially hermeneutic gesture of interpretation (n) ever penetrates the hymen of the text.

 

It is a sexual union forever deferred. In a triumph of colloquialism, Derrida writes what might

 

be roughly translated as “It [dis

semination] comes too soon.” But in the French the play is

 

more pro

nounced: “Elle—le [le sens] laisse d’avance tomber” 

(Dis 

3oo)—“She lets it [the

 

meaning] fall in advance.” Derrida takes advantage of the simple grammatical fact that

 

dissemination—the male act—being a noun ending in “tion,” is feminine in French. The

 

pronoun “elle” confuses sexual agency. And the “—“ between subject and object-predicate

 

commemorates the deferment inhabiting the hymeneal dissemination of meaning.

((lxvii))

Derrida would see in Lacan’s idiom of “good and bad faith,” of “au

thenticity,” of “truth,” the

 

remnants of a postwar “existentialist” ethic. He would see in Lacan many unacknowledged

 

debts to the Hegelian and Hus

serlian phenomenology that the psychoanalyst ridicules (Pos F

 

117, Pos E II. 43). Lacan does abundantly present himself as the prophet who is energetically

 

unveiling the “true” Freud. Such a vocation offends Derrida the deconstructor, for whom the

 

critic’s selfhood is as vulnerable with textuality as the text itself.




The previous section concerned itself with three magistral gram

matologues: Friedrich

 

Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger. We come back to them in another way at the

 

end of this section. For Derrida the provisionally locatable priming-point of structuralism, the

 

awareness of the structurality of things, does not lie only in the discovery of the “objective”

 

structures of language, providing “scientific” models for the study of “man.” It lies also in the

 

rigorous reopening of the question of the relationship between “subjective” and “objective”

 

structures, a structure of desire that puts the status of the human being and of that very dis

-

tinction in question:

Where and how does this decentering, this notion of the structurality of struc

ture, occur? It

 

would be somewhat naive to refer to an event, a doctrine, or an author in order to designate

 

this occurrence. It is no doubt part of the totality of an era 78 . . . . Nevertheless, if I wished to

 

give some sort of indication by choosing one or two “names,” and by recalling those authors

 

in whose discourses this occurrence has most nearly maintained its most radical formulation, I

 

would probably cite the Nietzschean critique of metaphysics, the critique of the concepts of

 

being and truth, for which were substituted the concepts of play, interpretation, and sign (sign

 

without truth present); the Freudian critique of self-presence, that is, the critique of

 

consciousness, of the subject, of self-identity and self-proximity or self-possession; and, more

 

radically, the Heideg

gerian destruction of metaphysics, of ontotheology, of the determination

 

of being as presence. 

(ED 

411-12, SC 249—2)

IV

The launching of the structural method meant an “inflation of the sign ‘language’,” and thus,

 

as we have seen, an “inflation of the sign itself.” (15, 6) And this, in fact, meant an inflation,

 

not of the graphic, but of the phonic sign, of the rôle of the element of sound in the

 

production of meaning, language as speech. Chapter z of the 

Grammatology 

describes how

 

Saussure prescribed linguistics to be a study of speech alone, rather than speech and writing.

 

The emphasis is shared by Jakobson, by Lévi-

((lxviii))

Strauss, indeed by all semiological structuralism. Lacan, dealing ostensibly with the signifier

 

alone, sees it as half of a 

“phonematic 

opposition” (Ec 414) and calls the subject’s language,

 

when it indicates the charge of the truth of the unconscious—a “full 

speech” [parole pleine].

In the 

Grammatology 

Derrida suggests that this rejection of writing as an appendage, a mere

 

technique, and yet a menace built into speech—in effect, a scapegoat—is a symptom of a

 

much broader tendency. He relates this phonocentrism to logocentrism—the belief that the

 

first and last things are the Logos, the Word, the Divine Mind, the infinite understanding of

 

God, an infinitely creative subjectivity, and, closer to our time, the self-presence of full self-

consciousness. In the 

Grammatology 

and elsewhere, Derrida argues that the evidence for this

 

originary and teleologic presence has customarily been found in the voice, the 

phonè. 

This is

 

most clearly pre

sented in terms of Husserlian thought in Chapter 6, “The Voice that Keeps

 

Silence,” of 

Speech and Phenomena. 

We have seen how, according to Derrida, Husserl’s text

 

is tortured by a suppressed insight that the Living Present is always already inhabited by

 

difference. What allows Husserl to operate this suppression is the evidence for self-presence

 

that he finds in the voice—not the “real” voice, but the principle of the voice in our interior

 




soliloquy: “Why is the phoneme the most ‘ideal’ of signs? .. . When I speak, it belongs to the

 

phenomenological essence of this opera

tion that 

I hear myself 

[je m’entende: 

hear and

 

understand] at the same time 

that I speak. . . . As pure auto-affection, the operation of hearing

 

oneself speak seems to reduce even the inward surface of one’s own body. :.. This auto-

affection is no doubt the possibility for what is called sub

jectivity.” (VP 86-87, 88, 89; SP 77,

 

79)

The suggestion is, then, that this phonocentrism-logocentrism relates to centrism itself—the

 

human desire to posit a “central” presence at beginning and end:

The notion of the sign . . . remains within the heritage of that logocentrism which is also a

 

phonocentrism: absolute proximity of voice and being, of voice and the meaning of being, of

 

voice and the ideality of meaning. . . We already have a foreboding that phonocentrism

 

merges with the historical de-termination of the meaning of being in general as 

presence, 

with

 

all the sub-determinations which depend on this general form . . . (presence of the thing to the

 

sight as 

eidos, 

presence as substance/essence/existence 

(ousia), 

temporal presence as point

 

(stigmè) 

of the now or of the moment 

(nun), 

the self-presence of the cogito, consciousness,

 

subjectivity, the co-presence of the other and of the self, intersubjectivity as the intentional

 

phenomenon of the ego, and so forth). Logocentrism would thus support the determination of

 

the being of the entity as presence. (23, 11—12)

Lacan’s phallocentrism, extending, as Derrida sees it, Freud’s metaphysical bondage, fits into

 

this pattern: “Freud, like his followers, only 

described 

the

((lxix))

necessity of phallogocentrism. . . . It is neither an ancient nor a speculative mistake. . . . It is

 

an enormous and old root.” (FV 145)

It is this longing for a center, an authorizing pressure, that spawns hierarchized oppositions.

 

The superior term belongs to presence and the logos; the inferior serves to define its status

 

and mark a fall. The oppositions between intelligible and sensible, soul and body seem to

 

have lasted out “the history of Western philosophy,” bequeathing their burden to modem

 

linguistics’ opposition between meaning and word. The opposition be

tween writing and

 

speech takes its place within this pattern.

In the spirit of interpretation rather than of commentary, I have de-scribed the structure of

 

writing as the sign under erasure. It would now be appropriate to recall the opening pages of

 

this Preface, and call the struc

ture of writing “metaphysics under erasure.” Trace-structure,

 

everything always already inhabited by the track of something that is not itself, ques

tions

 

presence-structure. If “the present of self-presence . .. [seems] as indivisible as the blink of an

 

eye” (VP 66, SP 59), we must recognize that “there is a duration to the blink, and it closes the

 

eye.” (VP 73, SP 65) This presence of the trace and trace of the presence Derrida names

 

“archi

écriture.”

You will participate in the slow unfolding of these arguments in the first part of 

Of

 

Grammatology. 

I shall not “repeat” them at length here. But I shall point out again what I

 

have pointed at before: the name “writing” is given here to an entire structure of investigation,

 

not merely to “writing in the narrow sense,” graphic notation on tangible material. Thus 

Of

 

Gram

matology 

is not a simple valorization of writing over speech, a simple re-versal of the

 




hierarchy, a sort of anti-McLuhan. The repression of writing in the narrow sense is a pervasive

 

symptom of centrism and that is why much of our book concerns itself precisely with that.

 

The usual notion of writing in the narrow sense does contain the elements of the structure of

 

writing in general: the absence of the “author” and of the “subject-matter,” interpretability, the

 

deployment of a space and a time that is not “its own.” We “recognize” all this in writing in

 

the narrow sense and “repress” it; this allows us to ignore that everything else is also

 

inhabited by the structure of writing in general, that “the thing itself always escapes.” (VP

 

165, SP 104) Derrida’s choice of the words “writing” or “arche-writing” is thus not fortuitous.

 

Indeed, as Derrida repeatedly points out in the section on Lévi-Strauss, no rigorous distinction

 

between writing in the narrow and the general senses can be made. One slips into the other,

 

put-ting the distinction under erasure. Writing has had the negative privilege of being the

 

scapegoat whose exclusion represents the definition of the metaphysical enclosure.

Yet the choice of “writing” is also polemical, against the manifest phono-centrism of

 

structuralism. And this is precisely what has sometimes led to

((lxx))

that general misunderstanding, to the hasty view that Derrida seems to be restoring priority to

 

writing over speech in the study of language. But this is, of course, a very hasty view. A

 

careful reading of the 

Grammatology 

shows quickly that Derrida points out, rather, that

 

speech too—grafted within an empirical context, within the structure of speaker-listener,

 

within the general context of the language, and the possibiliy of the absence of the speaker-

listener (see page liii)—is structured as writing, that in this general sense, there is “writing in

 

speech” (ED 294). The first part of the book is entitled “Writing 

Before 

the Letter”—writing

 

before the fact of writing in the narrow sense. The second part, “Nature, Culture, Writing,”

 

shows how, in the texts of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Claude Lévi-Strauss, the declared

 

opposition between Nature and Culture is undone by both the empirical 

fact 

and the 

structure

 

of writing.

But if there is no structural distinction between writing and speech, the choice of “writing” as

 

an operative term is itself suspect, and a candi-date for legible erasure. Derrida puts it this

 

way: “This common root, which is not a root but the concealment of origin and which is not

 

common because it does not come to the same thing except with the unmonotonous insistence

 

of difference, the unnamable movement of 

difference-itself 

which I have strategically

 

nicknamed 

trace, reserve, 

or 

differance, 

can be called writing only within the 

historical

 

enclosure, that is to say within the boundaries of metaphysics.” (142, 93).

If, in other words, the history of metaphysics could have been different, this problematic

 

“common root” could have been named “speech.” But, according to the only metaphysics and

 

the only language we know or can know, the text of philosophy (of the so-called “sciences of

 

man,” of litera-ture . . .) is always written (we read it in books, on tape, through the psychic

 

machine); yet that text is always designated by philosophy (and so forth) to be speech (“Plato

 

says . . . ,” or at most, “it is as if Plato said ...”).”Writing” is “immediate(ly) repressed.” What

 

is written is read as speech or the surrogate of speech. “Writing” is the name of what is never

 

named. Given differance, however, it is a violence even to name it thus, or name it with 

a

 

proper 

name. One can tolerate nothing more than the nick-naming of 

bricolage.

Derrida would not privilege a signifier into transcendence. The move-ment of “difference-

itself,” precariously saved by its resident “contradic

tion,” has many nicknames: trace,

 




differance, reserve, supplement, dissemi

nation, hymen, greffe, pharmakon, parergon, and so

 

on. They form a chain where each may be substituted for the other, but not exactly (of course,

 

even two uses of the same word would not be exactly the same) : “no con

cept overlaps with

 

any other” (Pos F 109, Pos E 41). Each substitution is also a displacement, and carries a

 

different metaphoric charge, as Derrida reminds us often. He is particularly careful in the case

 

of “differance.” It is

((lxxi))

not easy to coin a word without seeming to privilege it as a term of final reference. The essay

 

“La différance” therefore spends a lot of energy on reminding us that 

“Differance 

is neither a

 

word 

nor a 

concept,” 

that it “is not theological, not even in the most negative order of

 

negative theology. The latter . . . always hastens to remind us that, if we deny the predicate of

 

existence to God, it is in order to recognize him as a superior, incon

ceivable, and ineffable

 

mode of being.” 

(MP 6, SP 

134) Yet giving a defi

nite name is a gesture of control as

 

authorized by metaphysical practice. At the end of the essay he must therefore caution: “For

 

us, differance remains a metaphysical name. . . . ‘Older’ than Being itself, our language has no

 

name for such a differance. . . . Not even the name ‘differance,’ which ... continually breaks

 

up in a chain of differant 

[différantes] 

substi

tutions.” 

(MP 

z8, SP 158–59) Of “hymen,” he

 

writes: “This word . . . is not indispensable. . . . If one replaced ‘hymen’ with ‘marriage’ or

 

‘crime,’ ‘identity’ or ‘difference,’ etc., the effect would be the same, except for a con

densation

 

or economic accumulation....” (ED 149–50)

He practices this caution in an unemphatic way. He does not hold on to a single conceptual

 

master-word for very long. “Arche-writing,” “trace,” “supplementarity,” such important

 

words in the 

Grammatology, 

do not remain consistently important conceptual master-words in

 

subsequent texts. Derrida’s vocabulary is forever on the move. He does not relinquish a term

 

altogether. He simply reduces it to the lower case of a common noun, where each context

 

establishes its provisional definition yet once again.

In the face of a textual energy that sets itself against congealment, I have already offered

 

approximative descriptions of trace, differance, dissemina

tion, hymen. Derrida’s own remark

 

to Jean-Louis Houdebine is not coy: “

Dissemination 

ultimately has no meaning and cannot be

 

channeled into a definition. I will make no attempt at that here and prefer to refer to the

 

working of the texts.” (Pos F 61, Pos E 37) Keeping that admonition in mind, let us say

 

briefly that “Spacing . . . ‘is’ the index of an irreducible out-side, and at the same time the

 

index of a 

movement, 

of a displacement which indicates an irreducible alterity.” (Pos F 107-

08, Pos E II. 40) As such it reflects the structure of differance, as does a holding in “reserve,”

 

and the 

“entame”—both 

beginning something and breaking into some-thing, both origin and

 

trace. The supplement “is” an 

“addition 

[that] comes to 

make up for a 

deficiency, ... to

 

compensate for a primordial non

self-presence.” (VP 97, SP 87) The structure of

 

supplementarity is set forth in the second half of 

Of Grammatology. 

The 

pharmakon 

is a

 

Greek word that includes among its meanings poison, medicine, magic potion. It is a word

 

used to describe writing in Plato’s 

Phaedrus. 

Plato describes Socrates as the pharmakeus—

poisoner, medicine man, sorcerer. Yet neither of writing nor of Socrates does Plato use the

 

related word 

pharmakos

scapegoat. Around this lacuna, Derrida recounts the fable of writing

 

(and

((lxxii))




Socrates) as scapegoat and welcomes 

pharmakon 

into this chain of substitu

tions for

 

“écriture.” 

Greffe 

is grafting-work, both horticultural and other wise (Dis 230). 

Parergon, a

 

latecomer among these nicknames, is both a frame and a supplementary “addition.”

Perhaps the definition of these nicknames should escape the form of mastery represented by

 

the copula “is.” In that spirit Derrida writes:

The 

pharmakon 

is neither the cure nor the poison, neither good nor evil, neither the inside nor

 

the outside, neither speech nor writing; the 

supplément 

is neither a plus nor a minus, neither

 

an outside nor the complement of an inside, neither an accident nor an essence, etc.; the

 

hymen is 

neither confusion nor distinction, neither identity nor difference, neither

 

consummation nor virginity, neither the veil nor the unveiling, neither the inside nor the

 

outside, etc.; the 

gramme is 

neither a signifier nor a signified, neither a sign nor a thing,

 

neither a presence nor an absence, neither a position nor a negation, etc.; 

l’espacement

 

[spacing] is neither space nor time; the 

entame is 

neither the [marred] integrity of a begin

ning

 

or of a simple cut nor simply the secondary state. Neither/nor is at once 

at once 

or rather 

or

 

rather. (Pos 

F 

59, Pos E I. 36)

This might seem an attractively truant world of relativism. But the fearful pleasure of a truant

 

world is the sense of an authority being defied. That absolute ground of authority Derrida

 

would deny. It would be a spurious pleasure for the literary critic to feel that this is a more

 

literary idiom than the austere propositional language we habitually associate with philosophy

 

proper. Textuality inhabits both, and the distinction between them remains to be

 

deconstructed. Once this is grasped, it may be noted that the awareness of the need for

 

deconstruction seems more congenial to the “irresponsible” discourse of what is

 

conventionally called literature. “The natural tendency of 

theory—of 

what unites philosophy

 

and science in the 

epistémè 

[the accepted description of 

how 

one knows]—will push rather

 

toward filling in the breach than toward forcing the enclosure. It was nor-mal that the

 

breakthrough was more secure and more penetrating in the areas of literature and poetry.”

 

(139, 92) The method of deconstruction has obvious interest for literary criticism.

 

Problematizing the distinction between philosophy and literature, it would read “even

 

philosophy” as “literature.”

(It is not enough, however, simply to exclaim over the presence of two seemingly

 

contradictory arguments within a text and declare a text satis

factorily disunified, and one’s

 

critical approach satisfactorily grammato

logical. 

If 

conventional criticism took pleasure in

 

establishing the “unified” meaning of a text, this brand of criticism would derive a matching

 

sense of mastery in disclosing a lack of unity. Such a critical method, relying heavily on

 

polysemy, would not face the radical playfulness of dissemina

tion. And the critical

 

conclusions themselves, disclosing opposites, would imply their reconciliation in the text.)

((lxxiii))

Speaking of Derrida and Heidegger, I attempted a brief description of deconstructive

 

procedure: to spot the point where a text covers, up its grammatological structure. Here let us

 

expand that description a little.

“

The desire for unity and order,” I wrote, “compels the author and the reader to balance the

 

equation that is the text’s system.” Derrida in fact relates this balancing of equations to the

 

great circular project of all philosophy in the most general sense.79 Hegel’s concept of the

 




interioriza

tion 

[Erinnerung] 

of philosophy is, in this reading, one version of a colossal

 

exigency. The related and powerful dogma in criticism, most recently under-written by the

 

critics of the Geneva School,80 is the circle of hermeneutics (interpretation rather than

 

exposition) : criticism as a movement of identi

fication between the “subjectivity” of the

 

author as implied in the text, and the “subjectivity” of the critic:

In fact, it is against the incessant reappropriation of this work of the simulacrum [as opposed

 

to the identical repetition] in a Hegelian type of dialectics .. . that I am attempting to channel

 

the critical enterprise, Hegelian idealism con

sisting precisely in 

sublating 

the binary

 

oppositions of classical idealism, of resolving their contradiction in a third term which turns

 

up to “aufheben,” to deny while uplifting, while idealizing, while sublimating in an

 

anamnestic interiority 

(Erinnerung 

[the German word also for memory]) while 

interning

 

difference in a presence to itself. (Pos F 59, 

Pos 

E 

I. 

36)

Hegel articulated the circle as his central theme (39-41, 

25-26), 

sublating the balanced binary

 

oppositions of classical philosophy. But even in a clas

sical philosophical text there seems to

 

be a moment when the possibility of the indefinite loss of meaning (dissemination) is pulled

 

back into the circuit of meaningfulness; the orderly oppositions functioning under the benign

 

supervision of order as presence, presence as order. Such moments, too, operate in the

 

interests of the circular project of philosophy. Derrida dis-engages them in such divergent

 

texts as those of Aristotle and Descartes. When Aristotle declares Zeno’s 

aporia 

(time both is

 

and is not) and steps over it without deconstructing it (MP 57, Eng 73-74), or when Descartes

 

proves God’s existence by means of the natural light (of reason), which, “as something

 

natural, . . . has its source in God, in the God whose existence has been put in doubt and then

 

demonstrated 

thanks to it” (MP 

319, WM 69-70), then Derrida points at that equation-

balancing at work. Speaking of the metaphor of the house chosen again and again by philo

-

sophical practice, Derrida suggests the pervasiveness of the circular project, and its

 

articulation in Hegel: “.... the borrowed dwelling 

[demeure] .. . 

expropriation, being-away-

from-home, but still in a dwelling, away from home but in someone’s home, a place of self-

recovery, self-recognition, self-mustering, self-resemblance, outside of the self in itself 

[hors

 

de soi en soi]. 

This is philosophical metaphor as a detour in (or in view of) the reap-

((lxxiv))

propriation, the second coming, the self-presence of the idea in its light. A metaphorical

 

journey from the Platonic 

eidos 

to the Hegelian Idea.” 

(MP 302, WM 55)

“

Outside of the self—in itself.” Derrida is doing more here than simply commenting on

 

philosophy’s circular project. He is describing one of the mainstays of this project—the

 

opposition between metaphor and truth—metaphor as a detour to truth, truth as “outside

 

itself” in the borrowed dwelling of a metaphor, but also “itself,” since the metaphor points at

 

its own truth.

Traditional textual interpretation founds itself on this particular under-standing of metaphor: a

 

detour to truth. Not only individual metaphors or systems of metaphors, but fiction in general

 

is seen as a detour to a truth that the critic can deliver through her interpretation. We do not

 

usually examine the premises of this familiar situation. If we did, we would find, of course,

 

that not only is there no pure language that is free from metaphor-the metaphor “is therefore

 

involved in the field it would be the purpose of a general ‘metaphorology’ to subsume” 

(MP

 

261, 

WM 

18); we would find also that the idea that fiction begins in the truth of the author and

 




ends in the uncovering of that truth by the critic is given the lie by our critical and

 

pedagogical practice. Although we customarily say that the text is autonomous and self-

sufficient, there would be no justification for our activity if we did not feel that the text

 

needed 

interpre

tation. The so-called secondary material is not a simple adjunct to the so-

called primary text. The latter inserts itself within the interstices of the former, filling holes

 

that are always already there. Even as it adds itself to the text, criticism supplies a lack in the

 

text and the gaps in the chain of criticism anterior to it. The text is not unique (the

 

acknowledged presence of polysemy already challenges that uniqueness); the critic creates a

 

sub

stitute. The text belongs to language, not to the sovereign and generating author. (New

 

Criticism, although it vigorously argued the self-enclosure and “organic unity” of the text, and

 

indulged in practice in the adulation of the author, had a sense of this last insight in its critique

 

of the “inten

tional fallacy.”) Derrida, questioning the unity of language itself, and put-ting

 

metaphor under erasure, radically opens up textuality.

Curiously enough, deconstructive criticism must take the “metaphoric” structure of a text very

 

seriously. Since metaphors are not reducible to truth, their own structures “as such” are part of

 

the textuality (or message) of the text.

And, as I have hinted before, deconstruction must also take into account the lack of

 

sovereignty of the critic himself. Perhaps this “will to ignorance” is simply a matter of

 

attitude, a realization that one’s choice of “evidence” is provisional, a self-distrust, a distrust

 

of one’s own power, the control of one’s vocabulary, a shift from the phallocentric to the

 

hymeneal. Even so,

((lxxv))

it is an important enough lesson for the critic, that self-professed custodian of the public

 

“meaning” of literature. The tone of the section entitled “The Exorbitant. Question of

 

Method” where Derrida “justifies” his choice of subject, gives us a glimpse of that lesson

 

learned. I quote a few sentences from it: “We must begin 

wherever we are 

and the thought of

 

the trace

.. has already taught us that it is impossible to justify a point of de

parture absolutely.

 

Wherever we are; 

in a text where we already believe ourselves to be” 

(232-33, 

162) .

But in the long run a critic cannot himself present his own vulner

ability. We come back

 

simply to that question of attitude. And to the awareness that both literature 

and 

its criticism

 

must open itself to a decon

structive reading, that criticism does not reveal the “truth” of

 

literature, just as literature reveals no “truth.”

A reading that 

produces 

rather than 

protects. 

That description of decon

struction we have

 

already entertained. Here is another: “. . . the task is .. . to dismantle 

[déconstruire] 

the

 

metaphysical and rhetorical structures which are at work in [the text], not in order to reject or

 

discard them, but to reinscribe them in another way.” (MP 

256, 

WM 13)

How to dismantle these structures? By using a signifier not as a trans

cendental key that will

 

unlock the wav to truth but as a 

bricoleur’s 

or tinker’s tool—a “positive lever” (Pos F 109,

 

Pos E II. 41) . If in the process of deciphering a text in the traditional way we come across a

 

word that seems to harbor an unresolvable contradiction, and by virtue of being 

one 

word is

 

made sometimes to work in one way and sometimes in another and thus is made to point away

 




from the absence of a unified meaning, we shall catch at that word. If a metaphor seems to

 

suppress its implications, we shall catch at that metaphor. We shall follow its adventures

 

through the text and see the text coming undone as a structure of concealment, reveal-ing its

 

self-transgression, its undecidability. It must be emphasized that I am not speaking simply of

 

locating a moment of ambiguity or irony ulti

mately incorporated into the text’s system of

 

unified meaning but rather a moment that genuinely threatens to collapse that system. (It

 

should also be repeated that, although in the 

Grammatology 

Derrida fastens upon the 

word

 

[signifier, metaphor] “supplement” and related 

words 

in Rousseau’s text as his lever, once the

 

critic’s glance is allowed to play upon parts of words and the spacing of a page, the prising-

lever of undecidability may become much more elusive.) At any rate, the relationship between

 

the reinscribed text and the so-called original text is not that of patency and latency, but rather

 

the relationship between two palimpsests. The “origi

nal” text itself is that palimpsest on so-

called “pre”-texts that the critic might or might not be able to disclose and any original

 

inscription would still only be a trace: “Reading then resembles those X-ray pictures which

 

discover, under the epidermis of the last painting, another hidden picture:

((lxxvi))

of the same painter or another painter, no matter, who would himself, for want of materials, or

 

for a new effect, use the substance of an ancient canvas or conserve the fragment of a first

 

sketch” 

(Dis 397)

I have suggested that Derrida implicates himself in the Freudian pro

cedure of attending to the

 

detail of a text. Here let me place, beside the metaphors of palimpsest and x-ray picture,

 

Freud’s own analogy—“though

I know that in these matters analogies never carry us very far”—for the distortion of the

 

psychic text:

[there are] various methods . . . for making [an undesirable] book innocuous. [Derrida would

 

transfer the analogy to the “undesirable” grammatological “threat” inhabiting every text.] One

 

way would be for the offending passages to be thickly crossed through so that they were

 

illegible. In that case they could not be transcribed, and the next copyist of the book would

 

produce a text which was unexceptionable but which had gaps in certain passages, and so

 

might be unintelligible in them. Another way . . . would be . . . to proceed to distort the text.

 

Single words would be left out or replaced by others, and new sen

tences interpolated. 

Best of

 

all, the whole passage would be erased and a new one which said exactly the opposite put in

 

its place.” (GW 

XVI. 81-8z, 

SE 

XXIII. 236; italics are mine)

(It is characteristic, of course, that Freud, who put the psyche under erasure, should, at the

 

same time, use a thoroughly “centric” sentiment to close the passage: “It no longer contained

 

what the author wanted to say.”)

The sense of the horizon of indefinite meaning, with the provisional anchor of the text never

 

given up, has led to a handful of spectacular read

ings. The two most adventurous are “La

 

double séance” (a reading of Mal

larmé’s “Mimique”; 

Dis 

199–317) and “La dissémination” (a

 

reading of Philippe Sollers’ 

Nombres; Dis 

319–407). Those acts of controlled acro

batics are

 

difficult to match. Yet the reading of 

Phaedrus 

in “La pharmacie de Platon” 

(Dis 69–197) 

and

 

of 

The Essay on the Origin of Languages (

2

35-445, X65–

316), although less playful, seem

 

equally impressive.




Speaking of the hymen, Derrida emphasizes the role of the blank spaces of the page in the

 

play of meaning. Analogically, Derrida himself often devotes his attention to the text in its

 

margins, so to speak. He examines the minute particulars of an undecidable moment, nearly

 

imperceptible displacements, that might otherwise escape the reader’s eye. Reading Foucault,

 

he concentrates on three pages out of 

673. 

Reading Rousseau, he chooses a text that is far

 

from “central.” Reading Heidegger, he proceeds to write a note on a note to 

Sein and Zeit.

His method, as he says to Jean-Louis Houdebine, perhaps a little too formulaically, is reversal

 

and displacement. It is not enough “simply to 

neutralize 

the binary oppositions of

 

metaphysics.” We must recognize that, within the familiar philosophical oppositions, there is

 

always “a violent

((lxxvii))

hierarchy. One of the two terms controls the other (axiologically, logically, etc.), holds the

 

superior position. To deconstruct the opposition is first .. . to overthrow 

[renverser] 

the

 

hierarchy.” (Pos F 

57, Pos 

E. I. 

36) 

To fight violence with violence. In the 

Grammatology 

this

 

structural phase would be represented by all those pages where, all apologies to the contrary,

 

the polemical energy seems clearly engaged in putting writing above speech. But in the next

 

phase of deconstruction, this reversal must be displaced, the winning term put under erasure.

 

The critic must make room for “the irruptive emergence of a new ‘concept,’ a concept which

 

no longer allows itself to be understood in terms of the previous regime [system of oppo

-

sitions].” In terms of our book, this would be the aspect that “allows for the dissonant

 

emergence of a writing inside of speech, thus disorganizing all the received order and

 

invading the whole sphere of speech” (Pos E I. 

36).

To locate the promising marginal text, to disclose the undecidable moment, to pry it loose

 

with the positive lever of the signifier; to reverse the resident hierarchy, only to displace it; to

 

dismantle in order to recon

stitute what is always already inscribed. Deconstruction in a

 

nutshell. But take away the assurance of the text’s authority, the critic’s control, and the

 

primacy of meaning, and the possession of this formula does not guar

antee much.

Why should we undo and redo a text at all? Why not assume that words and the author “mean

 

what they say?” It is a complex question. Here let us examine Derrida’s most recent

 

meditation upon the desire of decon

struction.

Derrida acknowledges that the desire of deconstruction may itself be-come a desire to

 

reappropriate the text actively through mastery, to show the text what it “does not know.” And

 

as she deconstructs, all protestations to the contrary, the critic necessarily assumes that she at

 

least, and for the time being, means what she says. Even the declaration of her vulnerability

 

must come, after all, in the controlling language of demonstration and reference. In other

 

words, the critic provisionally forgets that her own text is necessarily self-deconstructed,

 

always already a palimpsest.

The desire of deconstruction has also the opposite allure. Deconstruction seems to offer a way

 

out of the closure of knowledge. By inaugurating the open-ended indefiniteness of textuality

—by thus “placing in the abyss” 

(mettre en abîme), 

as the French expression would literally

 

have it—it shows us the lure of the abyss as freedom. The fall into the abyss of de-

construction inspires us with as much pleasure as fear. We are intoxicated with the prospect of

 

never hitting bottom.




Thus a further deconstruction deconstructs deconstruction, both as the search for a foundation

 

(the critic behaving as if she means what she says in her text), and as the pleasure of the

 

bottomless. The tool for this, as

((lxxviii))

indeed for any deconstruction, is our desire, itself a deconstructive and grammatological

 

structure that forever differs from (we only desire what is not ourselves) and defers (desire is

 

never fulfilled) the text of our selves. Deconstruction can therefore never be a positive

 

science. For we are in a bind, in a “double (read abyssal) bind,” Derrida’s newest nickname

 

for the schizophrenia of the “sous rature.” 81 We 

must 

do a thing 

and 

its oppo

site, and indeed

 

we desire to do both, and so on indefinitely. Deconstruc

tion is a perpetually self-

deconstructing movement that is inhabited by differance. No text is ever 

fully 

deconstructing

 

or deconstructed. Yet the critic provisionally musters the metaphysical resources of criticism

 

and performs what declares itself to be 

one 

(unitary) act of deconstruction. As I point out on

 

pages Ixxxi–lxxxii, the kinship with Freud’s interminable and terminable analysis, involving

 

both subject and analyst, is here not to be ignored.

Derrida is now ready to suggest that, in a certain sense, it is impossible not to deconstruct/be

 

deconstructed.” All texts, whether written in the narrow sense or not, are rehearsing their

 

grammatological structure, self-deconstructing as they constitute themselves. The single act of

 

critical deconstruction is as necessary yet pointless, arrogant yet humble, as all

human gestures. “In the deconstruction of the arche, one does not make a choice” (91, 

62).

These, then, are the lineaments of the Derridean double bind, decon

struction under erasure,

 

the abyss placed in the abyss, active forgetfulness. (Here it may be pointed out that one of the

 

traditional charges against

writing is that it breeds passive forgetfulness (55, 

37

 and passim). In this respect also,

 

deconstruction reinscribes the value of writing.) On page 

xlv 

I bring a charge of “prudence”

 

against Derrida. The new Derrida shows us that this “prudence” is also the greatest “danger,”

 

the will to knowledge as will to ignorance and vice versa. “The ‘knowledge’ of the

 

philosopher places him among the dreamers, for knowledge is a dream. But the phi

lospher

 

‘knowingly’ agrees to dream, to dream of knowledge, agrees to ‘forget’ the lesson of

 

philosophy, only so as to ‘prove’ that lesson. . . . It is a vertiginous movement.”

As 

Glas 

will suggest, this philosophical agreement is the reader/writer’s contract 

(seing) 

with

 

the text. Let me add yet once again that this terri

fying and exhilarating vertigo is not

 

“mystical” or “theological.” The abyss appears when Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, Derrida lift

 

the lid of the most familiar and comforting notions about the possibility of knowledge.

V

Of Grammatology 

is the provisional origin of this Preface. But we have not kept track of the

 

book’s outline. We have considered instead the im-portance of erasure in Derrida; provided

 

some ingredients for the computa-

((lxxix))




tion of the intertextuality between Derrida, and Nietzsche, Heidegger, Freud, Husserl; given

 

some indications of Derrida’s view of Structuralism, especially of the metapsychological

 

practice of Jacques Lacan; commented on the place of “writing” in Derrida’s thought, hinted

 

at the chain of its substitutions, given the recipe for deconstruction. Now that we begin the

 

concluding movements of this repetitive preface, let us make 

Of Gram

matology 

our

 

provisional end.

Derrida situates 

Of Grammatology 

among his own texts thus:

Of 

Grammatology 

can be taken as a long essay articulated in two parts .. . 

between 

which one

 

can stitch in 

L’écriture et la différence. 

The 

Grammatology 

often refers to it. In that case, the

 

interpretation of Rousseau [Part II of Of 

Grammatology] 

would be the twelfth item of the

 

collection. Conversely, one can insert 

Of Grammatology 

in the middle of 

L’écriture et la

 

différence. 

Since six texts of the latter are anterior, in fact and in principle, to the publication ..

 

. in 

Critique, 

of the articles announcing 

Of Grammatology; 

the five last, begin

ning with

 

“Freud and the Scene of Writing” are engaged in the grammatological overture. (Pos F 12–r

 

3)

Although Derrida continues “. . . things don’t let themselves be recon

stituted so simply,” this

 

fable of fragmentation is not without interest. There is a certain stitched-togetherness in 

Of

 

Grammatology

. 

, 

and a decided disjunction between the sweeping, summarizing, theoretical

 

breadth of the first part, and the interpretative, slow, reader’s pace of the second.

Part I is an expanded version of a two-part review of Madeleine V-David’s 

Le débat sur les

 

écritures et l’hiéroglyphe aux xvii° et xviii° siècles, 

André Lerori-Gourhan’s Le 

geste et la

 

parole, 

and the papers of a colloquium en-titled 

L

’

écriture et la psychologie des peuples.82

 

Although the review arti

cles contained most of the material of the entire Part I in their present

 

order, it is in Chapter 3—“Of Grammatology as A Positive Science”—that their mark is most

 

clearly felt. Each of the three books reviewed re

ceives a section of the chapter. The first gives

 

a summary of the moment when grammatology could historically have opened but did not, the

 

moment of the decipherment of non-European scripts. The second investi-gates the possible

 

physiological bases for the differentiation between writ-ing and speech and genetic writing as

 

the determinant of life. The third deals with the implications of varieties of “nonphonetic”

 

writing. One can-not help wondering if all this overt interest in an account of writing in the

 

narrow sense—rather than in the interpretation of texts—is not simply due to the regulating

 

presence of books to be reviewed.

Indeed, in Part I and in the postscript to “Freud and the Scene of Writ-ing,” Derrida speaks

 

most often of re-writing the “history of writing” in

((lxxx))

something suspiciously like the narrow sense—“an immense field where hitherto one has only

 

done preparatory work” 

(ED 

340). “Writing” so envisaged is on the brink of becoming a

 

unique signifier, and Jacques Der

rida’s chief care. In his later work, the theoretical

 

significance of the struc

ture of writing and the grammatological opening remain intact. But he

 

quietly drops the idea of being the authorized grammatological historian of writing in the

 

narrow sense. “Writing” then takes its place on the chain of substitutions. In the

 

Grammatology, 

then, we are at a specific and pre-carious moment in Derrida’s career.




It is fascinating to study the changes and interpolations made in the text of the review articles

 

as they were transformed into the book. (The text is genuinely enriched as the appropriate

 

“difference”-s are changed to “dif

ferance”-s.) Most of the changes make the philosophical

 

ground of the argument stronger. The superb discussion of the proper name (136-37, 

89–90

) is

 

a case in point. So is the long footnote on the psychoanalysis of writing (132-34, 

333–34

), and

 

the insertion of the remarks on the radical alterity necessarily inhabiting the sign. (69, 

47

) So

 

is the cautionary addi

tion on page 125 (

84

). (The original version ran: “It [genetic script] is a

 

liberation which makes for the appearing of the 

grammè 

as such and no doubt makes possible

 

the emergence of ‘writing’ in the narrow sense.” 

[Crit 

II. 46] In the 

Grammatology 

Derrida

 

annuls the possibility of the 

grammè 

ever appearing 

as such. 

He adds the following

 

parenthesis after “as such”: “[that is to say according to a new structure of nonpresence],” and

 

goes on to add the following sentences: “But one cannot think them [the structura

tions of this

 

grammè] 

without the most general concept of the 

grammè. 

That is irreducible and

 

impregnable.”)

From our point of view, what is most interesting is that the theme of “sous rature” is given its

 

development almost entirely in the book rather than in the articles. As I have mentioned

 

above, Derrida never discusses “sous rature” at great length. But in the articles all we have is

 

a 

mention 

of the practice 

(Crit I. 

1029) as it is to be found on page 38 (

23

) of Of 

Gram

-

matology. 

The use of the crossed lines on page 31 (

19

), the discussion of Heidegger’s notion

 

of Being between pages 31 and 38 (

19-23

), the putting of “experience” under erasure on page

 

89 (

6o–61

), of the “past” on page 97 (

66–67

)

, 

and the “originarity of the trace” on page 110

 

(75) 

are all pas-sages only found in the book.

On the other hand, and curiously enough, the argument for historical necessity seems also to

 

have been emphasized as the review articles were turned into the first part of the book. The

 

first tiny change—from “the phoneticization of writing dissimulated its own history while

 

producing it” 

(Crit 

I. 1017) to “the phoneticization of writing 

must 

dissimulate its own history

 

while producing it” (11, 

3

)—sets the tone for all the small

((lxxxi))

but weighty changes that will be made. They are not many, but they are unequivocal. Most of

 

them, naturally enough, are confined to Chapter 1, “The End of the Book and the Beginning

 

of Writing.” The paragraph beginning “these disguises are not historical contingencies” (17,

 

7

; 

the article had only the first two sentences) is a representative example. The repression of

 

writing, and its recognition today, are seen as historically necessary events. In a text where he

 

elaborately launches a theory against teleological patternings of history and thought, where he

 

delivers the notion of the play of necessity and contingency, why does Derrida fabri

cate so

 

strong an argument for historical necessity? Why is the opening chapter—“The End of the

 

Book and the Beginning of Writing”—full of a slightly embarrassing messianic promise? If

 

we really do not believe in “epistemological cut-off points,” or in the possibility of stepping

 

out of the metaphysical enclosure by simply deciding to, or in the linearity of time, then with

 

what seriousness can we declare a different “world to come,” a world where the “values of

 

sign, speech, and writing,” will be made to tremble? (14, 

5

) How 

reconcile ourselves with this

 

break between the world of the past and the world of the future? It seems an empiricist be

-

trayal of the structure of difference and postponement, and any decon

structive reading of

 

Derrida will have to take this into account.




(We have seen that Derrida will not call grammatology a psychoanalysis of logocentrism. On

 

page 20 [

9–10

] of the 

Grammatology, 

there is the merest hint of a psychoanalytical patterning

 

of the history of writing that Derrida does not pursue: “This situation [the role of writing in

 

the naming of the human element] has always already been announced. Why is it today in the

 

process of making itself recognized 

as such 

and 

after the fact [après coup]”? 

Making itself

 

recognized 

as such. 

Derrida makes an attempt on that page at answering that part of the

 

question in terms of the development in ways and means of information retrieval,

 

phonography, and cybernetics, all join-ing forces with anthropology and the history of writing

—the sciences of man. But elsewhere in the book, as we have seen, he emphasizes that the

 

situation can never be recognized 

as such, 

that we must surrender ourselves to being inscribed

 

within the chain of future deconstructions and decipher

ings. It is therefore the 

après coup 

that

 

seems more interesting here. That is the French word for Freud’s 

“Nachträglichkeit”—

translated into English as “deferred action.” As we recall, at the time that a stimulus is

 

received, it goes 

either 

into the perceptual system 

or 

into the Unconscious and produces a

 

permanent trace. That particular trace might be energized into conscious

ness (as Freud

 

reminds us over and over again, this topographical language must be used with caution) long

 

afterward—nachträglich, après coup. 

But it never comes up 

as such; 

in fact, as Derrida

 

argues, following Freud, the trace 

[die Bahnung] 

itself is primary. There is no “thing” there in

 

the

((lxxxii))

Unconscious but simply the possibility for this particular path to be ener

gized. When the track

 

is opened up, and we have the 

après coup 

perception of the originary trace, the impulse in the

 

Unconscious is not exhausted. Unconscious impulses are indestructible. Now before the

 

remarks about theoretical mathematics, information retrieval 

et alia 

on page 20 [9–10],

 

Derrida slips in, immediately after the sentences we are examining, the fol-lowing words:

 

“This question would call forth an interminable analysis.” “Interminable analysis.” The words

 

themselves recall Freud’s late essay “Analysis Terminable and Interminable.”83 The impulses

 

in the Uncon

scious are indestructible, 

après coup 

they come up into consciousness in-

terminably, and thus constitute the subject. A neurosis can never be analyzed to the full—the

 

analysis would in fact, be interminable, if the practical analyst did not terminate it. Is the trace

 

of the repression of writ-ing in some indeterminate historical Unconscious “coming up” to our

 

con

sciousness at the present historical moment, 

après coup? 

Derrida himself is clearly not

 

willing to assume the responsibility for what might seem a psychoanalytic schema. This again

 

is an undertaking for a future decon

structor. Yet there is, no doubt, a strong sympathy between

 

Freud’s notion of the theoretical impossibility of a full analysis and Derrida’s polemic of the

 

need for the perpetual renewal of the grammatological or deconstruc

tive undertaking. In fact,

 

that is what all of Derrida’s work on “writing” has presented—although it seems to be

 

receiving articulation today, varia

tions of previous articulations have existed throughout

 

history and the complex will have to be confronted perpetually as the language of con

-

frontation, obeying our will to power, adapts to and is retrieved by logo-centrism, or, as Freud

 

would say, with a little help from Heidegger, as “the ego treats [recovery med kryss] itself as a

 

new [danger med kryss] [

SE 

XXIII. 238; erasures mine] It seems quite

 

plausible, then, to ask: if “the Freudian discourse—its syntax or . . . its work” were delivered

 

from “his necessarily metaphysical and traditional concepts” [

ED 

294], would one be able to

decipher a psychoanalytic schema in the obstinate historical pattern of 

Of Grammatology? )




There is also the shadow of a geographical pattern that falls upon the first part of the book.

 

The relationship between logocentrism and ethno

centrism is indirectly invoked in the very

 

first sentence of the “Exergue.” Yet, paradoxically, and almost by a reverse ethnocentrism,

 

Derrida insists that logocentrism is a property of the 

West. 

He does this so frequently that a

 

quotation would be superfluous. Although something of the Chinese prejudice of the West is

 

discussed in Part I, the 

East is 

never seriously studied or deconstructed in the Derridean text.

 

Why then must it remain, recalling Hegel and Nietzsche in their most cartological humors, as

 

the name of the limits of the text’s knowledge?

((lxxxiii))

The discussion of Lévi-Strauss in Part II, the only genuinely polemical and perhaps the least

 

formally awkward section of the book, first appeared in 1966, as part of an issue on Lévi-

Strauss of the 

Cahiers pour l’analyse 

(IV, September–October, 1966).

Derrida chooses Lévi-Strauss as his subject because, “at once conserving and annulling

 

inherited conceptual oppositions, this thought, like Saus

sure’s, stands on a borderline:

 

sometimes within an uncriticized con

ceptuality, sometimes putting a strain on the boundaries,

 

and working toward deconstruction” (154, 105). And he takes Lévi-Strauss to task for

 

slackness of method, for sentimental ethnocentrism, for an oversimplified reading of

 

Rousseau. He criticizes Lévi-Strauss for conceiving of writing only in the narrow sense, for

 

seeing it as a scapegoat for all the exploitative evils of “civilization,” and for conceiving of

 

the violent Nambikwara as an innocent community “without writing.” If the end of Part I

 

seems too con

cerned with writing in the narrow sense, these chapters redeem themselves in

 

that respect. For in them Derrida repeatedly moves us from writing in the narrow sense to

 

writing in general—through such “systematic” state

ments as: “the genealogical relation and

 

social classification are the stitched seam of arche-writing, condition of the (so-called oral)

 

language, and of writing in the colloquial sense” (182, 125) to such “poetic” ones as: “the

 

Silva 

[forest] is savage, the 

via rupta 

[path cut through] is written . . . it is difficult to imagine

 

that access to the possibility of road maps is not access to writing” (158, 108) .

Perhaps the most interesting reason given for the impossibility of a community without

 

writing is that the bestowing of the proper name, something no society can avoid, is itself

 

inhabited by the structure of writing. For the phrase “proper name” signifies a classification,

 

an institu

tion carrying the trace of history, into which a certain sort of sign is made to fit. Thus

 

the proper name, as soon as it is understood as such, is no longer fully unique and proper to

 

the holder. The proper name is always already common by virtue of belonging to the category

 

“proper.” It is al-ways already under erasure: “When within 

consciousness, 

the name is 

called

 

proper, it is already classified and is obliterated in 

being named. 

It is already no more than 

a

 

so-called 

proper name” (161, 109). Lévi-Strauss knows this, as his discussion of proper

 

names in 

The Savage Mind (pp. 

226f., Eng. pp. 172f.) demonstrates. But, having nothing but a

 

restricted concept of writing, he cannot relate the proper name to writing: “The essence or the

 

energy of the 

graphein . . . [is] 

the originary effacement of the proper name” (159, 108) .

This argument does not only serve to undo the anthropoloigst’s re-verse ethnocentrism toward

 

an “innocent community without writing.” It points to the presence of writing in general in all

 

the ramifications of the

((lxxxiv))




“

proper —me own, the distinguishing characteristic, the literal, the ex

clusively clean. It is so

 

pervasive a Derridean theme that I can do no more than mention it here. In a way, Derrida’s

 

chief concern might be summarized thus: to problematize the proper name and proper (literal)

 

mean-ing, the proper in general.

The argument points also to the theme of the play of desire around the proper name: The

 

narcissistic desire to make one’s own “proper” name “common,” to make it enter and be at

 

one with the body of the mother-tongue; and, at the same time, the oedipal desire to preserve

 

one’s proper name, to see it as the analogon of the 

name 

of the father. Much of Der

rida’s

 

recent work meditates on this play. I shall quote the beginning of 

Glas, 

where Hegel (the

 

“proper” name) is invoked as the eagle (the “common” name) that the French pronunciation

 

of his name—“aigle”—turns him into:

Who, he?

His name is so strange. From the eagle he draws his imperial or historical power. Those who

 

still pronounce it as French, and there are those, are silly only to a certain point: the restitution

 

. . . of the magisterial cold . . . of the eagle caught in ice and frost [gel]. Let the emblemished

 

philosopher be thus con

gealed. (p. 7)

Pages 145 to 151 (

97–10

2) are a theoretical “justification” of what Derrida will come to call

 

“intertextuality:” the interweaving of different texts (literally “web”-s) in an act of criticism

 

that refuses to think of “influence” or “interrelationship” as simple historical phenomena.

 

Inter

textuality becomes the most striking conceptual and typographical signa-ture in 

Glas.

 

Pages 226 to 234 (

157–64

)—“The Exorbitant: Question of Method”—are, as I have

 

suggested, a simple and moving exposition of the method of deconstruction as understood by

 

the early Derrida.

Rousseau’s place in Derrida’s text is most importantly marked by the former’s use of the word

 

“supplement”: “Writing will appear to me more and more,” Derrida writes, “as another name

 

for this structure of sup

plementarity. . . . It does not suffice to say that Rousseau thinks the

 

supplement without thinking it, that he does not match his saying and his meaning, his

 

descriptions and his declarations. . . . Using the word and describing the thing, Rousseau in a

 

way displaces and deforms the sign ‘supplement,’ the unity of the signifier and the signified. .

 

. . But these displacements and deformations are regulated by the contradictory unity —itself

 

supplementary—of a desire” (348, 

245). 

Of the issue of supple

mentarity itself, abundantly

 

developed by Derrida in this book, there is no need to speak. Of more interest to me is the

 

question, how does the word “supplement” signify Rousseau’s desire? Before I attempt to

 

gauge

((lxxxv))

Derrida’s enigmatic answer to this question, I shall digress and point at the rather endearing

 

conservatism of Chapter 3, Section I: “The Placé of the Essay.”

There is a certain mark of superior academic scholarship in that section that seems out of joint

 

with the theoretical spirit of the book. Here the philosopher who has written “The outside [is

 

med kryss] the inside” in Part I, speaks with perfect seriousness about internal and external

 

evidence, and the thinker of “intertextuality” concerns himself with the relative dating of 

The

 

Essay on the Origin of Languages 

and 

The Discourse on Inequality. 

This reader is happy that

 




those marks of traditional scholarship were not unstitched. It is engrossing to watch the bold

 

argument operating in the service of a conventional debate. For the burden of the proof lies on

 

“the economy of pity”—the supplementarity of pity in both Rousseau texts—and intertextual

 

practice does emerge as the two texts are woven together: “From one [text] to the other, an

 

emphasis is displaced, a continuous slid-ing is in operation. . . . The Discourse wants to 

mark

 

the beginning... . 

The Essay would make us 

sense the beginnings. . . . 

It seizes man . . . in that

 

subtle transition from origin to genesis. . . . The description of pure nature in the 

Discourse

 

made room within itself for such a transition. As always, it is the unseizable limit of the

 

almost” 

(358, 

253

). I do not believe that Derrida ever again devotes himself to this sort of

 

textual scholarship. Here, too, the reading of 

Of Grammatology 

gives us the taste of a rather

 

special early Derrida, the young scholar transforming the ground rules of scholarship.

The book ends with Rousseau’s dream, the supplementary desire that I refer to above. Such an

 

ending is a characteristic Derrida touch, criticism giving up the idiom of expository mastery in

 

the end and taking on the idiom of the fabulist. “La pharmacie de Platon” ends with the scene

 

of Plato in his pharmacy, “White Mythology” with the heliotrope stone. Examples can be

 

multiplied.

Rousseau, that famous masturbator, has a philosophical wet dream: “Rousseau’s dream

 

consisted of making the supplement enter metaphysics by force” (444, 

315) .

But is not that force precisely the energy of Derrida’s own project?

Is this not precisely the trick of writing, that dream-cum-truth, that breaches the metaphysical

 

closure with an intrinsic yet supplementary violence? At the end of Derrida’s book on

 

Rousseau, Rousseau is set dreaming of Derrida. Perhaps the book does end with its author’s

 

signature.

It is customary at this point to say a few words about the problem of translation. Derrida’s text

 

certainly offers its share of “untranslatable” words. I have had my battles with “exergue” and

 

“propre.” 84 My special worry is

((lxxxvi))

“

entamer.” As we have seen, it is an important word in Derrida’s vocabu

lary. It means both to

 

break into and to begin. I have made do with “broach” or “breach,” with the somewhat

 

fanciful confidence that the shadow-word “breach” or “broach” will declare itself through it.

 

With “entamer” as well as with other words and expressions, I have included the original in

 

parenthesis whenever the wording and syntax of the French seemed to carry a special charge.

 

To an extent, this particular problem informs the entire text. Denying the uniqueness of words,

 

their substan

tiality, their transferability, their repeatability, 

Of Grammatology 

denies the

 

possibility of translation. Not so paradoxically perhaps, each twist of phrase becomes at the

 

same time “significant” and playful when language is manipulated for the purpose of putting

 

signification into question, for deconstructing the binary opposition “signifier-signified.” That

 

playfulness I fear I have not been able remotely to capture. Even so simple a word as “de”

 

carries a touch of play—hinting at both “of” and “from.” (I have once resorted to “from/of,”

 

where the playfulness seemed to ask for special recognition [page 269].) But that sort of

 

heavy-handedness cannot punctu

ate an entire text where “penser” (to think) carries within

 




itself and points at “panser” (to dress a wound); for does not thinking seek forever to clamp a

 

dressing over the gaping and violent wound of the impossi

bility of thought? The translation of

 

the title, suggesting “a piece of” as well as “about,” I have retained against expert counsel.

I began this preface by informing my readers that Derrida’s theory ad

mitted—as it denied—a

 

preface by questioning the absolute repeatability of the text. It is now time to acknowledge

 

that his theory would likewise admit—as it denies—translation, by questioning the absolute

 

privilege of the original. Any act of reading is besieged and delivered by the precarious

ness of

 

intertextuality. And translation is, after all, one version of inter

textuality.85 If there are no

 

unique words, if, as soon as a privileged con

cept-word emerges, it must be given over to the

 

chain of substitutions and to the “common language,” why should that act of substitution that

 

is translation be suspect? If the proper name or sovereign status of the author is as much a

 

barrier as a right of way, why should the translator’s position be secondary? It must now be

 

evident that, desiring to conserve the “original” 

(De la grammatologie) 

and seduced by the

 

freedom of the absence of a sovereign text (not only is there no 

Of Grammatology 

before

 

mine, but there have been as many translations of the text as readings, the text is infinitely

 

translatable), translation itself is in a double bind (see pages 

lxxvii–lxxviii

).

And, from quite another point of view, most practically and rigorously speaking, both Derrida

 

and I being very roughly bilingual—his English a cut above my French—where does French

 

end and English begin?

((lxxxvii))

I shall not launch my philosophy of translation here. Instead I give you a glimpse of

 

Derrida’s:

Within the limits of its possibility, or its 

apparent 

possibility, translation prac

tices the

 

difference between signified and signifier. But, if this difference is never pure, translation is

 

even less so, and a notion of 

transformation 

must be substituted for the notion of translation: a

 

regulated transformation of one language by another, of one text by another. We shall not have

 

and never have had to deal with some “transfer” of pure signifieds that the signifying instru

-

ment—or “vehicle”—would leave virgin and intact, from one language to another, or within

 

one and the same language. (Pos 31)

“

From one language to another, 

or 

within one and the same language.” Translation is a

 

version of the intertexuality that comes to bear also within the “same” language. Ergo .. .

Heidegger’s deconstructive (or “destructive”) method is often based on consideration of how

 

the so-called content of philosophy is affected by the exigencies of translation. Derrida writes

 

of this in “La différance” and “Ousia et grammè.” 

(MP 3–29, SP 

129-60; 

MP 

31–78) In the

 

latter example there is a double play: Heidegger laments the loss for philosophy when the lone

 

latin “presence” was pressed into service to translate the many nuanced Greek words

 

signifying philosophical shadings of the idea of presence. Derrida engages in the parallel

 

lament—how translate the many nuanced Heideggerian German words signifying

 

philosophical shad

ings of the idea of presence through the lone Romance “présence?” Der-

rida goes on to use the business of “mistranslations” as an effective decon

structive lever of his

 

own. The most sustained example is “La pharmacie de Platon,” where he appropriately asks:

 

why have translators obliterated the word 

“pharmakon” 

by providing a collection of different

 

words as its translated substitute?




And all said and done, that is the sort of reader I would hope for. A reader who would fasten

 

upon my mistranslations, and with that leyerage deconstruct Derrida’s text beyond what

 

Derrida as controlling subject has directed in it.

Preface

The first part of this book, “Writing before the Letter,” 1 sketches in broad outlines a

 

theoretical matrix. It indicates certain significant his

torical moments, and proposes certain

 

critical concepts.

These critical concepts are put to the test in the second part, “Nature, Culture, Writing.” This

 

is the moment, as it were, of the example, although strictly speaking, that notion is not

 

acceptable within my argument. I have tried, to defend, patiently and at length, the choice of

 

these examples (as I have called them for the sake of convenience) and the necessity for their

 

presentation. It is a question of a reading of what may perhaps be called the “age” of

 

Rousseau. A reading merely outlined; considering the need for such an analysis, the,difficulty

 

of the problems, and the nature of my project, I have felt justified in selecting a short and

 

little-known text, the Essay 

on the Origin of Languages

.* I shall have to explain the

 

privileged place I give to that work. There is yet another reason why my reading might be

 

incomplete: although I have no ambition to illustrate a new method, I have attempted to

 

produce, often embarrassing myself in the process, the problems of critical reading. These

 

problems are at all times related to the guiding intention of this book. My interpretation of

 

Rousseau’s text follows implicitly the propositions ventured in Part I; propositions that

 

demand that reading should free itself, at least in its axis, from the classical cate

gories of

 

history—not only from the categories of the history of ideas and the history of literature but

 

also, and perhaps above all, from the categories of the history of philosophy.

It goes without saying that around that axis I have had to respect classical norms, or at least I

 

have attempted to respect them. Although the word “age” or “epoch” can be given more than

 

these determinations, I should mention that I have concerned myself with 

a structural figure

 

as much as a 

historical totality. 

I have attempted to relate these two seem

ingly necessary

 

approaches, thus repeating the question of the text, its historical status, its proper time and

 

space. The age already in the 

past is 

in fact constituted in every respect as 

a text, 

in a sense of

 

these words that I

Exergue

1.The one who will shine in the science of writing will shine like the sun. A scribe (EP, p. 87)

O Samas (sun-god), by your light you scan the totality of lands as if they were cuneiform

 

signs (ibid.) .

2.These three ways of writing correspond almost exactly to three different stages according to

 

which one can consider men gathered into a nation. The depicting of objects is appropriate to

 

a savage people; signs of words and of propositions, to a barbaric people; and the alphabet to

 

civilized people. J.-J. Rousseau, Essai 

sur l’origine des langues.

3.Alphabetic script is in itself and for itself the most intelligent. Hegel, Enzyklopädie.

This triple exergue is intended not only to focus attention on the 

ethno

centrism 

which,

 

everywhere and always, had controlled the concept of writ-ing. Nor merely to focus attention

 

on what I shall call 

logocentrism: 

the metaphysics of phonetic writing (for example, of the

 

alphabet) which was fundamentally—for enigmatic yet essential reasons that are inaccessible

 

to a simple historical relativism—nothing but the most original and powerful ethnocentrism,

 

in the process of imposing itself upon the world, controlling in one and the same 

order:

1.

the concept of

 

writing 

in a world where the phoneticization of writing must dissimulate its

 

own history as it is produced;




2.

the history of 

(the only) 

metaphysics, 

which has, in spite of all dif

ferences, not only from

 

Plato to Hegel (even including Leibniz) but also, beyond these apparent limits, from the pre-

Socratics to Heidegger, always assigned the origin of truth in general to the logos: the history

 

of truth, of the truth of truth, has always been—except for a metaphysical diversion that we

 

shall have to explain—the debasement of writing, and its repression outside “full” speech.

3.

the concept of science 

or the scientificity of science—what has always been determined as

 

logic—a 

concept that has always been a philosophical concept, even if the practice of science

 

has constantly challenged its im

perialism of the logos, by invoking, for example, from the

 

beginning and ever increasingly, nonphonetic writing. No doubt this subversion has always

 

been contained within a system of direct address 

[système allo

cutoire] 

which gave birth to the

 

project of science and to the conventions of all nonphonetic characteristics. 1 It could not

 

have been otherwise. None-

((4))

theless, it is a peculiarity of our epoch that, at the moment when the pho

neticization of writing

—the historical origin and structural possibility of philosophy as of science, the condition of

 

the 

epistémè—begins 

to lay hold on world culture, 2 science, in its advancements, can no

 

longer be satisfied with it. This inadequation had always already begun to make its presence

 

felt. But today something lets it appear as such, allows it a kind of takeover without our being

 

able to translate this novelty into clear cut notions of mutation, explicitation, accumulation,

 

revolution, or tradition. These values belong no doubt to the system whose dislocation is

 

today presented as such, they describe the styles of an historical movement which was

 

meaningful—like the concept of history itself—only within a logocentric epoch.

By alluding to a science of writing reined in by metaphor, metaphysics, and theology, 3 this

 

exergue must not only announce that the science of 

writing—grammatology 

4—

shows 

signs

 

of liberation all over the world, as a result of decisive efforts. These efforts are necessarily

 

discreet, dispersed, almost imperceptible; that is a quality of their meaning and of the milieu

 

within which they produce their operation. I would like to suggest above all that, however

 

fecund and necessary the undertaking might be, and even if, given the most favorable

 

hypothesis, it did overcome all technical and epistemological obstacles as well as all the

 

theological and meta-physical impediments that have limited it hitherto, such a science of

 

writing runs the risk of never being established as such and with that name. Of never being

 

able to define the unity of its project or its object. Of not being able either to write its

 

discourse on method or to describe the limits of its field. For essential reasons: the unity of all

 

that allows itself to be attempted today through the most diverse concepts of science and of

 

writing, is, in principle, more or less covertly yet always, determined by an historico-

metaphysical epoch of which we merely glimpse the 

closure. 

I do not say the 

end. 

The idea of

 

science and the idea of writing—therefore also of the science of writing—is meaningful for us

 

only in terms of an origin and within a world to which a certain concept of the sign (later I

 

shall call it 

the 

concept of sign) and a certain concept of the relationships between speech and

 

writing, have 

already 

been assigned. A most determined relationship, in spite of its privilege,

 

its necessity, and the field of vision that it has controlled for a few millennia, especially in the

 

West, to the point of being now able to produce its own dislocation and itself proclaim its

 

limits.

Perhaps patient meditation and painstaking investigation on and around what is still

 

provisionally called writing, far from falling short of a science of writing or of hastily

 




dismissing it by some obscurantist reaction, letting it rather develop its positivity as far as

 

possible, are the wanderings of a way of thinking that is faithful and attentive to the

 

ineluctable world of the future which proclaims itself at present, beyond the closure of

 

knowledge.

((5))

The future can only be anticipated in the form of an absolute danger. It is that which breaks

 

absolutely with constituted normality and can only be proclaimed, 

presented, 

as a sort of

 

monstrosity. For that future world and for that within it which will have put into question the

 

values of sign, word, and writing, for that which guides our future anterior, there is as yet no

 

exergue.

1. The End of the Book and the Beginning of Writing

Socrates, he who does not write

*—Nietzsche

However the topic is considered, the 

problem of language 

has never been simply one problem

 

among others. But never as much as at present has it invaded, 

as such, 

the global horizon of

 

the most diverse researches and the most heterogeneous discourses, diverse and

 

heterogeneous in their intention, method, and ideology. The devaluation of the word

 

“language” itself, and how, in the very hold it has upon us, it betrays a loose vocabulary, the

 

temptation of a cheap seduction, the passive yielding to fashion, the consciousness of the

 

avant-garde, in other words—ignorance—are evidences of this effect. This inflation of the

 

sign “language” is the inflation of the sign itself, absolute inflation, inflation itself. Yet, by one

 

of its aspects or shadows, it is itself still a sign: this crisis is also a symptom. It indicates, as if

 

in spite of itself, that a historico-metaphvsical epoch 

must 

finally de-termine as language the

 

totality of its problematic horizon. It must do so not only because all that desire had wished to

 

wrest from the play of lan

guage finds itself recaptured within that play but also because, for

 

the same reason, language itself is menaced in its very life, helpless, adrift in the threat of

 

limitlessness, brought back to its own finitude at the very moment when its limits seem to

 

disappear, when it ceases to be self-assured, contained, and 

guaranteed 

by the infinite

 

signified which seemed to exceed it.

The Program

By a slow movement whose necessity is hardly perceptible, everything that for at least some

 

twenty centuries tended toward and finally suc

ceeded in being gathered under the name of

 

language is beginning to let itself be transferred to, or at least summarized under, the name of

 

writing. By a hardly perceptible necessity, it seems as though the concept of writing

•

no longer indicating a particular, derivative, auxiliary form of language in general

 

(whether understood as communication, relation, expression, sig

nification, constitution of

 

meaning or thought, etc.), no longer designating the exterior surface, the insubstantial double

 

of a major signifier, 

the signifier of the signifier—is 

beginning to go beyond the extension of

 

lan

guage. In all senses of the word, writing thus 

comprehends 

language. Not that the word

 

“writing” has ceased to designate the signifier of the sig

nifier, but it appears, strange as it may

 

seem, that “signifier of the signifier” no longer defines accidental doubling and fallen

 

secondarity. “Signifier of the signifier” describes on the contrary the movement of language:

 

in its origin, to be sure, but one can already suspect that an origin whose struc

ture can be

 

expressed as “signifier of the signifier” conceals and erases itself in its own production. There

 

the signified always already functions as a signifier. The secondarity that it seemed possible to

 

ascribe to writing alone affects all signifieds in general, affects them always already, the

 

moment they 

enter the game. 

There is not a single signified that escapes, even if recaptured,

 

the play of signifying references that constitute language. The advent of writing is the advent

 

of this play; today such a play is coming into its own, effacing the limit starting from which

 

one had thought to regulate the circulation of signs, drawing along with it all the reassuring

 

signifieds, reducing all the strongholds, all the out-of-bounds shelters that watched over the

 

field of language. This, strictly speaking, amounts to destroying the concept of “sign” and its

 

entire logic. Undoubtedly it is not by chance that this 

overwhelming 

supervenes at the

 

moment when the extension of the concept of language effaces all its limits. We shall see that

 

this overwhelming and this effacement have the same meaning, are one and the same

 

phenomenon. It is as if the Western concept of language (in terms of what, beyond its

 

plurivocity and beyond the strict and problematic opposition of speech 

[parole] 

and language

 

[langue], 

attaches it 

in general 

to phonematic or glossematic production, to language, to

 

voice, to hearing, to sound and breadth, to speech) were revealed today as the guise or

 

disguise of a primary writing: 1 more fundamental than that which, before this conversion,

 

passed for the simple “supplement to the spoken word” (Rousseau). Either writing was never

 

a simple “supplement,” or it is urgently necessary to construct a new logic of the

 

“supplement.” It is this urgency which will guide us further in reading Rousseau.

These disguises are not historical contingencies that one might admire or regret. Their

 

movement was absolutely necessary, with a necessity which cannot be judged by any other

 

tribunal. The privilege of the 

phone 

does not depend upon a choice that could have been

 

avoided. It responds to a moment of 

economy 

(let us say of the “life” of “history” or of “being

 

as self-relationship”). The system of “hearing (understanding) -oneself-speak” through the

 

phonic substance—which 

presents itself 

as the nonexterior,

((8))

nonmundane, therefore nonempirical or noncontingent signifier—has neces

sarily dominated

 

the history of the world during an entire epoch, and has even produced the idea of the world,

 

the idea of world-origin, that arises from the difference between the worldly and the non-

worldly, the outside and the inside, ideality and nonideality, universal and nonuniversal, trans

-

cendental and empirical, etc 

.2

With an irregular and essentially precarious success, this movement would apparently have

 

tended, as toward its 

telos, 

to confine writing to a secondary and instrumental function:

 

translator of a full speech that was fully 

present 

(present to itself, to its signified, to the other,

 




the very condition of the theme of presence in general), technics in the service of language,

 

spokes-man, 

interpreter of an originary speech itself shielded from interpretation.

Technics in the service of language: I am not invoking a general essence of technics which

 

would be already familiar to us and would help us in 

understanding 

the narrow and

 

historically determined concept of writing as an example. I believe on the contrary that a

 

certain sort of question about the meaning and origin of writing precedes, or at least merges

 

with, a cer

tain type of question about the meaning and origin of technics. That is why the

 

notion of technique can never simply clarify the notion of writing.

It is therefore as if what we call language could have been in its origin and in its end only a

 

moment, an essential but determined mode, a phe

nomenon, an aspect, a species of writing.

 

And as if it had succeeded in making us forget this, and 

in wilfully misleading us, 

only in the

 

course of an adventure: as that adventure itself. All in all a short enough adventure. It merges

 

with the history that has associated technics and logocentric metaphysics for nearly three

 

millennia. And it now seems to be approach-ing what is really its own 

exhaustion; 

under the

 

circumstances—and this is no more than one example among others—of this death of the

 

civilization of the book, of which so much is said and which manifests itself particu

larly

 

through a convulsive proliferation of libraries. All appearances to the contrary, this death of

 

the book undoubtedly announces (and in a certain sense always has announced) nothing but a

 

death of speech (of a 

so-called 

full speech) and a new mutation in the history of writing, in

 

history as writing. Announces it at a distance of a few centuries. It is on that scale that we

 

must reckon it here, being careful not to neglect the quality of a very heterogeneous historical

 

duration: the acceleration is such, and such its qualitative meaning, that one would be equally

 

wrong in making a careful evaluation according to past rhythms. “Death of speech” is of

 

course a metaphor here: before we speak of disappearance, we must think of a new situation

 

for speech, of its subordination within a structure of which it will no longer be the archon.

To affirm in this way that the concept of writing exceeds and compre

hends that of language,

 

presupposes of course a certain definition of Ian-

((9))

guage and of writing. If we do not attempt to justify it, we shall be giving in to the movement

 

of inflation that we have just mentioned, which has also taken over the word “writing,” and

 

that not fortuitously. For some time now, as a matter of fact, here and there, by a gesture and

 

for motives that are profoundly necessary, whose degradation is easier to denounce than it is

 

to disclose their origin, one says “language” for action, movement, thought, reflection,

 

consciousness, unconsciousness, experience, affectivity, etc. Now we tend to say “writing” for

 

all that and more: to designate not only the physical gestures of literal pictographic or

 

ideographic inscription, but also the totality of what makes it possible; and also, beyond the

 

signifying face, the signified face itself. And thus we say “writing” for all that gives rise to an

 

inscription in general, whether it is literal or not and even if what it distributes in space is

 

alien to the order of the voice: cinematography, choreography, of course, but also pictorial,

 

musical, sculptural “writing.” One might also speak of athletic writing, and with even greater

 

certainty of military or political writing in view of the techniques that govern those domains

 

today. All this to describe not only the system of notation sec

ondarily connected with these

 

activities but the essence and the content of these activities themselves. It is also in this sense

 

that the contemporary biologist speaks of writing and 

pro-gram 

in relation to the most

 

elementary processes of information within the living cell. And, finally, whether it has

 




essential limits or not, the entire field covered by the cybernetic 

program 

will be the field of

 

writing. If the theory of cybernetics is by itself to oust all metaphysical concepts—including

 

the concepts of soul, of life, of value, of choice, of memory—which until recently served to

 

separate the machine from man, 3 it must conserve the notion of writing, trace, grammè

 

[written mark], or grapheme, until its own historico-metaphysical character is also exposed.

 

Even before being determined as human (with all the distinctive characteristics that have

 

always been attributed to man and the entire system of significations that they imply) or

 

nonhuman, the 

grammè—or 

the grapheme—would thus name the element. An element

 

without sim

plicity. An element, whether it is understood as the medium or as the irreducible

 

atom, of the arche-synthesis in general, of what one must forbid oneself to define within the

 

system of oppositions of metaphysics, of what consequently one should not even call

 

experience 

in general, that is to say the origin of 

meaning 

in general.

This situation has always already been announced. Why is it today in the process of making

 

itself known 

as such 

and 

after the fact? 

This question would call forth an interminable

 

analysis. Let us simply choose some points of departure in order to introduce the limited

 

remarks to which I shall confine myself. I have already alluded to 

theoretical 

mathematics; its

 

writ

ing—whether understood as a sensible 

graphie 

[manner of writing] (and that already

 

presupposes an identity, therefore an ideality, of its form, which

((10))

in principle renders absurd the so easily admitted notion of the “sensible signifier”), or

 

understood as the ideal synthesis of signifieds or a trace operative on another level, or whether

 

it is understood, more profoundly, as the 

passage 

of the one to the other—has never been

 

absolutely linked with a phonetic production. Within cultures practicing so-called phonetic

 

writ-ing, mathematics is not just an enclave. That is mentioned by all historians of writing;

 

they recall at the same time the imperfections of alphabetic writing, which passed for so long

 

as the most convenient and “the most intelligent”4 writing. This enclave is also the place

 

where the practice of scientific language challenges intrinsically and with increasing

 

profundity the ideal of phonetic writing and all its implicit metaphysics (metaphysics 

itself ),

 

particularly, that is, the philosophical idea of the 

epistémè; 

also of 

istoria, a 

concept

 

profoundly related to it in spite of the dissociation or opposition which has distinguished one

 

from the other during one phase of their common progress. History and knowledge, 

istoria

 

and 

epistémè 

have always been determined (and not only etymologically or philo

sophically)

 

as detours 

for the purpose of 

the reappropriaton of presence.

But beyond theoretical mathematics, the development of the 

practical methods 

of information

 

retrieval extends the possibilities of the “message” vastly, to the point where it is no longer the

 

“written” translation of a language, the transporting of a signified which could remain spoken

 

in its integrity. It goes hand in hand with an extension of phonography and of all the means of

 

conserving the spoken language, of making it function without the presence of the speaking

 

subject. This development, coupled with that of anthropology and of the history of writing,

 

teaches us that phonetic writing, the medium of the great metaphysical, scientific, techni

cal,

 

and economic adventure of the West, is limited in space and time and limits itself even as it is

 

in the process of imposing its laws upon the cultural areas that had escaped it. But this

 

nonfortuitous conjunction of cybernetics and the “human sciences” of writing leads to a more

 

profound reversal.

The Signifier and Truth




The “rationality”—but perhaps that word should be abandoned for reasons that will appear at

 

the end of this sentence—which govems a writ-ing thus enlarged and radicalized, no longer

 

issues from a logos. Further, it inaugurates the destruction, not the demolition but the de-

sedimentation, the de-construction, of all the significations that have their source in that of the

 

logos. Particularly the signification of 

truth. 

All the metaphysical determinations of truth, and

 

even the one beyond metaphysical onto-theology that Heidegger reminds us of, are more or

 

less immediately inseparable from the instance of the logos, or of a reason thought within the

 

lineage of the logos, in whatever sense it is understood: in the pre-

((11))

Socratic or the philosophical sense, in the sense of God’s infinite under-standing or in the

 

anthropological sense, in the pre-Hegelian or the post-Hegelian sense. Within this logos, the

 

original and essential link to the 

phonè 

has never been broken. It would be easy to

 

demonstrate this and I shall attempt such a demonstration later. As has been more or less im

-

plicitly determined, the essence of the 

phonè 

would be immediately proxi

mate to that which

 

within “thought” as logos relates to “meaning,” pro

duces it, re9eives it, speaks it, “composes”

 

it. If, for Aristotle, for example, “spoken words (ta en to phone) are the symbols of mental

 

experience (pathemata tes psyches) and written words are the symbols of spoken words” 

(De

 

interpretatione, 

1, 16a 3) it is because the voice, producer of 

the first symbols, 

has a

 

relationship of essential and immediate proximity with the mind. Producer of the first

 

signifier, it is not just a simple signifier among others. It signifies “mental experiences” which

 

themselves reflect or mirror things by natural resemblance. Between being and mind, things

 

and feelings, there would be a relationship of translation or natural sig

nification; between

 

mind and logos, a relationship of conventional sym

bolization. And the 

first 

convention, which

 

would relate immediately to the order of natural and universal signification, would be

 

produced as spoken language. Written language would establish the conventions, inter-linking

 

other conventions with them.

Just as all men have not the same writing so all men have not the same speech sounds, but

 

mental experiences, of which these are the 

primary symbols (semeia prôtos), 

are the same for

 

all, as also are those things of which our experiences are the images 

(De interpretatione, 

1,

 

16a. Italics added) .

The feelings of the mind, expressing things naturally, constitute a sort of universal language

 

which can then efface itself. It is the stage of transparence. Aristotle can sometimes omit it

 

without risk. 5 In every case, the voice is closest to the signified, whether it is determined

 

strictly as sense (thought or lived) or more loosely as thing. All signifiers, and first and

 

foremost the written signifier, are derivative with regard to what would wed the voice

 

indissolubly to the mind or to the thought of the signified sense, indeed to the thing itself

 

(whether it is done in the Aristotelian manner that we have just indicated or in the manner of

 

medieval theology, determining the 

res 

as a thing created from its 

eidos, 

from its sense

 

thought in the logos or in the infinite understanding of God). The written signifier is always

 

technical and representative. It has no constitutive mean-ing. This derivation is the very origin

 

of the notion of the “signifier.” The notion of the sign always implies within itself the

 

distinction between sig

nifier and signified, even if, as Saussure argues, they are distinguished

 

simply as the two faces of one and the same leaf. This notion remains therefore within the

 

heritage of that logocentrism which is also a phonocentrism:

((12))




absolute proximity of voice and being, of voice and the meaning of being, of voice and the

 

ideality of meaning. Hegel demonstrates very clearly the strange privilege of sound in

 

idealization, the production of the concept and the self-presence of the subject.

This ideal motion, in which through the sound what is as it were the simple subjectivity

 

[Subjektivität], 

the soul of the material thing expresses itself, the ear receives also in a

 

theoretical 

[theoretisch] 

way, just as the eye shape and colour, thus allowing the interiority of

 

the object to become interiority itself 

[läßt dadurch das Innere der Gegenstände fur das

 

Innere selbst werden] (Esthétique, 

III. I tr. fr. p. 16).* . . . The ear, on the contrary, perceives

 

[vernimmt] 

the result of that interior vibration of material substance without placing itself in a

 

practical relation toward the objects, a result by means of which it is no longer the material

 

form 

[Gestalt] 

in its repose, but the first, more ideal activity of the soul itself which is

 

manifested 

[zum Vorschein kommt] 

(p. 296) . **

What is said of sound in general is a fortiori valid for the 

phone 

by which, by virtue of hearing

 

(understanding)-oneself-speak—an indissociable sys

tem—the subject affects itself and is

 

related to itself in the element of ideality.

We already have a foreboding that phonocentrism merges with the his

torical determination of

 

the meaning of being in general as 

presence, 

with all the subdeterminations which depend on

 

this general form and which organize within it their system and their historical sequence

 

(presence of the thing to the sight as 

eidos, 

presence as substance/essence/existence 

[ousia],

 

temporal presence as point 

[stigmè] 

of the now or of the moment 

[nun], 

the self-presence of

 

the cogito, consciousness, subjectivity, the co-presence of the other and of the self,

 

intersubjectivity as the intentional phenomenon of the ego, and so forth). Logocentrism would

 

thus support the determination of the being of the entity as presence. To the extent that such a

 

logocentrism is not totally absent from Heidegger’s thought, per

haps it still holds that thought

 

within the epoch of onto-theology, within the philosophy of presence, that is to say within

 

philosophy 

itself. 

This would perhaps mean that one does not leave the epoch whose closure

 

one can outline. The movements of belonging or not belonging to the epoch are too subtle, the

 

illusions in that regard are too easy, for us to make a definite judgment.

The epoch of the logos thus debases writing considered as mediation of

mediation and as a fall into the exteriority of meaning. To this epoch belongs the difference

 

between signified and signifier, or at least the strange separation of their “parallelism,” and

 

the exteriority, however extenuated, of the one to the other. This appurtenance is organized

 

and hierarchized in a history. The difference between signified and signifier belongs in a pro-




found and implicit way to the totality of the great epoch covered by the history of

 

metaphysics, and in a more explicit and more systematically articulated way to the narrower

 

epoch of Christian creationism and in

finitism when these appropriate the resources of Greek

 

conceptuality. This appurtenance is essential and irreducible; one cannot retain the

 

convenience or the “scientific truth” of the Stoic and later medieval opposition between

 

signans 

and 

signatum 

without also bringing with it all its metaphysico

theological roots. To

 

these roots adheres not only the distinction between the sensible and the intelligible—already

 

a great deal—with all that it controls, namely, metaphysics in its totality. And this distinction

 

is generally accepted as self-evident by the most careful linguists and semi

ologists, even by

 

those who believe that the scientificity of their work begins where metaphysics ends. Thus,

 

for example:

As modem structural thought has clearly realized, language is a system of signs and

 

linguistics is part and parcel of the science of signs, or 

semiotics 

(Saussure’s 

sémiologie). 

The

 

mediaeval definition of 

sign—

“

aliquid stat pro aliquo”—has 

been resurrected and put

 

forward as still valid and productive. Thus the con

stitutive mark of any sign in general and of

 

any linguistic sign in particular is its twofold character: every linguistic unit is bipartite and

 

involves both aspects —one sensible and the other intelligible, or in other words, both the

 

signans 

“signifier” (Saussure’s 

signifiant) 

and the 

signatum 

“signified” 

(signifié) . 

These two

 

constituents of a linguistic sign (and of sign in general) necessarily sup-pose and require each

 

other. 6

But to these metaphysico-theological roots many other hidden sediments cling. The

 

semiological or, more specifically, linguistic “science” cannot therefore hold on to the

 

difference between signifier and signified—the very idea of the sign—without the difference

 

between sensible and intelligible; certainly, but also not without retaining, more profoundly

 

and more im plicitly, and by the same token the reference to a signified able to “take place” in

 

its intelligibility, before its “fall,” before any expulsion into the exteriority of the sensible here

 

below. As the face of pure intelligibility, ii refers to an absolute logos to which it is

 

immediately united. This absolutf logos was an infinite creative subjectivity in medieval

 

theology: the intelli gible face of the sign remains turned toward the word and the face of God

Of course, it is not a question of “rejecting” these notions; they an necessary and, at least at

 

present, nothing is conceivable for us withou them. It is a question at first of demonstrating

 

the systematic and historica

((14))

solidarity of the concepts and gestures of thought that one often believes can be innocently

 

separated. The sign and divinity have the same place and time of birth. The age of the sign is

 

essentially theological. Perhaps it will never 

end. 

Its historical 

closure is, 

however, outlined.

Since these concepts are indispensable for unsettling the heritage to which they belong, we

 

should be even less prone to renounce them. Within the closure, by an oblique and always

 

perilous movement, constantly risk-ing falling back within what is being deconstructed, it is

 

necessary to surround the critical concepts with a careful and thorough discourse—to mark

 

the conditions, the medium, and the limits of their effectiveness and to designate rigorously

 

their intimate relationship to the machine whose deconstruction they permit; and, in the same

 

process, designate the crevice through which the yet unnameable glimmer beyond the closure

 

can be glimpsed. The concept of the sign is here exemplary. We have just marked its

 




metaphysical appurtenance. We know, however, that the thematics of the sign have been for

 

about a century the agonized labor of a tradition that professed to withdraw meaning, truth,

 

presence, being, etc., from the movement of signification. Treating as suspect, as I just have,

 

the difference between signified and signifier, or the idea of the sign in general, I must state

 

explicitly that it is not a question of doing so in terms of the in-stance of the present truth,

 

anterior, exterior or superior to the sign, or in terms of the place of the effaced difference.

 

Quite the contrary. We are dis-turbed by that which, in the concept of the sign—which has

 

never existed or functioned outside the history of (the) philosophy (of presence)—remains

 

systematically and genealogically determined by that history. It is there that the concept and

 

above all the work of deconstruction, its “style,” re-main by nature exposed to

 

misunderstanding and nonrecognition.

The exteriority of the signifier is the exteriority of writing in general, and I shall try to show

 

later that there is no linguistic sign before writing. Without that exteriority, the very idea of

 

the sign falls into decay. Since our entire world and language would collapse with it, and since

 

its evi

dence and its value keep, to a certain point of derivation, an indestructible solidity, it

 

would be silly to conclude from its placement within an epoch that it is necessary to “move on

 

to something else,” to dispose of the sign, of the term and the notion. For a proper

 

understanding of the gesture that we are sketching here, one must understand the expressions

 

“epoch,” “closure of an epoch,” “historical genealogy” in a new way; and must first remove

 

them from all relativism.

Thus, within this epoch, reading and writing, the production or interpre

tation of signs, the text

 

in general as fabric of signs, allow themselves to be confined within secondariness. They are

 

preceded by a truth, or a mean-ing already constituted by and 

within the 

element of the logos.

 

Even when

((15))

the thing, the “referent,” is not immediately related to the logos of a creator God where it

 

began by being the spoken/thought sense, the signified has at any rate an immediate

 

relationship with the logos in general (finite or infinite), and a mediated one with the signifier,

 

that is to say with the exteriority of writing. ‘When it seems to go otherwise, it is because a

 

metaphoric mediation has insinuated itself into the relationship and has simulated immediacy;

 

the writing of truth in the soul, opposed by 

Phaedrus 

(z78a) to bad writing (writing in the

 

“literal” 

[pro pre] 

and ordinary sense, “sensible” writing, “in space”), the book of Nature and

 

God’s writing, espe

cially in the Middle Ages; all that functions as 

metaphor 

in these

 

discourses confirms the privilege of the logos and founds the “literal” meaning then given to

 

writing: a sign signifying a signifier itself signifying an eternal verity, eternally thought and

 

spoken in the proximity of a present logos. The paradox to which attention must be paid is

 

this: natural and universal writing, intelligible and nontemporal writing, is thus named by

 

metaphor. A writing that is sensible, finite, and so on, is designated as writing in the literal

 

sense; it is thus thought on the side of culture, technique, and artifice; a human procedure, the

 

ruse of a being accidentally incarnated or of a finite creature. Of course, this metaphor

 

remains enigmatic and refers to a “literal” meaning of writing as the first metaphor. This

 

“literal” mean-ing is yet unthought by the adherents of this discourse. It is not, therefore, a

 

matter of inverting the literal meaning and the figurative meaning but of determining the

 

“literal” meaning of writing as metaphoricity itself.




In “The Symbolism of the Book,” that excellent chapter of 

European Literature and the Latin

 

Middle Ages, 

E. R. Curtius describes with great wealth of examples the evolution that led

 

from the 

Phaedrus 

to Calderon, until it seemed to be “precisely the reverse” (tr. fr. p. 372) *

 

by the “newly attained position of the book” (p. 374) [p. 306]. But it seems that this

 

modification, however important in fact it might be, conceals a funda

mental continuity. As

 

was the case with the Platonic writing of the truth in the soul, in the Middle Ages too it is a

 

writing understood in the meta

phoric sense, that is to say a 

natural, 

eternal, and universal

 

writing, the system of signified truth, which is recognized in its dignity. As in the 

Phaedrus, 

a

 

certain fallen writing continues to be opposed to it. There remains to be written a history of

 

this metaphor, a metaphor that syste

matically contrasts divine or natural writing and the

 

human and laborious, finite and artificial inscription. It remains to articulate rigorously the

 

stages of that history, as marked by the quotations below, and to follow the

few sparse pages that one should look for God’s law, but in the human heart where His hand

 

deigned to write 

(Lettre à Vernes) . *

If the natural law had been written only in the human reason, it would be little capable of

 

directing most of our actions. But it is also engraved in the heart of man in ineffacable

 

characters. . . . There it cries to him 

(L’état de guerre.) **




Natural writing is immediately united to the voice and to breath. Its nature is not

 

grammatological but pneumatological. It is hieratic, very close to the interior holy voice of the

 

Profession of Faith, 

to the voice one hears upon retreating into oneself: full and truthful

 

presence of the divine voice to our inner sense: “The more I retreat into myself, the more I

 

consult myself, the more plainly do I read these words written in my soul: be just and you will

 

be happy. . . . I do not derive these rules from the princi

ples äf the higher philosophy, I find

 

them in the depths of my heart writ-ten by nature in characters which nothing can efface.” ***

There is much to say about the fact that the native unity of the voice and writing is

 

prescriptive. 

Arche-speech is writing because it is a law. A natural law. The beginning word is

 

understood, in the intimacy of self-presence, as the voice of the other and as commandment.

There is therefore a good and a bad writing: the good and natural is the divine inscription in

 

the heart and the soul; the perverse and artful is technique, exiled in the exteriority of the

 

body. A modification well within

the Platonic diagram: writing of the soul and of the body, writing of the interior and of the

 

exterior, writing of conscience and of the passions, as there is a voice of the soul and a voice

 

of the body. “Conscience is the voice of the soul, the passions are the voice of the body” [p.

 

249]. One must constantly go back toward the “voice of nature,” the “holy voice of nature,”

 

that merges with the divine inscription and prescription; one must encounter oneself within it,

 

enter into a dialogue within its signs, speak and respond to oneself in its pages.

It was as if nature had spread out all her magnificence in front of our eyes to offer its text for

 

our consideration. . . . I have therefore closed all the books. Only one is open to all eyes. It is

 

the book of Nature. In this great and sublime book I learn to serve and adore its author.

The good writing has therefore always been 

comprehended. 

Compre

hended as that which had

 

to be comprehended: within a nature or a natural law, created or not, but first thought within

 

an eternal presence. Comprehended, therefore, within a totality, and enveloped in a volume or

 

a book. The idea of the book is the idea of a totality, finite or infinite, of the signifier; this

 

totality of the signifier cannot be a totality, unless a totality constituted by the signified

 

preexists it, supervises its inscriptions and its signs, and is independent of it in its ideality. The

 

idea of the book, which always refers to a natural totality, is profoundly alien to the sense of

 

writing. It is the encyclopedic protection of theology and of logocentrism against the

 




disruption of writing, against its aphoristic energy, and, as I shall specify later, against

 

difference in general. If I dis

tinguish the text from the book, I shall say that the destruction of

 

the book, as it is now under way in all domains, denudes the surface of the text. That

 

necessary violence responds to a violence that was no less necessary.

The Written Being/ The Being Written

The reassuring evidence within which Western tradition had to organize itself and must

 

continue to live would therefore be as follows: the order of the signified is never

 

contemporary, is at best the subtly discrepant inverse or parallel—discrepant by the time of a

 

breath—from the order of the sig

nifier. And the sign must be the unity of a heterogeneity,

 

since the signified (sense or thing, noeme or reality) is not in itself a signifier, 

a trace: 

in any

 

case is not constituted in its sense by its relationship with a possible trace. The formal essence

 

of the signified is 

presence, 

and the privilege of its proximity to the logos as 

phonè 

is the

 

privilege of presence. This is the in

evitable response as soon as one asks: “what is the sign?,”

 

that is to say, when one submits the sign to the question of essence, to the “ti esti.” The

 

“formal essence” of the sign can only be determined in terms of presence.

((19))

One cannot get around that response, except by challenging the very form of the question and

 

beginning to think that the sign [is med kryss] that ill-named [thing med kryss], the only one,

 

that escapes the instituting question of philosophy: “what is ...?” 8

Radicalizing the concepts of 

interpretation, perspective, evaluation, dif

ference, 

and all the

 

“empiricist” or nonphilosophical motifs that have constanty tormented philosophy throughout

 

the history of the \Vest, and besides, have had nothing but the inevitable weakness of being

 

produced in the field of philosophy, Nietzsche, far from remaining 

simply 

(with Hegel and as

 

Heidegger wished) 

within 

metaphysics, contributed a great deal to the liberation of the

 

signifier from its dependence or derivation with respect to the logos and the related concept of

 

truth or the primary signified, in whatever sense that is understood. Reading, and therefore

 

writ-ing, the text were for Nietzsche “originary” 9 operations (I put that word within quotation

 

marks for reasons to appear later) with regard to a sense that they do not first have to

 

transcribe or discover, which would not therefore be a truth signified in the original element

 

and presence of the logos, as 

topos noetos, 

divine understanding, or the structure of a priori

 

necessity. To save Nietzsche from a reading of the Heideggerian type, it seems that we must

 

above all not attempt to restore or make explicit a less naive “ontology,” composed of

 

profound ontological intuitions acceding to some originary truth, an entire fundamentality

 

hidden under the appear

ance of an empiricist or metaphysical text. The virulence of

 

Nietzschean thought could not be more competely misunderstood. On the contrary, one must

 

accentuate 

the “naiveté” of a breakthrough which cannot attempt a step outside of

 

metaphysics, which cannot 

criticize 

metaphysics radically without still utilizing in a certain

 

way, in a certain type or a certain style of 

text, 

propostions that, read within the philosophic

 

corpus, that is to say according to Nietzsche ill-read or unread, have always been and will

 

always be “naivetés,” incoherent signs of an absolute appurtenance. Therefore, rather that

 

protect Nietzsche from the Heideggerian reading, we should perhaps offer him up to it

 




completely, underwriting that interpretation without reserve; in 

a certain way 

and up to the

 

point where, the content of the Nietzschean discourse being almost lost for the question of

 

being, its form regains its absolute strangeness, where his text finally invokes a differ

ent type

 

of reading, more faithful to his type of writing: Nietzsche has 

written what 

he has written. He

 

has written that writing—and first of all his own—is not originarily subordinate to the logos

 

and to truth. And that this subordination has 

come into being 

during an epoch whose meaning

 

we must deconstruct. Now in this direction (but only in this direction, for read otherwise, the

 

Nietzschean demolition remains dogmatic and, like all reversals, a captive of that

 

metaphysical edifice which it professes to over-throw. On that point and in that 

order of

 

reading, 

the conclusions of

((20))

Heidegger and Fink are irrefutable), Heideggerian thought would reinstate rather than destroy

 

the instance of the logos and of the truth of being as “primum signatum:” the “transcendental”

 

signified (“transcendental” in a certain sense, as in the Middle Ages the transcendental—ens,

 

unum, verum, bonum—was 

said to be the “primum cognitum”) implied by all categories or all

 

determined significations, by all lexicons and all syntax, and therefore by all linguistic

 

signifiers, though not to be identified simply with any one of those signifiers, allowing itself

 

to be precomprehended through each of them, remaining irreducible to all the epochal

 

determina

tions that it nonetheless makes possible, thus opening the history of the logos, yet

 

itself being only through the logos; that is, 

being nothing 

before the logos and outside of it.

 

The logos of being, “Thought obeying the Voice of Being,” 10 is the first and the last resource

 

of the sign, of the difference between 

signans 

and 

signatum. 

There has to be a transcendental

 

signified for the difference between signifier and signified to be somewhere absolute and

 

irreducible. It is not by chance that the thought of being, as the thought of this transcendental

 

signified, is manifested above all in the voice: in a language of words 

[mots]. 

The voice is

 

heard 

(understood)—that undoubtedly is what is called conscience—closest to the self as the

 

absolute effacement of the signifier: pure auto-affection that necessarily has the form of time

 

and which does not borrow from outside of itself, in the world or in “reality,” any accessory

 

signifier, any substance of expression foreign to its own spontaneity. It is the unique

 

experience of the signified producing itself spontaneously, from within the self, and

 

nevertheless, as signified concept, in the element of ideality or universality. The unworldly

 

character of this substance of expression is constitutive of this ideality. This experience of the

 

effacement of the signifier in the voice is not merely one illusion among many—since it is the

 

condition of the very idea of truth—but I shall elsewhere show in what it does delude itself.

 

This illusion is the history of truth and it cannot be dissipated so quickly. Within the closure of

 

this experience, the word 

[mot] is 

lived as the elementary and undecomposable unity of the

 

signified and the voice, of the concept and a transparent substance of expression. This

 

experience is considered in its greatest purity—and at the same time in the condition of its

 

possibility—as the experience of “being.” The word “being,” or at any rate the words

 

lesignating the sense of being in different languages, is, with some others, an “originary

 

word” 

(“Urwort

”

)

, 11 the transcendental word assuring the 3ossibility of being-word to all

 

other words. As such, it is precomprehended n all language and—this is the opening of 

Being

 

and Time—only 

this pre-,omprehension would permit the opening of the question of the sense

 

of )eing in general, beyond all regional ontologies and all metaphysics: a ques

ion that

 

broaches philosophy (for example, in the 

Sophist) 

and lets itself

((21))




be taken over by philosophy, a question that Heidegger repeats by sub

mitting the history of

 

metaphysics to it. Heidegger reminds us constantly that the sense of being is neither the word

 

“being” nor the concept of being. But as that sense is nothing outside of language and the

 

language of words, it is tied, if not to a particular word or to a particular system of language

 

(concesso non dato), at least to the possibility of the word in general. And to the possibility of

 

its irreducible simplicity. One could thus think that it remains only to choose between two

 

possibilities. 

(a) 

Does a modem linguistics, a science of signification breaking the unity of the

 

word and breaking with its alleged irreducibility, still have anything to do with “language?”

 

Heidegger would probably doubt it. (2) Conversely, is not all that is profoundly meditated as

 

the thought or the question of being enclosed within an old linguistics of the word which one

 

practices here unknowingly? Unknowingly because such a linguistics, whether spontane

ous or

 

systematic, has always had to share the presuppositions of meta-physics. The two operate on

 

the same grounds.

It goes without saying that the alternatives cannot be so simple.

On the one hand, if modern linguistics remains completely enclosed within a classical

 

conceptuality, if especially it naively uses the word 

being 

and all that it presupposes, that

 

which, within this linguistics, decon

structs the unity of the word in general can no longer,

 

according to the model of the Heideggerian question, as it functions powerfully from the very

 

opening of 

Being and Time, 

be circumscribed as ontic science or regional ontology. In as

 

much as the question of being unites indis

solubly with the precomprehension of the 

word

 

being, 

without being re

duced to it, the linguistics that works for the deconstruction of the con

-

stituted unity of that word has only, in fact or in principle, to have the question of being posed

 

in order to define its field and the order of its dependence.

Not only is its field no longer simply ontic, but the limits of ontology that correspond to it no

 

longer have anything regional about them. And can what I say here of linguistics, or at least of

 

a certain work that may be undertaken within it and thanks to it, not be said of all research 

in

 

as much as and to the strict extent that 

it would finally deconstitute the founding concept-

words of ontology, of being in its privilege? Outside of linguistics, it is in psychoanalytic

 

research that this breakthrough seems at present to have the greatest likelihood of being

 

expanded.

Within the strictly limited space of this breakthrough, these “sciences” are no longer

 

dominated 

by the questions of a transcendental phe

nomenology or a fundamental ontology.

 

One may perhaps say, following the order of questions inaugurated by 

Being and Time 

and

 

radicalizing the questions of Husserlian phenomenology, that this breakthrough does

((22))

not belong to science itself, that what thus seems to be produced within an ontic field or

 

within a regional ontology, does not belong to them by rights and leads back to the question of

 

being itself.

Because it is indeed the 

question 

of being that Heidegger asks metaphysics. And with it the

 

question of truth, of sense, of the logos. The incessant meditation upon that question does not

 

restore confidence. On the contrary, it dislodges the confidence at its own depth, which, being

 

a matter of the meaning of being, is more difficult than is often believed. In examining the

 

state just before all determinations of being, destroying the securities of onto-theology, such a

 




meditation contributes, quite as much as the most contemporary linguistics, to the dislocation

 

of the unity of the sense of being, that is, in the last instance, the unity of the word.

It is thus that, after evoking the “voice of being,” Heidegger recalls that it is silent, mute,

 

insonorous, wordless, originarily 

a-phonic (die Gewähr der lautlosen Stimme verborgener

 

Quellen . . .). 

The voice of the sources is not heard. A rupture between the originary meaning

 

of being and the word, between meaning and the voice, between “the voice of being” and the

 

“

phonè,” 

between “the call of being,” and articulated sound; such a rupture, which at once

 

confirms a fundamental metaphor, and renders it suspect by accentuating its metaphoric

 

discrepancy, trans-lates the ambiguity of the Heideggerian situation with respect to the

 

metaphysics of presence and logocentrism. It is at once contained within it and transgresses it.

 

But it is impossible to separate the two. The very movement of transgression sometimes holds

 

it back short of the limit. In opposition to what we suggested above, it must be remembered

 

that, for Heidegger, the sense of being is never simply and rigorously a “signified.” It is not by

 

chance that that word is not used; that means that being escapes the movement of the sign, a

 

proposition that can equally well be understood as a repetition of the classical tradition and as

 

a caution with respect to a technical or metaphysical theory of signification. On the other

 

hand, the sense of being is literally neither “primary,” nor “fundamental,” nor

 

“transcendental,” whether understood in the scholastic, Kantian, or Husserlian sense. The

 

restoration of being as “transcending” the categories of the entity, the opening of the

 

fundamental ontology, are nothing but necessary yet provisional moments. From 

The

 

Introduction to Meta-physics 

onward, Heidegger renounces the project of and the word ontol

-

ogy. 12 The necessary, originary, and irreducible dissimulation of the mean-ing of being, its

 

occultation within the very blossoming forth of presence, that retreat without which there

 

would be no history of being which was completely 

history 

and history of 

being, 

Heidegger’s

 

insistence on noting that being is produced as history only through the logos, and is nothing

 

outside of it, the difference between being and the entity—all this clearly indicates that

 

fundamentally nothing escapes the movement of the signifier

((23))

and that, in the last instance, the difference between signified and signifier 

is nothing. 

This

 

proposition of transgression, not yet integrated into a careful discourse, runs the risk of

 

formulating regression itself. One must therefore 

go by way of 

the question of being as it is

 

directed by Heidegger and by him alone, at and beyond onto-theology, in order to reach the

 

rigorous thought of that strange nondifference and in order to deter-mine it correctly.

 

Heidegger occasionally reminds us that “being,” as it is fixed in its general syntactic and

 

lexicological forms within linguistics and Western philosophy, is not a primary and absolutely

 

irreducible signified, that it is still rooted in a system of languages and an historically deter-

mined “significance,” although strangely privileged as the virtue of dis-closure and

 

dissimulation; particularly when he invites us to meditate on the “privilege” of the “third

 

person singular of the present indicative” and the “infinitive.” \Vestem metaphysics, as the

 

limitation of the sense of being within the field of presence, is produced as the domination of

 

a linguistic form.13 To question the origin of that domination does not amount to

 

hypostatizing a transcendental signified, but to a questioning of what constitutes our history

 

and what produced transcendentality itself. Heidegger brings it up also when in 

Zur Seinsf

 

rage, 

for the same reason, he lets the word “being” be read only if it is crossed out

 

(kreuzweise Durchstreichung). 

That mark of deletion is not, however, a “merely nega

tive

 

symbol” (p. 31) [p. 83]. That deletion is the final writing of an epoch. Under its strokes the

 

presence of a transcendental signified is effaced while still remaining legible. Is effaced while

 




still remaining legible, is destroyed while making visible the very idea of the sign. In as much

 

as it de-limits onto-theology, the metaphysics of presence and logocentrism, this last writing is

 

also the first writing.

To come to recognize, not within but on the horizon of the Heideggerian paths, and yet in

 

them, that the sense of being is not a transcendental or trans-epochal signified (even if it was

 

always dissimulated within the epoch) but already, in a truly 

unheard of 

sense, a determined

 

signifying trace, is to affirm that within the decisive concept of ontico-ontological difference,

 

all is not to be thought at one go; 

entity and being, ontic and ontological, “ontico-

ontological,” are, in an original style, 

derivative 

with regard to difference; and with respect to

 

what I shall later call 

differance, 

an economic concept designating the production of

 

differing/deferring. The ontico-ontological difference and its ground 

(Grund) 

in the “tran

-

scendence of Dasein” 

(Vom Wesen des Grundes 

[Frankfurt am Main, 1955], p. i6 [p. 29]) are

 

not absolutely originary. Differance by itself would be more “originary,” but one would no

 

longer be able to call it “origin” or “ground,” those notions belonging essentially to the

 

history of onto-theology, to the system functioning as the effacing of difference. It can,

 

however, be thought of in the closest proximity to itself only on

((24))

one condition: that one begins by determining it as the ontico-ontologica’ difference before

 

erasing that determination. The necessity of passing through that erased determination, the

 

necessity of that 

trick of writing 

is irreducible. An unemphatic and difficult thought that,

 

through much unperceived mediation, must carry the entire burden of our question, a question

 

that I shall provisionally call 

historiai [historiale]. 

It is with its help that I shall later be able

 

to attempt to relate differance and writing.

The hestitation of these thoughts (here Nietzsche’s and Heidegger’s) is not an “incoherence”:

 

it is a trembling proper to all post-Hegelian attempts and to this passage between two epochs.

 

The movements of deconstruction do not destroy structures from the outside. They are not

 

possible and effective, nor can they take accurate aim, except by inhabiting those structures.

 

Inhabiting them 

in a certain way, 

because one always inhabits, and all the more when one

 

does not suspect it. Operating necessarily from the inside, borrowing all the strategic and

 

economic resources of subversion from the old structure, borrowing them structurally, that is

 

to say without being able to isolate their elements and atoms, the enterprise of deconstruction

 

always in a certain way falls prey to its own work. This is what the person who has begun the

 

same work in another area of the same habitation does not fail to point out with zeal. No

 

exercise is more wide-spread today and one should be able to formalize its rules.

Hegel was already caught up in this game. 

On the one hand, 

he un

doubtedly 

summed up 

the

 

entire philosophy of the logos. He determined ontology as absolute logic; he assembled all the

 

delimitations of philosophy as presence; he assigned to presence the eschatology of parousia,

 

of the self-proximity of infinite subjectivity. And for the same reason he had to debase or

 

subordinate writing. ‘When he criticizes the Leibnizian characteristic, the formalism of the

 

understanding, and mathematical symbolism, he makes the same gesture: denouncing the

 

being-outside-of-itself of the logos in the sensible or the intellectual abstraction. Writing is

 

that forget-ting of the self, that exteriorization, the contrary of the interiorizing memory, of the

 

Erinnerung 

that opens the history of the spirit. It is this that the 

Phaedrus 

said: writing is at

 

once mnemotechnique and the power of forgetting. Naturally, the Hegelian critique of writing

 

stops at the alpha-bet. As phonetic writing, the alphabet is at the same time more servile, more

 




contemptible, more secondary (“alphabetic writing expresses 

sounds 

which are themselves

 

signs. It consists therefore of the signs of signs 

[

’

aus Zeichen der Zeichen’,” Enzyklopädie, §

 

459]) * but it is also the best writ-ing, the mind’s writing; its effacement before the voice, that

 

in it which respects the ideal interiority of phonic signifiers, all that by which it sub-

((25))

limates space and sight, all that makes of it the writing of history, the writing, that is, of the

 

infinite spirit relating to itself in its discourse and its culture:

It follows that to learn to read and write an alphabetic writing should be re

garded as a means

 

to infinite culture 

(unendliches Bildungsmittel) 

that is not enough appreciated; because thus

 

the mind, distancing itself from the concrete sense-perceptible, directs its attention on the

 

more formal moment, the sonorous word and its abstract elements, and contributes essentially

 

to the founding and purifying of the ground of interiority within the subject.

In that sense it is the 

Aufhebung 

of other writings, particularly of hiero

glyphic script and of

 

the Leibnizian characteristic that had been criti

cized previously through one and the same

 

gesture. 

(Aufhebung 

is, more or less implicitly, the dominant concept of nearly all histories of

 

writing, even today. It is 

the 

concept of history and of teleology.) In fact, Hegel continues:

 

“Acquired habit later also suppresses the specificity of alpha

betic writing, which consists in

 

seeming to be, in the interest of sight, a detour 

[Umweg] 

through hearing to arrive at

 

representations, and makes it into a hieroglyphic script for us, such that in using it, we do not

 

need to have present to our consciousness the mediation of sounds.”

It is on this condition that Hegel subscribes to the Leibnizian praise of nonphonetic writing. It

 

can be produced by deaf mutes, Leibniz had said. Hegel:

Beside the fact that, by the practice which transforms this alphabetic script into hieroglyphics,

 

the aptitude for abstraction acquired through such an exercise 

is conserved 

[italics added], the

 

reading of hieroglyphs is for itself a deaf reading and a mute writing 

(ein taubes Lesen and

 

ein stummes Schreiben). 

What is audible or temporal, visible or spatial, has each its proper

 

basis and in the first place they are of equal value; but in alphabetic script there is only 

one

 

basis and that following a specific relation, namely, that the visible language is related only as

 

a sign to the audible language; intelligence expresses itself immediately and unconditionally

 

through speech (ibid.).

What writing itself, in its nonphonetic moment, betrays, is life. It menaces at once the breath,

 

the spirit, and history as the spirit’s relation-ship with itself. It is their end, their finitude, their

 

paralysis. Cutting breath short, sterilizing or immobilizing spiritual creation in the repetition

 

of the letter, in the commentary or the 

exegesis, 

confined in a narrow space, reserved for a

 

minority, it is the principle of death and of difference in the becoming of being. It is to speech

 

what China is to Europe: “It is only to the exegeticism 14 of Chinese spiritual culture that

 




their hieroglyphic writ-ing is suited. This type of writing is, besides, the part reserved for a

 

very small section of a people, the section that possesses the exclusive domain

((26))

of spiritual culture. . . . A hieroglyphic script would require a philosophy as exegetical as

 

Chinese culture generally is” (ibid.) .

If the nonphonetic moment menaces the history and the life of the spirit as self-presence in the

 

breath, it is because it menaces substantiality, that other metaphysical name of presence and of

 

ousia. 

First in the form of the substantive. Nonphonetic writing breaks the noun apart. It

 

describes rela

tions and not appellations. The noun and the word, those unities of breath and

 

concept, are effaced within pure writing. In that regard, Leibniz is as disturbing as the Chinese

 

in Europe: “This situation, the analytic nota

tion of representations in hieroglyphic script,

 

which seduced Leibniz to the point of wrongly preferring this script to the alphabetic, rather

 

con

tradicts the fundamental exigency of language in general, namely the noun. . . . All

 

difference 

[Abweichung] 

in analysis would produce another formation of the written

 

substantive.”

The horizon of absolute knowledge is the effacement of writing in the logos, the retrieval of

 

the trace in parousia, the reappropriation of dif

ference, the accomplishment of what I have

 

elsewhere called 

15

 the 

metaphysics of the proper [le 

propre—self-possession, propriety,

 

property, cleanliness].

Yet, all that Hegel thought within this horizon, all, that is, except eschatology, may be reread

 

as a meditation on writing. Hegel is 

also 

the thinker of irreducible difference. He rehabilitated

 

thought as the 

memory productive 

of signs. And he reintroduced, as I shall try to show

 

elsewhere, the essential necessity of the written trace in a philosophical—that is to say

 

Socratic—discourse that had always believed it possible to do without it; the last philosopher

 

of the book and the first thinker of writing.

((27))

2. Linguistics and Grammatology

Writing is nothing but the representation of speech; it is bizarre that one gives more care to

 

the determining of the image than to the object.

—J.-J. Rousseau, 

Fragment inédit d’un essai

 

sur les langues

The concept of writing should define the field of a science. But can it be determined by

 

scholars outside of all the historico-metaphysical predetermi

nations that we have just situated

 

so clinically? What can a science of writing begin to signify, if it is granted:

1) that the very idea of science was bom in a certain epoch of writing;

2)that it was thought and formulated, as task, idea, project, in a lan

guage implying a certain

 

kind of structurally and axiologically determined relationship between speech and writing;




3)that, to that extent, it was first related to the concept and the ad-venture of phonetic writing,

 

valorized as the telos of all writing, even though what was always the exemplary model of

 

scientificity—mathematics —constantly moved away from that goal;

4)that the strictest notion of a 

general science of writing 

was born, for nonfortuitous reasons,

 

during a certain period of the world’s history (be-ginning around the eighteenth century) and

 

within a certain determined system of relationships between “living” speech and inscription;

5)that writing is not only an auxiliary means in the service of science—and possibly its object

—but first, as Husserl in particular pointed out in 

The Origin of Geometry, 

the condition of

 

the possibility of ideal objects and therefore of scientific objectivity. Before being its object,

 

writing is the condition of the 

epistémè.

6)that historicity itself is tied to the possibility of writing; to the possi

bility of writing in

 

general, beyond those particular forms of writing in the name of which we have long spoken

 

of peoples without writing and with-out history. Before being the object of a history—of an

 

historical science—writing opens the field of history—of historical becoming. And the former

 

(Historie 

in German) presupposes the latter 

(Geschichte).

The science of writing should therefore look for its object at the roots of scientificity. The

 

history of writing should turn back toward the origin of historicity. A science of the possibility

 

of science? A science of science

((28))

which would no longer have the form of 

logic 

but that of 

grammatics? A 

history of the

 

possibility of history which would no longer be an archaeol

ogy, a philosophy of history or a

 

history of philosophy?

The 

positive 

and the classical sciences of writing are obliged to repress this sort of question.

 

Up to a certain point, such repression is even neces

sary to the progress of positive

 

investigation. Beside the fact that it would still be held within a philosophizing logic, the

 

ontophenomenological ques

tion of essence, that is to say of the origin of writing, could, by

 

itself, only paralyze or sterilize the typological or historical research of 

facts.

My intention, therefore, is not to weigh that prejudicial question, that dry, necessary, and

 

somewhat facile question of right, against the power and efficacy of the positive researches

 

which we may witness today. The genesis and system of scripts had never led to such

 

profound, extended, and assured explorations. It is not really a matter of weighing the

 

question against the importance of the discovery; since the questions are imponder

able, they

 

cannot be weighed. If the issue is not quite that, it is perhaps because its repression has real

 

consequences in the very content of the researches that, in the present case and in a privileged

 

way, are always arranged around problems of definition and beginning.

The grammatologist least of all can avoid questioning himself about the essence of his object

 

in the form of a question of origin: “What is writing?” means “where and when does writing

 

begin?” The responses generally come very quickly. They circulate within concepts that are

 

seldom criticized and move within evidence which always seems self-evident. It is around

 

these responses that a typology of and a perspective on the growth of writing are always

 

organized. All works dealing with the history of writing are com

posed along the same lines: a

 




philosophical and teleological classification ex

hausts the critical problems in a few pages; one

 

passes next to an exposition of facts. ‘We have a contrast between the theoretical fragility of

 

the recon

structions and the historical, archeological, ethnological, philosophical wealth of

 

information.

The question of the origin of writing and the question of the origin of language are difficult to

 

separate. Grammatologists, who are generally by training historians, epigraphists, and

 

archeologists, seldom relate their researches to the modem science of language. It is all the

 

more surprising that, among the “sciences of man,” linguistics is the one science whose

 

scientificity is given as an example with a zealous and insistent unanimity.

Has grammatology, then, the right to expect from linguistics an essential assistance that it has

 

almost never looked for? On the contrary, does one not find efficaciously at work, in the very

 

movement by which linguistics is instituted as a science, a metaphysical presupposition about

 

the rela

tionship between speech and writing? Would that presupposition not hinder the

 

constitution of a general science of writing? Is not the lifting of

((29))

that presupposition an overthrowing of the landscape upon which the science of language is

 

peacefully installed? For better and for worse? For blindness as well as for productivity? This

 

is the second type of question that I now wish to outline. To develop this question, I should

 

like to ap

proach, as a privileged example, the project and texts of Ferdinand de Saussure. That

 

the particularity of the example does not interfere with the generality of my argument is a

 

point which I shall occasionally try not merely to take for granted.

Linguistics thus wishes to be the science of language. Let us set aside all the implicit

 

decisions that have established such a project and all the questions about its own origin that

 

the fecundity of this science allows to remain dormant. Let us first simply consider that the

 

scientificity of that science is often acknowledged because of its 

phonological 

foundations.

 

Phonology, it is often said today, communicates its scientificity to lin

guistics, which in turn

 

serves as the epistemological model for all the sciences of man. Since the deliberate and

 

systematic phonological orienta

tion of linguistics (Troubetzkoy, Jakobson, Martinet) carries

 

out an inten

tion which was originally Saussure’s, I shall, at least provisionally, confine myself

 

to the latter. Will my argument be equally applicable a fortiori to the most accentuated forms

 

of phonologism? The problem will at least be stated.

The science of linguistics determines language—its field of objectivity—in the last instance

 

and in the irreducible simplicity of its essence, as the unity of the 

phone, 

the glossa, and the

 

logos. 

This determination is by rights anterior to all the eventual differentiations that could

 

arise within the systems of terminology of the different schools (language/speech 

[langue/

 

parole]; 

code/message; scheme/usage; linguistic/logic; phonology/phone

-

matics/phonetics/glossematics). And even if one wished to keep sonority on the side of the

 

sensible and contingent signifier (which would be strictly speaking impossible, since formal

 

identities isolated within a sensible mass are already idealities that are not purely sensible), it

 

would have to be admitted that the immediate and privileged unity which founds signifi

cance

 

and the acts of language is the articulated unity of sound and sense within the phonie. With

 

regard to this unity, writing would always be de

rivative, accidental, particular, exterior,

 

doubling the signifier: phonetic. “Sign of a sign,” said Aristotle, Rousseau, and Hegel.




Yet, the intention that institutes general linguistics as a science remains in this respect within a

 

contradiction. Its declared purpose indeed confirms, saying what goes without saying, the

 

subordination of gram

matology, the historico-metaphysical reduction of writing to the rank of

 

an instrument enslaved to a full and originarily spoken language. But another gesture (not

 

another statement of purpose, for here what does not go without saying is done without being

 

said, written without being

((30))

uttered) liberates the future of a general grammatology of which lin

guistics-phonology would

 

be only a dependent and circumscribed area. Let us follow this tension between gesture and

 

statement in Saussure.

The Outside and the Inside*

On the one hand, true to the Western tradition that controls not only in theory but in practice

 

(in the principle of its practice) 

the relationships between speech and writing, Saussure does

 

not recognize in the latter more than 

a narrow 

and 

derivative 

function. Narrow because it is

 

nothing but one modality among others, a modality of the events which can befall a language

 

whose essence, as the facts seem to show, can remain forever un-contaminated by writing.

 

“Language does have an ... oral tradition that is independent of writing” 

(Cours de

 

linguistique générale, 

p. 

46). 

Derivative because 

representative: 

signifier of the first signifier,

 

representation of the self-present voice, of the immediate, natural, and direct signification of

 

the meaning (of the signified, of the concept, of the ideal object or what have you). Saussure

 

takes up the traditional definition of writing which, already in Plato and Aristotle, was

 

restricted to the model of phonetic script and the language of words. Let us recall the

 

Aristotelian definition: “Spoken words are the symbols of mental experience and written

 

words are the symbols of spoken words.” Saussure: “Language and writing are two dis

tinct

 

systems of signs; the second 

exists for the sole purpose of representing 

the first” (p. 

45; 

italics

 

added) [p. 

23

 **]

. 

This representative determination, beside communicating without a doubt

 

essentially with the idea of the sign, does not translate a choice or an evaluation, does not

 

betray a psycho-logical or metaphysical presupposition peculiar to Saussure; it describes or

 

rather reflects the structure of a certain type of writing: phonetic writing, which we use and

 

within whose element the 

epistémè 

in general (science and philosophy), and linguistics in

 

particular, could be founded. One should, moreover, 

say model 

rather than 

structure; 

it is not a

 

question of a system constructed and functioning perfectly, but of an ideal explicitly directing

 

a functioning which 

in fact is 

never completely phonetic. In fact, but also for reasons of

 

essence to which I shall frequently return.

To be sure this factum of phonetic writing is massive; it commands our entire culture and our

 

entire science, and it is certainly not just one fact

((31))

among others. Nevertheless it does not respond to any necessity of an absolute and universal

 

essence. Using this as a point of departure, Saussure defines the project and object of general

 

linguistics: “The linguistic object is not defined by the combination of the written word and

 

the spoken word: 

the spoken form alone constitutes the object” 

(p. 

45; 

italics added) [PP. 

23-

24].

The form of the question to which he responded thus entailed the re-sponse. It was a matter of

 

knowing what sort of 

word is 

the object of lin

guistics and what the relationships are between

 

the atomic unities that are the written and the spoken word. Now the word (vox) is already a

 

unity of sense and sound, of concept and voice, or, to speak a more rigorously Saussurian

 

language, of the signified and the signifier. This last terminology was moreover first proposed

 

in the domain of spoken language alone, of linguistics in the narrow sense and not in the

 

domain of semiology (“I propose to retain the word 

sign [signe] 

to designate the whole and to

 

replace 

concept 

and 

sound-image 

respectively by 

signified [signifié] 

and 

signifier [sign fiant]

 

“ 

p. 

99 

[p. 67]). The 

word is 

thus already a constituted unity, an effect of “the somewhat

 

mysterious fact . . . that ‘thought sound’ implies divisions” (p. 156) [p. 

112]. 

Even if the word

 

is in its turn articu

lated, even if it implies other divisions, as long as one poses the question of

 

the relationships between speech and writing in the light of the indi

visible units of the

 

“thought-sound,” there will always be the ready re-sponse. Writing will be “phonetic,” it will

 

be the outside, the exterior representation of language and of this “thought-sound.” It must

 

neces

sarily operate from already constituted units of signification, in the forma

tion of which it

 

has played no part.

Perhaps the objection will be made that writing up to the present has not only not

 

contradicted, but indeed confirmed the linguistics of the word. Hitherto I seem to have

 

maintained that only the fascination of the unit called 

word 

has prevented giving to writing

 

the attention that it merited. By that I seemed to suppose that, by ceasing to accord an ab-

solute privilege to the word, modern linguistics would become that much more attentive to

 

writing and would finally cease to regard it with suspicion. André Martinet comes to the

 

opposite conclusion. In his study “The Word,” 1 he describes the necessity that contemporary

 

linguistics obeys when it is led, if not to dispense everywhere with the concept of the word, at

 

least to make its usage more flexible, to associate it with the concepts of smaller or greater

 

units (monemes or syntagms). In accrediting and consolidating the division of language

 

into\words in certain areas of linguistics, writing would thus have encouraged classical

 

linguistics in its prejudices. Writing would have constructed or at least condensed the “screen

 

of the word.”

((32))

What a contemporary linguist can say of the word well illustrates the general revision of

 

traditional concepts that the functionalist and structuralist research of the last thirty-five years

 

had to undertake in order to give a scientific basis to the observation and description of

 

languages. Certain applications of linguistics, like the researches relating to mechanical

 




translation, by the emphasis they place on the written form of language, could make us

 

believe in the fundamental importance of the divisions of the written text and make us forget

 

that one must always start with the oral utterance in order to understand the real nature of

 

human language. Also it is more than ever indispensable to insist on the neces

sity of pushing

 

the examination beyond the immediate appearances and the structures most familiar to the

 

researcher. It is behind the screen of the word that the truly fundamental characteristics of

 

human language often appear.

One cannot but subscribe to this caution. Yet it must always be recog

nized that it throws

 

suspicion only on a certain type of writing: phonetic writing conforming to the empirically

 

determined and practiced divisions of ordinary oral language. The processes of mechanical

 

translation to which it alludes conform similarly to that spontaneous practice. Beyond that

 

model and that concept of writing, this entire demonstration must, it seems, be reconsidered.

 

For it remains trapped in the Saussurian limitation that we are attempting to explore.

In effect Saussure limits the number of systems of writing to two, both defined as system of

 

representation of the oral language, either represent-ing 

words 

in a synthetic and global

 

manner, or representing 

phonetically 

the elements of sounds constituting words:

There are only two systems of writing: i) In an ideographic system each word is represented

 

by a single sign that is unrelated to the component sounds of the word itself. Each written sign

 

stands for a whole word and, indirectly, for the idea expressed by the word. The classic

 

example of an ideographic system of writing is Chinese. 

2) 

The system commonly known as

 

“phonetic” tries to reproduce the succession of sounds that make up a word. Phonetic systems

 

are sometimes syllabic, sometimes alphabetic, i.e., based on the irreducible ele

ments of

 

speech. Moreover, ideographic systems freely become mixtures when certain ideograms lose

 

their original value and become symbols of isolated

sounds. (p. 47) [pp. 

2

5–26]

This limitation is at bottom justified, in Saussure’s eyes, by the notion of the arbitrariness of

 

the sign. Writing being defined as “a system of signs,” there is no “symbolic” writing (in the

 

Saussurian sense), no fig

urative writing; there is no 

writing 

as long as graphism keeps a

 

relation-ship of natural figuration and of some resemblance to what is then not 

sig

nified 

but

 

represented, drawn, etc. The concept of pictographic or natural writing would therefore be

 

contradictory for Saussure. If one considers the now recognized fragility of the notions of

 

pictogram, ideogram etc., and the uncertainty of the frontiers between so-called pictographic,

 

ideographic,

((33))

and phonetic scripts, one realizes not only the unwiseness of the Saus

surian limitation but the

 

need for general linguistics to abandon an entire family of concepts inherited from

 

metaphysics—often through the in

termediary of a psychology—and clustering around the

 

concept of arbi

trariness. All this refers, beyond the nature/culture opposition, to a super

vening

 

opposition between 

physis 

and 

nomos, physis 

and 

techné, 

whose ultimate function is perhaps

 

to 

derive 

historicity; and, paradoxically, not to recognize the rights of history, production,

 

institutions etc., except in the form of the arbitrary and in the substance of naturalism. But let

 

us keep that question provisionally open: perhaps this gesture, which in truth pre-sides over

 

metaphysics, is also inscribed in the concept of history and even in the concept of time.




In addition, Saussure introduces another massive limitation: “I shall limit discussion to the

 

phonetic system and especially to the one used today, the system that stems from the Greek

 

alphabet” (p. 48) [p. 26].

These two limitations are all the more reassuring because they are just what we need at a

 

specific point to fulfill the most legitimate of exigencies; in fact, the condition for the

 

scientificity of linguistics is that the field of linguistics have hard and fast frontiers, that it be a

 

system regulated by an 

internal 

necessity, and that in a certain way its structure be closed. The

 

representativist concept of writing facilitates things. If writing is nothing but the “figuration”

 

(p. 44) [p. 23] of the language, one has the right to exclude it from the interiority of the

 

system (for it must be believed that there is an 

inside 

of the language), as the image may be

 

excluded without damage from the system of reality. Proposing as his theme “the repre

-

sentation of language by writing” Saussure thus begins by positing that writing is “unrelated

 

to [the] ... inner system” of language (p. 44), [p. 23]. External/internal, image/reality,

 

representation/presence, such is the old grid to which is given the task of outlining the domain

 

of a science. And of what science? Of a science that can no longer answer to the classical con

-

cept of the 

epistémè 

because the originality of its field—an originality that it inaugurates-is

 

that the opening of the “image” within it appears as the condition of “reality;” a relationship

 

that can no longer be thought within the simple difference and the uncompromising exteriority

 

of “image” and “reality,” of “outside” and “inside,” of “appearance” and “essence,” with the

 

entire system of oppositions which necessarily follows from it. Plato, who said basically the

 

same thing about the relationship between writing, speech, and being (or idea), had at least a

 

more subtle, more critical, and less complacent theory of image, painting, and imitation than

 

the one that presides over the birth of Saussurian linguistics.

It is not by chance that the exclusive consideration of phonetic writing permits a response to

 

the exigencies of the “internal system.” The basic functional principle of phonetic writing is

 

precisely to respect and protect

((34))

the integrity of the “internal system” of the language, even if in fact it does not succeed in

 

doing so. 

The Saussurian limitation does not respond, by a mere happy convenience, to the

 

scientific exigency of the “internal 

sys

tem.” That exigency is itself constituted, as the

 

epistemological exigency in general, by the very possibility of phonetic writing and by the

 

exteriority of the “notation” to internal logic.

But let us not simplify: on that point Saussure too is not quite com

placent. Why else would he

 

give so much attention to that external phe

nomenon, that exiled figuration, that outside, that

 

double? Why does he judge it impossible “to simply disregard” [literally “make abstraction

 

of”] what is nevertheless designated as the abstract itself with respect to the inside of

 

language? “Writing, though unrelated to its inner system, is used continually to represent

 

language. We cannot simply disregard it. We must be acquainted with its usefulness,

 

shortcomings, and dangers” (p. 44) [P. 23]•

Writing would thus have the exteriority that one attributes to utensils; to what is even an

 

imperfect tool and a dangerous, almost maleficent, technique. One understands better why,

 

instead of treating this exterior figuration in an appendix or marginally, Saussure devotes so

 

laborious a chapter to it almost at the beginning of the 

Course. 

It is less a question of outlining

 

than of protecting, and even of restoring the internal system of the language in the purity of its

 




concept against the gravest, most perfidious, most permanent contamination which has not

 

ceased to menace, even to corrupt that system, in the course of what Saussure strongly wishes,

 

in spite of all opposition, to consider as an external history, as a series of accidents affecting

 

the language and befalling it 

from without, 

at the moment of “notation” (p. 45) [p. 24], as if

 

writing began and ended with notation. Already in the 

Phaedrus, 

Plato says that the evil of

 

writing comes from without (275a). The contamination by writing, the fact or the threat of it,

 

are denounced in the accents of the moralist or preacher by the linguist from Geneva. The

 

tone counts; it is as if, at the moment when the modern science of the logos would come into

 

its autonomy and its scien

tificity, it became necessary again to attack a heresy. This tone

 

began to make itself heard when, at the moment of already 

tying 

the 

epistémé 

and the logos

 

within the same possibility, the 

Phaedrus 

denounced writing as the intrusion of an artful

 

technique, a forced entry of a totally original sort, an archetypal violence: eruption of the

 

outside 

within the 

inside, 

breaching into the interiority of the soul, the living self-presence of

 

the soul within the true logos, the help that speech lends to itself. Thus incensed, Saussure’s

 

vehement argumentation aims at more than a theoretical error, more than a moral fault: at a

 

sort of stain and primarily at a sin. Sin has been defined often—among others by Malebranche

 

and by Kant—as the inversion of the natural relationship between the soul and the body

 

through bassion. Saussure here points at the inversion of the natural relationship

((35))

between speech and writing. It is not a simple analogy: writing, the letter, the sensible

 

inscription, has always been considered by Western tradition as the body and matter external

 

to the spirit, to breath, to speech, and to the logos. And the problem of soul and body is no

 

doubt derived from the problem of writing from which it seems—conversely—to borrow its

 

metaphors.

Writing, sensible matter and artificial exteriority: a “clothing.” It has sometimes been

 

contested that speech clothed thought. Husserl, Saussure, Lavelle have all questioned it. But

 

has it ever been doubted that writing was the clothing of speech? For Saussure it is even a

 

garment of perversion and debauchery, a dress of corruption and disguise, a festival mask that

 

must be exorcised, that is to say warded off, by the good word: “Writing veils the appearance

 

of language; it is not a guise for language but a dis-guise” (p. 51) [p. 3o]. Strange “image.”

 

One already suspects that if writing is “image” and exterior “figuration,” this “representation”

 

is not innocent. The outside bears with the inside a relationship that is, as usual, anything but

 

simple exteriority. The meaning of the outside was always present within the inside,

 

imprisoned outside the outside, and vice versa.

Thus a science of language must recover the 

natural—that 

is, the simple and original—

relationships between speech and writing, that is, between an inside and an outside. It must

 

restore its absolute youth, and the purity of its origin, short of a history and a fall which would

 

have perverted the rela

tionships between outside and inside. Therefore there would be a

 

natural order 

of relationships between linguistic and graphic signs, and it is the theoretician

 

of the arbitrariness of the sign who reminds us of it. According to the historico-metaphysical

 

presuppositions evoked above, there would be first a 

natural 

bond of sense to the senses and

 

it is this that passes from sense to sound: “the natural bond,” Saussure says, “the only true

 

bond, the bond of sound” (p. 46 [p. 25]. This natural bond of the signified (concept or sense)

 

to the phonic signifier would condition the natural relationship subordinating writing (visible

 

image) to speech. It is this natural relation-ship that would have been inverted by the original

 

sin of writing: “The graphic form 

[image] 

manages to force itself upon them at the expense of

 




sound . . . and the natural sequence is reversed” (p. 47) [p. 25]. Male-branche explained

 

original sin as inattention, the temptation of ease and idleness, by that 

nothing 

that was

 

Adam’s “distraction,” alone culpable before the innocence of the divine word: the latter

 

exerted no force, no efficacy, since 

nothing 

had taken place. Here too, one gave in to 

ease,

 

which is curiously, but as usual, on the side of technical artifice and not within the bent of the

 

natural movement thus thwarted or deviated:

First, the graphic form 

[image] 

of words strikes us as being something perma

nent and stable,

 

better suited than sound to constitute the unity of language throughout time. Though it creates

 

a purely 

fictitious 

unity, the 

superficial 

bond

((36))

of writing is much 

easier 

to grasp than the natural bond, the only true bond, the bond of sound

 

(p. 46; italics added) [p. 25].

That “the graphic form of words strikes us as being something perma

nent and stable, better

 

suited than sound to constitute the unity of lan

guage throughout time,” is that not a natural

 

phenomenon too? In fact a bad nature, “superficial” and “fictitious” and “easy,” effaces a

 

good nature by imposture; that which ties sense to sound, the “thought-sound.” Saus-sure is

 

faithful to the tradition that has always associated writing with the fatal violence of the

 

political institution. It is clearly a matter, as with Rousseau for example, of a break with

 

nature, of a usurpation that was coupled with the theoretical blindness to the natural essence

 

of language, at any rate to the natural bond between the “instituted signs” of the voice and

 

“the first language of man,” the “cry of nature” 

(Second Dis-course).* 

Saussure: “But the

 

spoken word is so intimately bound to its written 

image 

that the latter manages to 

usurp 

the

 

main role” (p. 45; italics added) [p. 24]. Rousseau: “Writing is nothing but the representation

 

of speech; it is 

bizarre 

that one gives more care to the determining of the 

image 

than to the

 

object.” 

Saussure: “Whoever says that a certain letter must be pronounced a certain way is

 

mistaking the written 

image 

of a sound for the sound itself. . . . [One] attribute[s] the oddity

 

[bizarrerie] 

to an exceptional pronunciation” (p. 52) [p. 3o] 2 What is intolerable and

 

fascinating is indeed the intimacy intertwining image and thing, 

graph, i.e., 

and phonè, to the

 

point where by a mirroring, inverting, and perverting effect, speech seems in its turn the

 

speculum of writing, which “manages to usurp the main role.” Representation mingles with

 

what it represents, to the point where one speaks as one writes, one thinks as if the represented

 

were nothing more than the shadow or reflecti’pn of the representer. A dangerous promiscuity

 

and a nefarious complicity\ between the reflection and the reflected which lets itself be

 

seduced narcissistically. In this play of repre

sentation, the point of origin becomes

 

ungraspable. There are things like reflecting pools, and images, an infinite reference from one

 

to the other, but no longer a source, a spring. There is no longer a simple origin. For what is

 

reflected is split 

in itself 

and not only as an addition to itself of its image. The reflection, the

 

image, the double, splits what it doubles. The origin of the speculation becomes a difference.

 

What can look at itself is not one; and the law of the addition of the origin to its

 

representation, of the thing to its image, is that one plus one makes at least three.

((37))

historical usurpation and theoretical oddity that install the image within the rights of reality

 

are determined as the 

forgetting 

of a simple origin. By Rousseau but also for Saussure. The

 

displacement is hardly anagram

matic: “The result is that people forget that they learn to speak

 

before they learn to write and the natural sequence is reversed” (p. 47) [p. 25]. The violence

 

of forgetting. Writing, a mnemotechnic means, supplanting good memory, spontaneous

 

memory, signifies forgetfulness. It is exactly what Plato said in the 

Phaedrus, 

comparing

 

writing to speech as 

hypomnesis 

to 

mnémè, 

the auxilliary aide-mémoire to the living memory.

 

Forgetfulness because it is a mediation and the departure of the logos from itself. Without

 

writing, the latter would remain in itself. Writing is the dissimulation of the natural, primary,

 

and immediate presence of sense to the soul within the logos. Its violence befalls the soul as

 

unconsciousness. Deconstructing this tradition will therefore not consist of reversing it, of

 

making writing innocent. Rather of showing why the violence of writing does not 

befall 

an

 

innocent language. There is an originary violence of writ-ing because language is first, in a

 

sense I shall gradually reveal, writing. “Usurpation” has always already begun. The sense of

 

the right side appears in a mythological effect of return.

“

The sciences and the arts” have elected to live within this violence, their “progress” has

 

consecrated forgetfulness and “corrupted manners

Saussure again anagrammatizes

 

Rousseau: “The literary lan

guage adds to the undeserved importance of writing. . . 

Thus

 

writing assumes undeserved importance 

[une importance à laquelle elle n’a pas droit]

 

» 

(p.

 

47) [p. 25]. 

When linguists become embroiled in a theoretical mistake in this subject, when

 

they are taken in, they are 

culpable, 

their fault is above all 

moral; 

they have yielded to

 

imagination, to sensibility, to passion, they have fallen into the “trap” (p. 46) [p. 25] of

 

writing, have let themselves be fascinated by the “influence 

[prestige] 

of the written form”

 

(ibid.), of that custom, that second nature. “The language does have a definite and stable oral

 

tradition that is independent of writing, but the influence 

[prestige] 

of the written from

 

prevents our seeing this.” We are thus not blind to the visible, but blinded by the visible,

 

dazzled by writing. “The first linguists confused language and writing, just as the humanists

 

had done before them. Even Bopp. . . . His immediate suc

cessors fell into the same trap.”

 

Rousseau had already addressed the same reproach to the Grammarians: “For the

 

Grammarians, the art of speech seems to be verv little more than the art of writing.” 3 As

 

usual, the “trap” is artifice dissimulated in nature. This explains why 

The Course in General

 

Linguistics 

treats 

first 

this strange external system that is writing. As neces

sary preamble to

 

restoring the natural to itself, one must first disassemble the trap. We read a little further on:

((38))

To substitute immediately what is natural for what is artificial would be neces

sary; but this is

 

impossible without first studying the sounds of what is language; detached from their graphic

 

signs, sounds represent only vague notions, and the prop provided by writing, though

 

deceptive, is still preferable. The first linguists, who knew nothing about the physiology of

 

articulated sounds, were constantly falling into a trap; to let go of the letter was for them to

 




lose their foothold; to me, it means a first step in the direction of truth (p. 55. Opening of the

 

chapter on Phonology) [p. 32].

For Saussure, to give in to the “prestige of the written form” is, as I have just said, to give in

 

to 

passion. It is 

passion—and I weigh my word—that Saussure analyzes and criticizes here, as

 

a moralist and a psychologist of a very old tradition. As one knows, passion is tyrannical and

 

enslaving: “Philological criticism is still deficient on one point: it follows the written language

 

slavishly and neglects the living language” (p. 14) [pp. 1-2]. “The tyranny of writing,”

 

Saussure says elsewhere (p. 53) [p. 31]. That tyranny is at bottom the mastery of the body

 

over the soul, and passion is a passivity and sickness of the soul, the moral perversion is

 

pathological. 

The reciprocal effect of writing on speech is “wrong 

[vicieuse],” 

Saussure says,

 

“such mistakes are really pathological” (p. 53) [p. 31]. The inversion of the natural

 

relationships would thus have engendered the perverse cult of the letter-image: sin of idolatry,

 

“superstition of the letter”’ Saussure says in the 

Anagrams 

4 where he has difficulty in

 

proving the existence of a “phoneme anterior to all writing.” The perversion of artifice

 

engenders monsters. Writing, like all artificial languages one would wish to fix and remove

 

from the living history of the natural language, participates in the monstrosity. It is a deviation

 

from nature. The characteristic of the Lieb

nizian type and Esperanto would be here in the

 

same position. Saussure’s irritation with such possibilities drives him to pedestrian

 

comparisons: “A man proposing a fixed language that posterity would have to accept for what

 

it is would be like a hen hatching a duck’s egg” (p. iii) [p. 76]. And Saussure wishes to save

 

not only the 

natural life 

of language, but the natural habits of writing. Spontaneous life must

 

be protected. Thus, the introduction of scientific exigencies and the taste for exactitude into

 

ordi

nary phonetic writing must be avoided. In this case, rationality would bring death,

 

desolation, and monstrousness. That is why common orthog

raphy must be kept away from the

 

notations of the linguist and 

the multi-plying of diacritical signs must be avoided:

Are there grounds for substituting a phonologic alphabet for a system 

[l’orthographe] 

already

 

in use? Here I can only broach this interesting subject. I think that phonological writing

 

should be for the use of linguists only. First, how would it be possible to make the English,

 

Germans, French, etc. adopt a uniform system! Next, an alphabet applicable to all languages

 

would probably be weighed down by diacritical marks; and—to say nothing of the distressing

((39))

appearance of a page of phonological writing—attempts to gain precision would obviously

 

confuse the reader by obscuring what the writing was designed to ex-press. The advantages

 

would not be sufficient to compensate for the incon

veniences. Phonological exactitude is not

 

very desirable outside science (p. 57) [P. 34].

I hope my intention is clear. I think Saussure’s reasons are good. I do not question, 

on the

 

level on which he says it, 

the truth of 

what Saussure says 

in such a tone. And as long as an

 

explicit problematics, a 

critique 

of the relationships between speech and writing, is not

 

elaborated, what he de

nounces as the blind prejudice of classical linguists or of common

 

experi

ence indeed remains a blind prejudice, on the basis of a general presupposi

tion which is

 

no doubt common to the accused and the prosecutor.

I would rather announce the limits and the presuppositions of what seems here to be self-

evident and what seems to me to retain the character and validity of evidence. The limits have

 

already begun to appear: Why does a project of 

general 

linguistics, concerning the 

internal

 




system in gen

eral of language in general, 

outline the limits of its field by excluding, as

 

exteriority in general, a particular 

system of writing, however important it might be, even

 

were it to be 

in fact 

universal? 5 A particular system which has precisely for its 

principle 

or at

 

least for its 

declared 

project to be ex

terior to the spoken language. Declaration of principle,

 

pious wish and historical violence of a speech dreaming its full self-presence, living itself as

 

its own resumption; self-proclaimed language, auto-production of a speech declared alive,

 

capable, Socrates said, of helping itself, a logos which be

lieves itself to be its own father,

 

being lifted thus above written discourse, 

infans 

(speechless) and infirm at not being able to

 

respond when one questions it and which, since its “parent[’s help] is [always] needed” (ton

 

patrbs aei deitai 

boithon—Phaedrus 

275d) must therefore be bom out of a primary gap and a

 

primary 

expatriation, 

condemning it to wandering and blindness, to mourning. Self-

proclaimed language but actually speech, de

luded into believing itself completely alive, and

 

violent, for it is not “capable of protect[ing] or defend[ing] [itself]” (dunatös men amenai

 

éauto) except through expelling the other, and especially 

its own 

other, throwing it 

outside 

and

 

below, 

under the name of writing. But however im-portant it might be, and were it in fact

 

universal or called upon to become so, that particular model which is phonetic writing 

does

 

not exist; 

no prac

tice is ever totally faithful to its principle. Even before speaking, as I shall do

 

further on, of a radical and a priori necessary infidelity, one can already remark its massive

 

phenomena in mathematical script or in punctu

ation, in 

spacing 

in general, which it is

 

difficult to consider as simple accessories of writing. That a speech supposedly alive can lend

 

itself to spacing in its own writing is what relates it originarily to its own death.

Finally, the “usurpation” of which Saussure speaks, the violence by

((40))

which writing would substitute itself for its own origin, for that which ought not only to have

 

engendered it but to have been engendered from itself—such a reversal of power cannot be an

 

accidental aberration. Usurpa

tion necessarily refers us to a profound possibility of essence.

 

This is with-out a doubt inscribed within speech itself and he should have questioned it,

 

perhaps even started from it.

Saussure confronts the system of the spoken language with the system of phonetic (and even

 

alphabetic) writing as though with the telos of writing. This teleology leads to the

 

interpretation of all eruptions of the nonphonetic within writing as transitory crisis and

 

accident of passage, and it is right to consider this teleology to be a Western ethnocentrism, a

 

premathematical primitivism, and a preformalist intuitionism. Even if this teleology responds

 

to some absolute necessity, it should be problematized as such. The scandal of “usurpation”

 

invites us expressly and intrinsically to do that. How was the trap and the usurpation possible?

 

Saussure never replies to this question beyond a psychology of the passions or of the

 

imagination; a psychology reduced to its most conventional diagrams. This best explains why

 

all linguistics, a determined sector inside semiology, is placed under the authority and

 

superiority of psychology: “To determine the exact place of semiology is the task of the

 

psychologist” (p. 33) [p. i6]. The affirmation of the essential and “natural” bond between the

 

phone 

and the sense, the privilege accorded to an order of signifier (which then becomes the

 

major signified of all other signifiers) depend expressly, and in con

tradiction to the other

 

levels of the Saussurian discourse, upon a psychology of consciousness and of intuitive

 

consciousness. ‘What Saussure does not question here is the essential possibility of

 

nonintuition. Like Husserl, Saus-sure determines this nonintuition teleologically as 

crisis. 

The

 

empty 

sym

bolism of the written notation—in mathematical technique for example—is also for

 




Husserlian intuitionism that which exiles us far from the 

clear 

evidence of the sense, that is to

 

say from the full presence of the signified in its truth, and thus opens the possibility of crisis.

 

This is indeed a crisis of the logos. Nevertheless, for Husserl, this possibility remains linked

 

with the very moment of truth and the production of ideal objectivity: it has in fact an

 

essential need for writing. 6 By one entire aspect of his text, Husserl makes us think that the

 

negativity of the crisis is not a mere accident. But it is then the concept of crisis that should be

 

suspect, by virtue of what ties it to a dialectical and teleological determination of negativity.

On the other hand, to account for “usurpation” and the origin of “pas

sion,” the classical and

 

very superficial argument of the solid permanence of the written thing, not to be simply false,

 

calls forth descriptions which are precisely no longer within the province of psychology.

 

Psychology will never be able to accommodate within its space that which constitutes the

 

absence of the signatory, to say nothing of the absence of the referent.

((41))

Writing is the name of these two absences. Besides, is it not contradictory to what is

 

elsewhere affirmed about language having “a- definite and [far more] stable oral tradition that

 

is independent of writing” (p. 46) [p. 24], to explain the usurpation by means of writing’s

 

power of 

duration, 

by means of the 

durability 

of the substance of writing? If these two

 

“stabili

ties” were of the same nature, and if the stability of the spoken language were superior

 

and independent, the origin of writing, its “prestige” and its supposed harmfulness, would

 

remain an inexplicable mystery. It seems then as if Saussure wishes 

at the same time 

to

 

demonstrate the corruption of speech by writing, to denounce the harm that the latter does to

 

the former, 

and 

to underline the inalterable and natural independence of language.

 

“Languages are independent of writing” (p. 45) [p. 24]. Such is the truth of nature. And yet

 

nature is affected—from without—by an overturning which modifies it in its interior,

 

denatures it and obliges it to be separated from itself. Nature denaturing itself, being separated

 

from itself, 

naturally gathering its outside into its inside, is 

catastrophe, 

a natural event that

 

over-throws nature, or 

monstrosity, a 

natural deviation within nature. The func

tion assumed in

 

Rousseau’s discourse by the catastrophe (as we shall see), is here delegated to monstrousness.

 

Let us cite the entire conclusion of Chapter VI of the 

Course 

(

“

Graphic Representation of

 

Language”), which must be compared to Rousseau’s text on 

Pronunciation:

But the tyranny of writing goes even further. By imposing itself upon the masses, spelling

 

influences and modifies language. This happens only in highly literary languages where

 

written texts play an important role. Then visual images lead to wrong 

[vicieuses]

 

pronunciations; such mistakes are really pathological. Spelling practices cause mistakes in the

 

pronunciation of many French words. For in-stance, there were two spellings for the surname

 

Lefèvre (from latin 

faber), 

one popular and simple, the other learned and etymological:

 

Lefèvre 

and 

Lefèbvre. 

Because v and 

u 

were not kept apart in the old system of writing,

 

Lefèbvre 

was read as 

Lefébure, 

with a 

b 

that has never really existed and a u that was the

 

result of ambiguity. Now, the latter form is actually pronounced (pp. 53—54) [p.31].

‘

Where is the evil? one will perhaps ask. And what has been invested in the “living word,”

 

that makes such “aggressions” of writing intolerable? What investment begins by determining

 

the constant action of writing as a deformation and an aggression? What prohibition has thus

 

been trans

gressed? Where is the sacrilege? Why should the mother tongue be pro

tected from

 

the operation of writing? Why determine that operation as a violence, and why should the

 

transformation be only a deformation? Why should the mother tongue not have a history, or,

 




what comes to the same thing, produce its own history in a perfectly natural, autistic, and

 

domestic way, without ever being affected by any outside? Why wish to punish writ-ing for a

 

monstrous crime, to the point of wanting to reserve for it, even

((42))

within scientific treatments, a “special compartment” that holds it at a distance? For it is

 

indeed within a sort of intralinguistic leper colony that Saussure wants to contain and

 

concentrate the problem of deformations through writing. And, in order to be convinced that

 

he would take in very bad part the innocent questions that I have just asked—for after all

 

Lefé

bure is not a bad name 

and we can love this play—let us read the following. The passage

 

below explains to us that the “play” is not “natural,” and its accents are pessimistic:

 

“Mispronunciations due to spelling will probably appear more frequently and as time goes on,

 

the number of useless letters pronounced by speakers will probably increase.” As in Rousseau

 

in the same context, the Capital is accused: “Some Parisians already pronounce the 

t 

in 

sept

 

femmes ‘

seven women’.” Strange example. The historical gap —for it is indeed history that

 

one must stop in order to protect language from writing—will only widen:

Darmsteter foresees the day when even the last two letters of 

vingt 

“twenty” will be

 

pronounced—truly an orthographic 

monstrosity. 

Such phonic 

deforma

tions 

belong to

 

language but do 

not stem from its natural functioning. 

They are due to an 

external 

influence.

 

Linguistics should put them into 

a special compartment 

for observation: they are

 

teratological 

cases (p. 54; italics added) [PP- P-32].

It is clear that the concepts of stability, permanence, and duration, which here assist thinking

 

the relationships between speech and writing, are too lax and open to every uncritical

 

investiture. They would require more attentive and minute analyses. The same is applicable to

 

an explana

tion according to which “most people pay more attention to visual impres

sions

 

simply because these are sharper and more lasting than aural impres

sions” (p. 46) [p. 25].

 

This explanation of “usurpation” is not only empirical in its form, it is problematic in its

 

content, it refers to a meta-physics and to an old physiology of sensory faculties constantly

 

disproved by science, as by the experience of language and by the body proper as lan

guage. It

 

imprudently makes of visibility the tangible, simple, and essential element of writing. Above

 

all, in considering the audible as the 

natural 

milieu within which language must 

naturally

 

fragment and articulate its instituted signs, thus exercising its arbitrariness, this explanation

 

excludes all possibility of some natural relationship between speech and writing at the very

 

moment that it affirms it. Instead of deliberately dismissing the notions of nature and

 

institution that it constantly uses, which ought to be done first, it thus confuses the two. It

 

finally and most importantly con

tradicts the principal affirmation according to which “the

 

thing that con

stitutes language 

[l’essentiel de la langue] is ... 

unrelated to the phonic character

 

of the linguistic sign” (p. 21) [p. 7]. This affirmation will soon

((43))

occupy us; within it the other side of the Saussurian proposition denounc

ing the “illusions of

 

script” comes to the fore.

What do these limits and presuppositions signify? First that a linguistics is not 

general 

as long

 

as it defines its outside and inside in terms of 

deter-mined 

linguistic models; as long as it does

 

not rigorously distinguish essence from fact in their respective degrees of generality. The

 




system of writing in general is not exterior to the system of language in general, unless it is

 

granted that the division between exterior and interior passes through the interior of the

 

interior or the exterior of the exterior, to the point where the immanence of language is

 

essentially exposed to the intervention of forces that are apparently alien to its system. For the

 

same reason, writing in general is not “image” or “figuration” of language in general, except

 

if the nature, the logic, and the functioning of the image within the system from which one

 

wishes to exclude it be reconsidered. Writing is not a sign of a sign, except if one says it of all

 

signs, which would be more profoundly true. If every sign refers to a sign, and if “sign of a

 

sign” signifies writing, certain conclusions—which I shall consider at the appropriate moment

—will become inevitable. What Saussure saw without seeing, knew without being 

able 

to

 

take into account, following in that the entire metaphysical tradition, is that a certain model of

 

writing was necessarily but provisionally imposed (but for the inaccuracy in principle,

 

insufficiency of fact, and the permanent usurpation) as instrument and technique of

 

representation of a system of language. And that this movement, unique in style, was so pro-

found that it permitted the thinking, 

within language, 

of concepts like those of the sign,

 

technique, representation, language. The system of language as

sociated with phonetic-

alphabetic writing is that within which logocentric metaphysics, determining the sense of

 

being as presence, has been pro

duced. This logocentrism, this 

epoch 

of the full speech, has

 

always placed in parenthesis, 

suspended, 

and suppressed for essential reasons, all free

 

reflection on the origin and status of writing, all science of writing which was not 

technology

 

and the 

history of a technique, 

itself leaning upon a mythology and a metaphor of a natural

 

writing.* It is this logocentrism which, limiting the internal system of language in general by

 

a bad ab

straction, prevents Saussure and the majority of his successors 7 from de

termining

 

fully and explicitly that which is called “the integral and concrete object of linguistics” (p. 23)

 

[p. 7].

But conversely, as I announced above, it is when he is not expressly dealing with writing,

 

when he feels he has closed the parentheses on that subject, that Saussure opens the field of a

 

general grammatology. Which

“putting out of play” that constitutes phenomenological reduction.

xxx fotnote slutt xxx

((44))

would not only no longer be excluded from general linguistics, but would dominate it and

 

contain it within itself. Then one realizes that what was chased off limits, the wandering

 

outcast of linguistics, has indeed never ceased to haunt language as its primary and most

 

intimate possibility. Then something which was never spoken and which is nothing other’

 

than writing itself as the origin of language writes itself within Saussure’s discourse. Then we

 

glimpse the germ of a profound but indirect explanation of the usurpation and the traps

 

condemned in Chapter VI. This explanation will overthrow even the form of the question to

 

which it was a premature reply.

The Outside [Is med kryss] the Inside




The thesis of the 

arbitrariness 

of the sign (so grossly misnamed, and not only for the reasons

 

Saussure himself recognizes) 8 must forbid a radical distinction between the linguistic and the

 

graphic sign. No doubt this thesis concerns only the necessity of relationships between

 

specific sig

nifiers and signifieds 

within 

an allegedly natural relationship between the voice

 

and sense in general, between the order of phonic signifiers and the content of the signifieds

 

(“the only natural bond, the only true bond, the bond of sound”). Only these relationships

 

between specific signifiers and signifieds would be regulated by arbitrariness. Within the

 

“natural” rela

tionship between phonic signifiers and their signifieds 

in general, 

the rela

-

tionship between each determined signifier and its determined signified would be “arbitrary.”

Now from the moment that one considers the totality of determined signs, spoken, and a

 

fortiori written, as unmotivated institutions, one must exclude any relationship of natural

 

subordination, any natural hierarchy among signifiers or orders of signifiers. If “writing”

 

signifies inscription and especially the durable institution of a sign (and that is the only

 

irreducible kernel of the concept of writing), writing in general covers the entire field of

 

linguistic signs. In that field a certain sort of instituted signifiers may then appear, “graphic”

 

in the narrow and derivative sense of the word, ordered by a certain relationship with other

 

instituted—hence “written,” even if they are “phonic”—signifiers. The very idea of institution

—hence of the arbitrariness of the sign—is unthinkable before the possibility of writing and

 

outside of its horizon. Quite simply, that is, outside of the horizon itself, outside the world as

 

space of inscription, as the opening to the emission and to the spatial 

distribution 

of signs, to

 

the 

regulated play 

of their differences, even if they are “phonic.”

Let us now persist in using this opposition of nature and institution, of 

physis 

and 

nomos

 

(which also means, of course, a distribution and division regulated in fact by 

law) 

which a

 

meditation on writing should disturb al-

((45))

though it functions everywhere as self-evident, particularly in the discourse of linguistics. We

 

must then conclude that only the signs called 

natural, 

those that Hegel and Saussure call

 

“symbols,” escape semiology as gram

matology. But they fall a fortiori outside the field of

 

linguistics as the region of general semiology. The thesis of the arbitrariness of the sign thus

 

indi

rectly but irrevocably contests Saussure’s declared proposition when he chases writing to

 

the outer darkness of language. This thesis successfully accounts for a conventional

 

relationship between the phoneme and the grapheme (in phonetic writing, between the

 

phoneme, signifier-signified, and the grapheme, pure signifier), but by the same token it

 

forbids that the latter be an “image” of the former. Now it was indispensable to the exclusion

 

of writing as “external system,” that it come to impose an “image,” a “representaton,” or a

 

“figuration,” an exterior reflection of the reality of language.

It matters little, here at least, that there is in fact an ideographic filia

tion of the alphabet. This

 

important question is much debated by historians of writing. What matters here is that in the

 

synchronic structure and syste

matic principle of alphabetic writing—and phonetic writing in

 

general—no relationship of “natural” representation, none of resemblance or par

ticipation, no

 

“symbolic” relationship in the Hegelian–Saussurian sense, no “iconographic” relationship in

 

the Peircian sense, be implied.

One must therefore challenge, in the very name of the arbitrariness of the sign, the Saussurian

 

definition of writing as “image”—hence as natural symbol—of language. Not to mention the

 




fact that the phoneme is the 

unimaginable 

itself, and no visibility can 

resemble 

it, it suffices to

 

take into account what Saussure says about the difference between the symbol and the sign (p.

 

ioi) [pp. 68–69] in order to be completely baffled as to how he can at the same time say of

 

writing that it is an “image” or “figuration” of language and define language and writing

 

elsewhere as “two distinct systems of signs” (p. 45) [p. 23]. For the property of the sign is not

 

to be an image. By a process exposed by Freud in 

The Interpretation of Dreams, 

Saussure

 

thus accumulates contradictory arguments to bring about a satis-factory decision: the

 

exclusion of writing. In fact, even within so-called phonetic writing, the “graphic” signifier

 

refers to the phoneme through a web of many dimensions which binds it, like all signifiers, to

 

other written and oral signifiers, within a “total” system open, let us say, to all possible

 

investments of sense. We must begin with the possibility of that total system.

Saussure was thus never able to think that writing was truly an “image,” a “figuration,” a

 

“representation” of the spoken language, a symbol. If one considers that he nonetheless

 

needed these inadequate notions to decide upon the exteriority of writing, one must conclude

 

that an entire stratum of his discourse, the intention of Chapter VI (“Graphic Representation

 

of Language”), was not at all scientific. When I say this, my quarry is not

((46))

primarily Ferdinand de Saussure’s intention or motivation, but rather the entire uncritical

 

tradition which he inherits. To what zone of discourse does this strange functioning of

 

argumentation belong, this coherence of desire producing itself in a near-oneiric way—

although it clarifies the dream rather than allow itself to be clarified by it—through

 

a•contradictory logic? How is this functioning articulated with the entirety of theoretical

 

discourse, throughout the history of science? Better yet, how does it work from within the

 

concept of science itself? It is only when this question is elaborated—if it is some day—when

 

the concepts required by this functioning are de-fined outside of all psychology (as of all

 

sciences of man), outside meta-physics (which can now be “Marxist” or “structuralist”); when

 

one is able to respect all its levels of generality and articulation—it is only then that one will

 

be able to state rigorously the problem of the articulated appurte

nance of a text (theoretical or

 

otherwise) to an entire set: I obviously treat the Saussurian text at the moment only as a telling

 

example within a given situation, without professing to use the concepts required by the

 

functioning of which I have just spoken. My justification would be as fol-lows: this and some

 

other indices (in a general way the treatment of the concept of writing) already give us the

 

assured means of broaching the de-construction 

of the greatest totality—the 

concept of the

 

epistémè 

and logocentric metaphysics—within which are produced, without ever posing the

 

radical question of writing, all the Western methods of analysis, explica

tion, reading, or

 

interpretation.

Now we must think that writing is at the same time more exterior to speech, not being its

 

“image” or its “symbol,” and more interior to speech, which is already in itself a writing.

 

Even before it is linked to incision, en-graving, drawing, or the letter, to a signifier referring in

 

general to a signifier signified by it, the concept of the 

graphie 

[unit of a possible graphic

 

system] implies the framework of the 

instituted trace, 

as the possibility common to all

 

systems of signification. My efforts will now be directed toward slowly detaching these two

 

concepts from the classical discourse from which I necessarily borrow them. The effort will

 

be laborious and we know a priori that its effectiveness will never be pure and absolute.




The instituted trace is “unmotivated” but not capricious. Like the word “arbitrary” according

 

to Saussure, it “should not imply that the choice of the signifier is left entirely to the speaker”

 

(p. ioi) [pp. 68-69]. Simply, it has no “natural attachment” to the signified within reality. For

 

us, the rupture of that “natural attachment” puts in question the idea of natural

ness rather than

 

that of attachment. That is why the word “institution” should not be too quickly interpreted

 

within the classical system of oppositions.

The instituted trace cannot be thought without thinking the retention of difference within a

 

structure of reference where difference appears as

((47))

such 

and thus permits a certain liberty of variations among the full terms. The absence of

 

another 

here-and-now, of another transcendental present, of 

another 

origin of the world

 

appearing as such, presenting itself as ir-reducible absence within the presence of the trace, is

 

not a metaphysical formula substituted for a scientific concept of writing. This formula,

 

beside the fact that it is the questioning of metaphysics itself, describes the structure implied

 

by the “arbitrariness of the sign,” from the moment that one thinks of its possibility 

short of

 

the derived opposition between nature and convention, symbol and sign, etc. These

 

oppositions have meaning only after the possibility of the trace. The “unmotivatedness” of the

 

sign re-quires a synthesis in which the completely other is announced as such—without any

 

simplicity, any identity, any resemblance or continuity—within what is not it. 

Is announced as

 

such: 

there we have all 

history, 

from what metaphysics has defined as “non-living” up to

 

“consciousness,” passing through all levels of animal organization. The trace, where the

 

relationship with the other is marked, articulates its possibility in the entire field of the entity

 

[étant], 

which metaphysics has defined as the being-present starting from the occulted

 

movement of the trace. The trace must be thought before the entity. But the movement of the

 

trace is necessarily occulted, it produces itself as self-occultation. When the other announces

 

itself as such, it presents itsef in the dissimulation of itself. This formulation is not

 

theological, as one might believe somewhat hastily. The “theological” is a determined

 

moment in the total movement of the trace. The field of the entity, before being determined as

 

the field of presence, is structured ac-cording to the diverse possibilities—genetic and

 

structural—of the trace. The presentation of the other as such, that is to say the dissimulation

 

of its “as such,” has always already begun and no structure of the entity escapes it.

That is why the movement of “unmotivatedness” passes from one struc

ture to the other when

 

the “sign” crosses the stage of the “symbol.” It is in a certain sense and according to a certain

 

determined structure of the “as such” that one is authorized to say that there is yet no

 

immotivation in ,what Saussure calls “symbol” and which, according to him, does not—at

 

least provisionally—interest semiology. The general structure of the un-motivated trace

 

connects within the same possibility, and they cannot be separated except by abstraction, the

 

structure of the relationship with the other, the movement of temporalization, and language as

 

writing. Without referring back to a “nature,” the immotivation of the trace has always

 

become. 

In fact, there is no unmotivated trace: the trace is indefi

nitely its own becoming-

unmotivated. In Saussurian language, what Saus-sure does not say would have to be said:

 

there is neither symbol nor sign but a becoming-sign of the symbol.

Thus, as it goes without saying, the trace whereof I speak is not more

((48))




natural 

(it is not the mark, the natural sign, or the index in the Hus

serlian sense) than 

cultural,

 

not more physical than psychic, biological than spiritual. It is that starting from which a

 

becoming-unmotivated of the sign, and with it all the ulterior oppositions between 

physis 

and

 

its other, is possible.

In his project of semiotics, Peirce seems to have been more attentive than Saussure to the

 

irreducibility of this becoming-unmotivated. In his termi

nology, one must speak of a

 

becoming-unmotivated of the 

symbol, 

the notion of the symbol playing here a role analogous

 

to that of the sign which Saussure opposes precisely to the symbol:

Symbols grow. They come into being by development out of other signs, par

ticularly from

 

icons, or from mixed signs partaking of the nature of icons and symbols. We think only in

 

signs. These mental signs are of mixed nature; the symbol parts of them are called concepts. If

 

a man makes a new symbol, it is by thoughts involving concepts. So it is only out of symbols

 

that a new symbol can grow. Omne symbolum de symbolo. 9

Peirce complies with two apparently incompatible exigencies. The mis-take here would be to

 

sacrifice one for the other. It must be recognized that the symbolic (in Peirce’s sense: of “the

 

arbitrariness of the sign”) is rooted in the nonsymbolic, in an anterior and related order of

 

significa

tion: “Symbols grow. They come into being by development out of other signs,

 

particularly from icons, or from mixed signs.” But these roots must not compromise the

 

structural originality of the field of symbols, the autonomy of a domain, a production, and a

 

play: “So it is only out of symbols that a new symbol can grow. Omne symbolum de

 

symbolo.”

But in both cases, the genetic root-system refers .from sign to sign. No ground of

 

nonsignification—understood as insignificance or an intuition of a present truth—stretches

 

out to give it foundation under the play and the coming into being of signs. Semiotics no

 

longer depends on logic. Logic, according to Peirce, is only a semiotic: “Logic, in its general

 

sense, is, as I believe I have shown, only another name for semiotics 

(semeiotike), 

the quasi-

necessary, or formal, doctrine of signs.” And logic in the classical sense, logic “properly

 

speaking,” nonformal logic commanded by the value of truth, occupies in that semiotics only

 

a determined and not a funda

mental level. As in Husserl (but the analogy, although it is most

 

thought-provoking, would stop there and one must apply it carefully), the lowest level, the

 

foundation of the possibility of logic (or semiotics) corresponds to the project of the

 

Grammatica speculativa 

of Thomas d’Erfurt, falsely attributed to Duns Scotus. Like Husserl,

 

Peirce expressly refers to it. It is a matter of elaborating, in both cases, a formal doctrine of

 

conditions which a discourse must satisfy in order to have a sense, in order to “mean,” even

((49))

if it is false or contradictory. The general morphology of that meaning 10 

(Bedeutung,

 

vouloir-dire) 

is independent of all logic of truth.

The science of semiotic has three branches. The first is called by Duns Scotus 

grammatica

 

speculativa. 

We may term it 

pure grammar. 

It has for its task to ascertain what must be true of

 

the representamen used by every scientific intelli

gence in order that they may embody any

 

meaning. 

The second is logic proper. It is the science of what is quasi-necessarily true of the

 

representamina of any scientific intelligence in order that they may hold good of 

any object,

 

that is, may be true. Or say, logic proper is the formal science of the conditions of the truth of

 




representations.. The third, in imitation of Kant’s fashion of preserving old associations of

 

words in finding nomenclature for new conceptions, I call 

pure rhetoric. 

Its task is to ascertain

 

the laws by which in every scientific intelli

gence one sign gives birth to another, and

 

especially one thought brings forth another. 11

Peirce goes very far in the direction that I have called the de-construction of the

 

transcendental signified, which, at one time or another, would place a reassuring end to the

 

reference from sign to sign. I have identified logocentrism and the metaphysics of presence as

 

the exigent, powerful, systematic, and irrepressible desire for such a signified. Now Peirce

 

con-siders the indefiniteness of reference as the criterion that allows us to recognize that we

 

are indeed dealing with a system of signs. 

What broaches the movement of signification is

 

what makes its interruption impossible. The thing itself is a sign. 

An unacceptable proposition

 

for Husserl, whose phenomenology remains therefore—in its “principle of principles”—the

 

most radical and most critical restoration of the metaphysics of presence. The difference

 

between Husserl’s and Peirce’s phenomenologies is funda

mental since it concerns the concept

 

of the sign and of the manifestation of presence, the relationships between the re-presentation

 

and the originary presentation of the thing itself (truth). On this point Peirce is un

doubtedly

 

closer to the inventôr of the word 

phenomenology: 

Lambert proposed in fact to “reduce 

the

 

theory of things 

to the 

theory of signs.” 

Ac-cording to the “phaneoroscopy” or

 

“phenomenology” of Peirce, 

manifesta

tion 

itself does not reveal a presence, it makes a sign.

 

One may read in the 

Principle of Phenomenology 

that “the idea of 

manifestation 

is the idea of

 

a sign.” 12 There is thus no phenomenality reducing the sign or the repre

senter so that the

 

thing signified may be allowed to glow finally in the luminosity of its presence. The so-called

 

“thing itself” is always already a 

representamen 

shielded from the simplicity of intuitive

 

evidence. The 

representamen 

functions only by giving rise to an 

interpretant 

that itself

 

becomes a sign and so on to infinity. The self-identity of the signified conceals itself

 

unceasingly and is always on the move. The property of the 

representamen 

is to be itself and

 

another, to be produced as a structure of

((50))

reference, to be separated from itself. The property of the 

representamen 

is not to be 

proper

 

[propre], 

that is to say absolutely 

proximate 

to itself 

(prope, proprius). 

The 

represented 

is

 

always already a 

representamen. 

Definition of the sign:

Anything which determines something else (its interpretant) to refer to an object to which

 

itself refers (its object) in the same way, this interpretant be-coming in turn a sign, and so on

 

ad infinitum. . . . 

If the series of successive interpretants comes to an end, the sign is thereby

 

rendered imperfect, at least 13

From the moment that there is meaning there are nothing but signs. We 

think only in signs.

 

Which amounts to ruining the notion of the sign at the very moment when, as in Nietzsche, its

 

exigency is recognized in the abso

luteness of its right. One could call 

play 

the absence of the

 

transcendental signified as limitlessness of play, that is to say as the destruction of onto-

theology and the metaphysics of presence. It is not surprising that the shock, shaping and

 

undermining metaphysics since its origin, lets itself 

be named as such 

in the period when,

 

refusing to bind linguistics to semantics (which all European linguists, from Saussure to

 

Hjemslev, still do), expelling the problem of 

meaning 

outside of their researches, certain

 

American linguists constantly refer to the model of a game. Here one must think of writing as

 

a game within language. (The 

Phaedrus (277e) 

condemned writing pre

cisely as play—paidia




—and opposed such childishness to the adult gravity 

[spoudè] 

of speech). This 

play, 

thought

 

as absence of the transcendental signified, is not a play 

in the world, 

as it has always been

 

defined, for the purposes of 

containing 

it, by the philosophical tradition and as the theoreti

-

cians of play also consider it (or those who, following and going beyond Bloomfield, refer

 

semantics to psychology or some other local discipline). To think play radically the

 

ontological and transcendental problematics must first be seriously 

exhausted; 

the question of

 

the meaning of being, the being of the entity and of the transcendental origin of the world—of

 

the world-ness of the world—must be patiently and rigorously worked through, the critical

 

movement of the Husserlian and Heideggerian ques

tions must be effectively followed to the

 

very end, and their effectiveness and legibility must be conserved. Even if it were crossed out,

 

without it the concepts of play and writing to which I shall have recourse will remain caught

 

within regional limits and an empiricist, positivist, or metaphysical discourse. The counter-

move that the holders of such a discourse would oppose to the precritical tradition and to

 

metaphysical speculation would be nothing but the worldly representation of their own

 

operation. It is there-fore 

the game of the world 

that must be first thought; before attempting

 

to understand all the forms of play in the world.14

From the very opening of the game, then, we are within the becoming-unmotivated of the

 

symbol. With regard to this becoming, the opposition of diachronic and synchronic is also

 

derived. It would not be able to corn-

((51))

mand a grammatology pertinently. The immotivation of the trace ought now to be understood

 

as an operation and not as a state, as an active move-ment, a demotivation, and not as a given

 

structure. Science of “the arbi

trariness of the sign,” science of the immotivation of the trace,

 

science of writing before speech and in speech, grammatology would thus cover a vast field

 

within which linguistics would, by abstraction, delineate its own area, with the limits that

 

Saussure prescribes to its internal system and which must be carefully reexamined in each

 

speech/writing system in the world and history.

By a substitution which would be anything but verbal, one may replace 

semiology by

 

grammatology 

in the program of the 

Course in General Linguistics:

I shall call it [grammatology] .... Since the science does not yet exist, no one can say what it

 

would be; but it has a right to existence, a place staked out in advance. Linguistics is only a

 

part of [that] general science . . . ; the laws dis-covered by [grammatology] will be applicable

 

to linguistics. (p. 33) [p. 16].

The advantage of this substitution will not only be to give to the theory of writing the scope

 

needed to counter logocentric repression and the subordination to linguistics. It will liberate

 

the semiological project itself from what, in spite of its greater theoretical extension, remained

 

governed 

by linguistics, organized as if linguistics were at once its center and its telos. 

Even

 

though semiology was in fact more general and more comprehensive than linguistics, it

 

continued to be regulated as if it were one 

of 

the areas of linguistics. The linguistic sign

 

remained exemplary for semiology, 

it dominated it as the master-sign and as the generative

 

model: the pattern 

[patron].

One could therefore say that signs that are wholly arbitrary realize better than the others the

 

ideal of the semiological process; that is why language, the most complex and universal of all

 




systems of expression, is also the most char

acteristic; in this sense linguistics can become 

the

 

master-pattern for all branches 

of 

semiology 

although language is only one particular

 

semiological system (p. lor; italics added) [p. 68].

Consequently, reconsidering the order of dependence prescribed by Saussure, apparently

 

inverting the relationship of the part to the whole, Barthes in fact carries out the profoundest

 

intention of the 

Course:

From now on we must admit the possibility of reversing Saussure’s proposition some day:

 

linguistics is not a part, even if privileged, of the general science of signs, it is semiology that

 

is a part of linguistics.15

This coherent reversal, submitting semiology to a “translinguistics,” leads to its full

 

explication a linguistics historically dominated by logo-centric metaphysics, for which in fact

 

there is not and there should not be

((52))

“

any meaning except as named” (ibid.). Dominated by the so-called “civilization of writing”

 

that we inhabit, a civilization of so-called phonetic writing, that is to say of the logos where

 

the sense of being is, in its telos, determined as parousia. The Barthesian reversal is fecund

 

and indispensable for the description of the 

fact and the vocation of signification 

within the

 

closure of this epoch and this civilization that is in the process of disappearing in its very

 

globalization.

Let us now try to go beyond these formal and architectonic considera

tions. Let us ask in a

 

more intrinsic and concrete way, how language is not merely a sort of writing, “comparable to

 

a system of writing” (p. 33) [p. 16] —Saussure writes curiously—but a species 

of 

writing. Or

 

rather, since writ-ing no longer relates to language as an extension or frontier, let us ask how

 

language is a possibility founded on the general possibility of writing. Demonstrating this,

 

one would give at the same time an account of that alleged “usurpation” which could not be

 

an unhappy accident. It supposes on the contrary a common root and thus excludes the

 

resemblance of the “image,” derivation, or representative reflexion. And thus one would bring

 

back to its true meaning, to its primary possibility, the apparently innocent and didactic

 

analogy which makes Saussure say:

Language is [comparable to] a system of signs that express ideas, and is therefore 

comparable

 

to writing, 

the alphabet of deaf-mutes, symbolic rites, polite for

mulas, military signals, etc.

 

But it is the most important of all these systems (p. 33; italics added) [p. 16].

Further, it is not by chance that, a hundred and thirty pages later, at the moment of explaining

 

phonic difference 

as the condition of linguistic 

value 

(“from a material viewpoint”), 16 he

 

must again borrow all his peda

gogic resources from the example of writing:

Since an identical state of affairs is observable in writing, another system of signs, we shall

 

use writing to draw some comparisons that will clarify the whole issue (p.165) [p.119].

Four demonstrative items, borrowing pattern and content from writing, follow. 17




Once more, then, we definitely have to oppose Saussure to himself. Be-fore being or not

 

being “noted,” “represented,” “figured,” in a 

“graphie,” 

the linguistic sign implies an

 

originary writing. Henceforth, it is not to the thesis of the arbitrariness of the sign that I shall

 

appeal directly, but to what Saussure associates with it as an indispensable correlative and

 

which would seem to me rather to lay the foundations for it: the thesis of 

dif

ference 

as the

 

source of linguistic value. 18

What are, from the grammatological point of view, the consequences of

((53))

this theme that is now so well-known (and upon which Plato already re

flected in the

 

Sophist) ?

By definition, difference is never in itself a sensible plenitude. Therefore, its necessity

 

contradicts the allegation of a naturally phonic essence of language. It contests by the same

 

token the professed natural dependence of the graphic signifier. That is a consequence

 

Saussure himself draws against the premises defining the internal system of language. He

 

must now exclude the very thing which had permitted him to exclude writing: sound and its

 

“natural bond” 

[lien naturel] 

with meaning. For example: “The thing that constitutes language

 

is, as I shall show later, unrelated to the phonic character of the linguistic sign” (p. 21) [p. 7].

 

And in a paragraph on difference:

It is impossible for sound alone, a material element, to belong to language. It is only a

 

secondary thing, substance to be put to use. All our conventional values have the

 

characteristic of not being confused with the tangible element which supports them. . . . The

 

linguistic signifier . . . is not [in essence] phonic but incorporeal—constituted not by its

 

material substance but the differences that separate its sound-image from all others (p. 164)

 

[pp. 118-19]. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the

 

other signs that surround it (p. 166) [p. 120]

Without this reduction of phonic matter, the distinction between lan

guage and speech,

 

decisive for Saussure, would have no rigor. It would be the same for the oppositions that

 

happened to descend from it: between code and message, pattern and usage, etc. Conclusion:

 

“Phonology—this bears repeating—is only an auxiliary discipline [of the science of lan

guage]

 

and belongs exclusively to speaking” (p. 56) [p. 33]. Speech thus draws from this stock of

 

writing, noted or not, that language is, and it is here that one must meditate upon the

 

complicity between the two “sta

bilities.” The reduction of the 

phone 

reveals this complicity.

 

What Saus-sure says, for example, about the sign in general and what he “confirms” through

 

the example of writing, applies also to language: “Signs are gov

erned by a principle of

 

general semiology: continuity in time is coupled to change in time; this is confirmed by

 

orthrographic systems, the speech of deaf-mutes, etc.” (p. 111) [p. 16].

The reduction of phonic substance thus does not only permit the dis

tinction between phonetics

 

on the one hand (and a fortiori accoustics or the physiology of the phonating organs) and

 

phonology on the other. It also makes of phonology itself an “auxiliary discipline.” Here the

 

direction indicated by Saussure takes us beyond the phonologism of those who pro-fess to

 

follow him on this point: in fact, Jakobson believes indifference to the phonic substance of

 

expression to be impossible and illegitimate. He thus criticizes the glossematics of Hjelmslev

 

which requires and practices




((54))

the neutralizing of sonorous substance. And in the text cited above, Jakob-son and Halle

 

maintain that the “theoretical requirement” of a research of invariables placing sonorous

 

substance in parenthesis (as an empirical and contingent content) is:

1. 

impracticable 

since, as “Eli Fischer-Jorgensen exposes [it],” “the sonorous substance [is

 

taken into account] at every step of the analysis. * But is that a “troubling discrepancy,” as

 

Jakobson and Halle would have it? Can one not account for it as a fact serving as an example,

 

as do the phenomenologists who always need, keeping it always within sight, an exemplary

 

empirical content in the reading of an essence which is inde

pendent of it by right?

2. 

inadmissible in principle 

since one cannot consider “that in language form is opposed to

 

substance as a constant to a variable.” It is in the course of this second demonstration that the

 

literally Saussurian formulas reappear within the question of the relationships between speech

 

and writing; the order of writing is the order of exteriority, of the “occasional,” of the

 

“accessory,” of the “auxiliary,” of the 

“parasitic” 

(pp. 116-17; italics added) [pp. 16-17]. The

 

argument of Jakobson and Halle appeals to the factual genesis and invokes the secondariness

 

of writing in the colloquial sense: “Only after having mastered speech does one graduate to

 

reading and writ-ing.” Even if this commonsensical proposition were rigorously proved—

something that I do not believe (since each of its concepts harbors an immense problem)—

one would still have to receive assurance of its perti

nence to the argument. Even if “after”

 

were here a facile representation, if one knew perfectly well what one thought and stated

 

while assuring that one learns to write 

after 

having learned to speak, would that suffice to

 

conclude that what thus cornes “after” is parasitic? And what is a parasite? And what if

 

writing were precisely that which makes us reconsider our logic of the parasite?

In another moment of the critique, Jakobson and Halle recall the im-perfection of graphic

 

representation; that imperfection is due to “the cardinally dissimilar patterning of letters and

 

phonemes:”

Letters never, or only partially, reproduce the different distinctive features on which the

 

phonemic pattern is based and unfailingly disregard the structural relationship of these

 

features (p. 116) [p. 17].

I have suggested it above: does not the radical dissimilarity of the two elements—graphic and

 

phonic—exclude derivation? Does not the inade

quacy of graphic representation concern only

 

common alphabetic writing, to which glossematic formalism does not essentially refer?

 

Finally, if one

•

Jakobson and Halle, 

Fundamentals of Language,

cit., 

p. 16.55

xxx fotnote slutt xxx

((55))

accepts all the phonologist arguments thus presented, it must still be recognized that they

 

oppose a “scientific” concept of the spoken word to a vulgar concept of writing. What I would

 




wish to show is that one cannot exclude writing from the general experience of “the structural

 

relation-ship of these features.” Which amounts, of course, to reforming the con

cept of

 

writing.

In short, if the Jakobsonian analysis is faithful to Saussure in this matter, is it not especially so

 

to the Saussure of Chapter VI? Up to what point would Saussure have maintained the

 

inseparability of matter and form, which remains the most important argument of Jakobson

 

and Halle (p. 117), [p. 17]? The question may be repeated in the case of the position of André

 

Martinet who, in this debate, follows Chapter VI of the 

Course 

to the letter. 19 And only

 

Chapter VI, from which Martinet 

expressly 

dis

sociates the doctrine of what, in the 

Course,

 

effaces the privilege of phonic substance. After having explained why “a dead language with a

 

perfect ideography,” that is to say a communication effective through the system of a

 

generalized script, “could not have any real autonomy,” and why 

nevertheless, 

“such a system

 

would be something so particular that one can well understand why linguists 

want to exclude

 

it 

from the domain of their science” 

(La linguistique syncronique, 

p. 18; italics added),

 

Martinet criticizes those who, following a certain trend in Saussure, question the essentially

 

phonic character of the linguistic sign: “Much will be attempted to prove that Saussure is right

 

when he announces that ‘the thing that con

stitutes language 

[l’essentiel de la langue] is . . .

 

unrelated to the phonic character of the linguistic sign,’ and, going beyond the teaching of the

 

master, to declare that the linguistic sign does not necessarily have that phonic character” (p.

 

19).

On that precise point, it is not a question of “going beyond” the master’s teaching but of

 

following and extending it. Not to do it is to cling to what in Chapter VI greatly limits formal

 

and structural research and contradicts the least contestable findings of Saussurian doctrine.

 

To avoid “going beyond,” one risks returning to a point that falls short.

I believe that generalized writing is not just the idea of a system to be invented, an

 

hypothetical characteristic or a future possibility. I think on the contrary that oral language

 

already belongs to this writing. But that pre-supposes a modification of the concept of writing

 

that we for the moment merely anticipate. Even supposing that one is not given that modified

 

concept, supposing that one is considering a system of pure writing as an hypothesis for the

 

future or a working hypothesis, faced with that hypothe

sis, should a linguist refuse himself the

 

means of thinking it and of integrating its formulation within his theoretical discourse? Does

 

the fact that most linguists do so create a theoretical right? Martinet seems to be

((56))

of that opinion. After having elaborated a purely “dactylological” hypothe

sis of language, he

 

writes, in effect:

It must be recognized that the parallelism between this “dactylology” and phonology is

 

complete as much in synchronic as in diachronic material, and that the terminology associated

 

with the latter may be used for the former, ex

cept of course when the terms refer to the phonic

 

substance. Clearly, if we do not 

desire 

to exclude from the domain of linguistics the systems

 

of the type we have just imagined, it is most important to modify traditional terminology

 

relative to the articulation of signifiers so as to eliminate all reference to phonic substance; as

 

does Louis Hjelmslev when he uses “ceneme” and “cenematics” instead of “phoneme” and

 

“phonematics.” 

Yet it is understandable that the majority of linguists hesitate to modify

 

completely the traditional terminological edifice for the only theoretical advantages of being

 




able to include in the field of their science some purely hypothetical systems. To make them

 

agree to en-visage such a revolution, 

they must be persuaded that, in attested linguistic sys

-

tems, they have no advantage in considering the phonic substance of units of expression as to

 

be of direct interest (pp. 20—21; italics added).

Once again, we do not doubt the value of these phonological arguments, the presuppositions

 

behind which I have attempted to expose above. Once one assumes these presuppositions, it

 

would be absurd to reintroduce con

fusedly a derivative writing, in the area of oral language

 

and within the system of this derivation. Not only would ethnocentrism not be avoided, but all

 

the frontiers within the sphere of its legitimacy would then be con-fused. It is not a question

 

of rehabilitating writing in the narrow sense, nor of reversing the order of dependence when it

 

is evident. Phonologism does not brook any objections as long as one conserves the colloquial

 

concepts of speech and writing which form the solid fabric of its argumentation. Colloquial

 

and quotidian conceptions, inhabited besides—uncontradictorily enough—by an old history,

 

limited by frontiers that are hardly visible yet all the more rigorous by that very fact.

I would wish rather to suggest that the alleged derivativeness of writing, however real and

 

massive, was possible only on one condition: that the “original,” “natural,” etc. language had

 

never existed, never been intact and untouched by writing, that it had itself always been a

 

writing. An arche-writing whose necessity and new concept I wish to indicate and outline

 

here; and which I continue to call writing only because it essentially com

municates with the

 

vulgar concept of writing. The latter could not have imposed itself historically except by the

 

dissimulation of the arche-writing, by the desire for a speech displacing its other and its

 

double and working to reduce its difference. If I persist in calling that difference writing, it is

 

because, within the work of historical repression, writing was, by its situa

tion, destined to

 

signify the most formidable difference. It threatened the desire for the living speech from the

 

closest proximity, it 

breached

((57))

living speech from within and from the very beginning. And as we shall begin to see,

 

difference cannot be thought without the 

trace.

This arche-writing, although its concept is 

invoked 

by the themes of “the arbitrariness of the

 

sign” and of difference, cannot and can never be recog

nized as the 

object of a science. 

It is

 

that very thing which cannot let itself be reduced to the form of 

presence. 

The latter orders all

 

objectivity of the object and all relation of knowledge. That is why what I would be tempted

 

to consider in the development of the 

Course 

as “progress,” calling into question in return the

 

uncritical positions of Chapter VI, never gives rise to a new “scientific” concept of writing.

Can one say as much of the algebraism of Hjelmslev, which undoubtedly drew the most

 

rigorous conclusions from that progress?

The 

Principes de grammaire générale 

(1928) separated out within the doctrine of the 

Course

 

the phonological principle and the principle of dif

ference: It isolated a concept of 

form 

which

 

permitted a distinction be

tween formal difference and phonic difference, and this even within

 

“spoken” language (p. 117). Grammar is independent of semantics and phonology (p. 118) .

That independence is the very principle of glossematics as the formal science of language. Its

 

formality supposes that “there is no necessary con

nexion between sounds and language.” 20

 




That formality is itself the condi

tion of a purely functional analysis. The idea of a linguistic

 

function and of a purely linguistic unit—the glosseme—excludes then not only the con

-

sideration of the substance of expression (material substance) but also that of the substance of

 

the content (immaterial substance). “Since lan

guage is a form and not a substance (Saussure),

 

the glossemes are by defi

nition independent of substance, immaterial (semantic,

 

psychological and logical) and material (phonic, graphic, etc.) .” 21 The study of the function-

ing of language, of its 

play, 

presupposes that the substance of 

meaning 

and, among other

 

possible substances, that of 

sound, 

be placed in parenthesis. The unity of sound and of sense is

 

indeed here, as I proposed above, the reassuring closing of play. Hjelmslev situates his

 

concept of the 

scheme 

or 

play 

of language within Saussure’s heritage—of Saussure’s

 

formalism and his theory of value. Although he prefers to compare linguistic value to the

 

“value of exchange in the economic sciences” rather than to the “purely logico-mathematical

 

value,” he assigns a limit to this analogy.

An economic value is by definition a value with two faces: not only does it play the role of a

 

constant vis-à-vis the concrete units of money, but it also itself plays the role of a variable vis-

à-vis a fixed quantity of merchandise which serves it as a standard. In linguistics on the other

 

hand there is nothing that corresponds to a standard. That is why the game of chess and not

 

economic fact remains for Saussure the most faithful image of a grammar. The scheme of

 

language is in the last analysis 

a game 

and nothing more 22

((58))

In the 

Prolegomena to a Theory of Language 

(1943), setting forth the opposition

 

expression/content, 

which he substitutes for the difference 

signifier/signified, 

and in which

 

each term may be considered from the point of view of 

form 

or 

substance, 

Hjelmslev

 

criticizes the idea of a language 

naturally 

bound to the substance of phonic expression. It 

is

 

by mistake that it has hitherto been supposed “that the substance-expression of a spoken

 

language should consist of ‘sounds’:”

Thus, as has been pointed out by the Zwimers in particular, the fact has been overlooked that

 

speech is accompanied by, and that certain components of speech can be replaced by, gesture,

 

and that in reality, as the Zwimers say, not only the so-called organs of speech (throat, mouth,

 

and nose), but very nearly all the striate musculature cooperate in the exercise of “natural”

 

language. Fur

ther, it is possible to replace the usual sound-and-gesture substance with any

 

other that offers itself as appropriate under changed external circumstances. Thus the same

 

linguistic form may also be manifested in writing, as happens with a phonetic or phonemic

 

notation and with the so-called phonetic orthographies, as for example the Finnish. Here is a

 

“graphic” substance which is addressed exclusively to the eye and which need not be

 

transposed into a phonetic “substance” in order to be grasped or understood. And this graphic

 

“substance” can, precisely from the point of view of the substance, be of quite various sorts

 

23

Refusing to presuppose a “derivation” of substances following from the substance of phonic

 

expression, Hjelmslev places this problem outside the area of structural analysis and of

 

linguistics.

Moreover it is not always certain what is derived and what not; we must not forget that the

 

discovery of alphabetic writing is hidden in prehistory [n.: Bertrand Russell quite rightly calls

 

attention to the fact that we have no means of deciding whether writing or speech is the older

 




form of human expression 

(An Outline of Philosophy 

[London, 1927], p. 47)], so that the

 

assertion that it rests on a phonetic analysis is only one of the possible diachronic hypotheses;

 

it may also be rested on a formal analysis of linguistic structure. But in any case, as is

 

recognized by modern linguistics, diachronic considerations are irrelevant for synchronic

 

descriptions (pp. 104-05).

H. J. Uldall provides a remarkable formulation of the fact that glosse

matic criticism operates

 

at the same time thanks to Saussure and against him; that, as I suggested above, the proper

 

space of a grammatology is at the same time opened and closed by 

The Course in General

 

Linguistics. 

To show that Saussure did not develop “all the theoretical consequences of his

 

discovery,” he writes:

It is even more curious when we consider that the practical consequences have been widely

 

drawn, indeed had been drawn thousands of years before Saussure, for it is only through the

 

concept of a difference between form and substance

((59))

that we can explain the possibility of speech and writing existing at the same time as

 

expressions of one and the same language. If either of these two sub-stances, the stream of air

 

or the stream of ink, were an integral part of the language itself, it would not be possible to go

 

from one to the other without changing the language. 

24

Undoubtedly the Copenhagen School thus frees a field of research: it becomes possible to

 

direct attention not only to the purity of a form freed from all “natural” bonds to a substance

 

but also to everything that, in the stratification of language, depends on the substance of

 

graphic expression. An original and rigorously delimited description of this may thus be

 

promised. Hjelmslev recognizes that an “analysis of writing without regard to sound has not

 

yet been undertaken” (p. 105). While regretting also that “the substance of ink has not

 

received the same attention on the part of linguists that they have so lavishly bestowed on the

 

substance of air,” H. J. Uldall delimits these problems and emphasizes the mutual independ

-

ence of the substances of expression. He illustrates it particularly by the fact that, in

 

orthography, no grapheme corresponds to accents of pro

nunciation (for Rousseau this was the

 

misery and the menace of writing) and that, reciprocally, in pronunciation, no phoneme

 

corresponds to the spacing between written words (pp. 13-14).

Recognizing the specificity of 

writing, 

glossematics did not merely give itself the means of

 

describing the 

graphic 

element. It showed how to reach the 

literary 

element, to what in

 

literature passes through an irreducibly graphic text, tying the 

play of form 

to a determined

 

substance of expression. If there is something in literature which does not allow itself to be

 

reduced to the voice, to epos or to poetry, one cannot recapture it except by rigor

ously

 

isolating the bond that links 

the play of form 

to the substance of graphic expression. (It will by

 

the same token be seen that “pure litera-ture,” thus respected in its irreducibilty, also risks

 

limiting the play, restrict-ing it. The desire to restrict play is, moreover, irresistible.) This

 

interest in literature is effectively manifested in the Copenhagen School. 25 It thus removes

 

the Rousseauist and Saussurian caution with regard to literary arts. It radicalizes the efforts of

 

the Russian formalists, specifically of the O.PO.IAZ, who, in their attention to the being-

literary of literature, perhaps favored the phonological instance and the literary models that it

 

dominates. Notably poetry. That which, within the history of literature and in the structure of a

 

literary text in general, escapes that framework, merits a type of description whose norms and

 




conditions of possibility glossematics has perhaps better isolated. It has perhaps thus better

 

pre-pared itself to study the purely graphic stratum within the structure of the literary text

 

within the history of the becoming-literary of literality, notably in its “modernity.”

Undoubtedly a new domain is thus opened to new and fecund re-searches. But I am not

 

primarily interested in such a parallelism or such a

((60))

recaptured parity of substances of expression. It is clear that if the phonic substance lost its

 

privilege, it was not to the advantage of the graphic sub-stance, which lends itself to the same

 

substitutions. To the extent that it liberates and is irrefutable, glossematics still operates with a

 

popular con

cept of writing. However original and irreducible it might be, the “form of

 

expression” linked by correlation to the 

graphic 

“substance of expression” remains very

 

determined. It is very dependent and very derivative with regard to the arche-writing of which

 

I speak. This arche-writing would be at work not only in the form and substance of graphic

 

expression but also in those of nongraphic expression. It would constitute not only the pattern

 

uniting form to all substance, graphic or otherwise, but the movement of the 

sign-function

 

linking a content to an expression, whether it be graphic or not. This theme could not have a

 

place in Hjelmslev’s system.

It is because arche-writing, movement of differance, irreducible arche-synthesis, opening in

 

one and the same possibility, temporalization as well as relationship with the other and

 

language, cannot, as the condition of all linguistic systems, form a part of the linguistic

 

system itself and be situated as an object in its field. (Which does not mean it has a real field

 

elsewhere, another 

assignable 

site.) 

Its concept could in no way enrich the scientific, positive,

 

and “immanent” (in the Hjelmslevian sense) description of the system itself. Therefore, the

 

founder of glossematics would no doubt have questioned its necessity, as he rejects, en bloc

 

and legitimately, all the extra-linguistic theories which do not arise from the irreducible

 

immanence of the linguistic system. 26 He would have seen in that notion one of those

 

appeals to experience which a theory should dispense with 27 He would not have understood

 

why the name writing continued to be used for that X which becomes so different from what

 

has always been called “writing.”

I have already begun to justify this word, and especially the necessity of the communication

 

between the concept of arche-writing and the vulgar concept of writing submitted to

 

deconstruction by it. I shall continue to do so below. As for the concept of experience, it is

 

most unwieldy here. Like all the notions I am using here, it belongs to the history of

 

metaphysics and we can only use it under erasure [sous 

rature]. 

“Experience” has always

 

desig

nated the relationship with a presence, whether that relationship had the form of

 

consciousness or not. At any rate, we must, according to this sort of contortion and contention

 

which the discourse is obliged to undergo, ex-haust the resources of the concept of experience

 

before attaining and in order to attain, by deconstruction, its ultimate foundation. It is the only

 

way to escape “empiricism” and the “naive” critiques of experience at the same time. Thus,

 

for example, the experience whose “theory,” Hjelmslev says, “must be independent” is not the

 

whole of experience. It always cor-responds to a certain type of factual or regional experience

 

(historical, psy-

((61))




chological, physiological, sociological, etc.), giving rise to a science that is itself regional and,

 

as such, rigorously outside linguistics. That is not so at all in the case of experience as arche-

writing. The parenthesizing of regions of experience or of the totality of natural experience

 

must discover a field of transcendental experience. This experience is only accessible in so far

 

as, after having, like Hjelmslev, isolated the specificity of the linguistic system and excluded

 

all the extrinsic sciences and metaphysical speculations, one asks the question of the

 

transcendental origin of the system itself, as a system of the objects of a science, and,

 

correlatively, of the theoretical system which studies it: here of the objective and “deduc

tive”

 

system which glossematics wishes to be. Without that, the decisive progress accomplished by

 

a formalism respectful of the originality of its object, of “the immanent system of its objects,”

 

is plagued by a scientificist objectivism, that is to say by another unperceived or unconfessed

 

meta-physics. This is often noticeable in the work of the Copenhagen School. It is to escape

 

falling back into this naive objectivism that I refer here to a transcendentality that I elsewhere

 

put into question. It is because I be

lieve that there is a short-of and a beyond of transcendental

 

criticism. To see to it that the beyond does not return to the within is to recognize in the

 

contortion the necessity of a pathway 

[parcours]. 

That pathway must leave a track in the text.

 

Without that track, abandoned to the simple content of its conclusions, the ultra-

transcendental text will so closely resemble the precritical text as to be indistinguishable from

 

it. We must now form and meditate upon the law of this resemblance. What I call the erasure

 

of con

cepts ought to mark the places of that future meditation. For example, the value of the

 

transcendental arche 

[archie] 

must make its necessity felt before letting itself be erased. The

 

concept of arche-trace must comply with both that necessity and that erasure. It is in fact

 

contradictory and not acceptable within the logic of identity. The trace is not only the

 

disappear

ance of origin—within the discourse that we sustain and according to the path that

 

we follow it means that the origin did not even disappear, that it was never constituted except

 

reciprocally by a nonorigin, the trace, which thus becomes the origin of the origin. From then

 

on, to wrench the concept of the trace from the classical scheme, which would derive it from a

 

presence or from an originary nontrace and which would make of it an empirical mark, one

 

must indeed speak of an originary trace or arche-trace. Yet we know that that concept destroys

 

its name and that, if all begins with the trace, there is above all no originary trace. 28 We must

 

then 

situate, 

as a simple 

moment of the discourse, 

the phenomenological reduction and the

 

Husserlian reference to a transcendental experience. To the extent that the concept of

 

experience in general—and of transcendental experience, in Husserl in particular—remains

 

governed by the theme of presence, it par-

((62))

ticipates in the movement of the reduction of the trace. The Living Present 

(lebendige

 

Gegenwart) is 

the universal and absolute form of transcendental experience to which Husserl

 

refers us. In the descriptions of the move

ments of temporalization, all that does not torment

 

the simplicity and the domination of that form seems to indicate to us how much

 

transcendental phenomenology belongs to metaphysics. But that must come to terms with the

 

forces of rupture. In the originary temporalization and the movement of relationship with the

 

outside, as Husserl actually describes them, non-presentation or depresentation is as

 

“originary” as presentation. 

That is why a thought of the trace can no more break with a

 

transcendental phenomenology than be reduced to it. 

Here as elsewhere, to pose the prob-lem

 

in terms of choice, to oblige or to believe oneself obliged to answer it by 

a yes 

or 

no, 

to

 

conceive of appurtenance as an allegiance or nonappur

tenance as plain speaking, is to confuse

 

very different levels, paths, and styles. In the deconstruction of the arche, one does not make a

 

choice.




Therefore I admit the necessity of going through the concept of the arche-trace. How does that

 

necessity direct us from the interior of the linguistic system? How does the path that leads

 

from Saussure to Hjelmslev forbid us to avoid the originary trace?

In that its passage through 

form is 

a passage through the 

imprint. 

And the meaning of

 

differance in general would be more accsessible to us if the unity of that double passage

 

appeared more clearly.

In both cases, one must begin from the possibility of neutralizing the phonic substance.

On the one hand, the phonic element, the term, the plenitude that is called sensible, would not

 

appear as such without the difference or opposition which gives them 

form. 

Such is the most

 

evident significance of the appeal to difference as the reduction of phonic substance. Here the

 

appearing and functioning of difference presupposes an originary synthesis not preceded by

 

any absolute simplicity. Such would be the originary trace. Without a retention in the minimal

 

unit of temporal experience, without a trace retaining the other as other in the same, no

 

difference would do its work and no meaning would appear. It is not the question of a

 

constituted difference here, but rather, before all determination of the content, of the 

pure

 

movement which produces difference. 

The (pure) trace is differance. 

It does not depend on

 

any sensible plentitude, audible or visible, phonic or graphic. It is, on the contrary, the

 

condition of such a plenitude. Although it 

does not exist, 

although it is never a 

being-present

 

outside of all plenitude, its possibility is by rights anterior to all that one calls sign

 

(signified/sig

nifier, content/expression, etc.), concept or opeartion, motor or sensory. This

 

differance is therefore not more sensible than intelligible and it permits the articulation of

 

signs among themselves within the same ab-

((63))

stract order—a phonic or graphic text for example—or between two orders of expression. It

 

permits the articulation of speech and writing—in the colloquial sense—as it founds the

 

metaphysical opposition between the sensible and the intelligible, then between signifier and

 

signified, expres

sion and content, etc. If language were not already, in that sense, a writing, no

 

derived “notation” would be possible; and the classical problem of rela

tionships between

 

speech and writing could not arise. Of course, the posi

tive 

sciences 

of signification can only

 

describe the 

work 

and the 

fact 

of dif

ferance, the determined differences and the determined

 

presences that they make possible. There cannot be a science of differance itself in its opera

-

tion, as it is impossible to have a science of the origin of presence itself, that is to say of a

 

certain nonorigin.

Differance is therefore the formation of form. But it is 

on the other hand 

the being-imprinted

 

of the imprint. It is well-known that Saussure distinguishes between the “sound-image” and

 

the objective sound (p. 98) [p. 66]. He thus gives himself the right to “reduce,” in the

 

phenomenologi

cal sense, the sciences of accoustics and physiology at the moment that he

 

institutes the science of language. The sound-image is the structure of the appearing of the

 

sound 

[l’apparaître du son] 

which is anything but the sound appearing 

[le son apparaissant].

 

It is the sound-image that he calls 

signifier, 

reserving the name 

signified 

not for the thing, to

 

be sure (it is reduced by the act and the very ideality of language), but for the “con

cept,”

 

undoubtedly an unhappy notion here; let us say for the ideality of the sense. “I propose to

 

retain the word 

sign [signe] 

to designate the whole and to replace 

concept 

and 

sound-image

 

respectively by 

signified [sign fie] 

and 

signifier [sign fiant].” 

The sound-image is what is

 




heard; 

not the 

sound 

heard but the being-heard of the sound. Being-heard is structurally phe

-

nomenal and belongs to an order radically dissimilar to that of the real sound in the world.

 

One can only divide this subtle but absolutely de

cisive heterogeneity by a phenomenological

 

reduction. The latter is there-fore indispensable to all analyses of being-heard, whether they

 

be inspired by linguistic, psychoanalytic, or other preoccupations.

Now the “sound-image,” the structured appearing 

[l’apparaître] 

of the sound, the “sensory

 

matter” 

lived 

and 

informed 

by differance, what Hus

serl would name the 

hylè/morphé

 

structure, distinct from all mundane reality, is called the “psychic image” by Saussure: “The

 

latter [the sound-image] is not the material sound, a purely physical thing, but the psychic

 

imprint of the sound, the impression that it makes on our senses 

[la représentation que nous

 

en donne le témoignage de nos sens]. 

The sound-image is sensory, and if I happen to call it

 

‘material,’ it is only in that sense, and by way of opposing it, to the other term of the associa

-

tion, the concept, which is generally more abstract” (p. 98) [p. 66]. Al-

((64))

though the word “psychic” is not perhaps convenient, except for exercising in this matter a

 

phenomenological caution, the originality of a certain place is well marked.

Before specifying it, let us note that this is not necessarily what Jakobson and other linguists

 

could criticize as “the mentalist point of view”:

In the oldest of these approaches, going back to Baudouin de Courtenay and still surviving,

 

the phoneme is a sound imagined or intended, opposed to the emitted sound as a

 

“psychophonetic” phenomenon to the “physiophonetic” fact. It is the psychic equivalent of an

 

exteriorized sound. 

29

Although the notion of the “psychic image” thus defined (that is to say according to a

 

prephenomenological psychology of the imagination) is indeed of this mentalist inspiration, it

 

could be defended against Jakob-son’s criticism by specifying: (I) that it could be conserved

 

without neces

sarily affirming that “our internal speech . . . is confined to the dis

tinctive

 

features to the exclusion of the configurative, or redundant fea

tures;” (2) that the qualification

 

psychic 

is not retained if it designates exclusively 

another natural reality, internal and not

 

external. 

Here the Husserlian correction is indispensable and transforms even the premises of

 

the debate. Real 

(reell 

and not 

real) 

component of lived experience, the 

hyle/morphé 

structure

 

is not a reality 

(Realität). 

As to the intentional object, for example, the content of the image, it

 

does not really 

(reall) 

belong either to the world or to lived experience: the nonreal com

-

ponent of lived experience. The psychic image of which Saussure speaks must not be an

 

internal reality copying an external one. Husserl, who criticizes this concept of “portrait” in

 

Ideen 

I * shows also in the Krisis (pp. 63 f.) ** how phenomenology should overcome the

 

naturalist opposition—whereby psychology and the other sciences of man survive—between

 

“internal” and “external” experience. It is therefore indispensable to pre-serve the distinction

 

between the appearing sound 

[le son apparaissant] 

and the appearing of the sound

 

[l’apparaître du son] 

in order to escape the worst and the most prevalent of confusions; and it

 

is in principle pos

sible to do it without “attempt[ing] to overcome the antinomy between

 

invariance and variability by assigning the former to the internal and the latter to the external

 

experience” (Jakobson, op. cit., p. 112) [p. 12]. The difference between invariance and

 

variability does not separate the two domains from each other, it divides each of them within

 

itself. That gives enough indication that the essence of the 

phonè 

cannot be read di-

These precautions taken, it should be recognized that it is in the spe

cific zone of this imprint

 

and this trace, in the temporalization of a

which is neither 

in

“another world,” which is not more sonorous than luminous, not more

that differences appear among the elements or rather produce them, make them emerge as

 

such and constitute the 

texts, 

the chains, and the systems of traces. These chains and systems

 

cannot be outlined except in the fabric of this. trace or imprint. The unheard difference

 

between the appearing and the appearance 

[l’apparaissant et l’apparaître] 

(between the

 

“world” and “lived experience”) is the condition of all other differences, of all other traces,

 

and 

it is already a trace. 

This last concept is thus absolutely and by rights “anterior” to all

 

physiological 

problematics concerning the nature of the 

engramme 

[the unit of engraving], or

 

metaphysical 

problematics concerning the meaning of absolute presence whose trace is thus

 

opened to deciphering. 

The trace is in fact the absolute origin of sense in general. Which

 

amounts to saying once again that there is no absolute origin of sense in general. The trace is

 

the differance 

which opens appearance 

[l

’

apparaître] 

and signification. Articulating the living

 

upon the nonliving in general, origin of all repetition, origin of ideality, the trace is not more

 

ideal than real, not more intelligible than sensible, not more a transparent signification than an

 

opaque energy and 

no concept of metaphysics can describe it. 

And as it is 

a fortiori 

anterior to

 

the distinction between regions of sensibility, anterior to sound as much as to light, is there a

 

sense in establishing a “natural” hierarchy between the sound-imprint, for example, and the

 

visual (graphic) imprint? The graphic image is not seen; and the acoustic image is not heard.

 

The difference between the full unities of the voice remains unheard. And, the difference in

 

the body of the inscription is also invisible.

The Hinge [La Brisure]

You have, I suppose, dreamt 

of 

finding a single word for designating dif

ference and

 

articulation. I have perhaps located it by chance in Robert[’s Dictionary] if I play on the

 

word, or rather indicate its double meaning. This word is 

brisure 

[joint, break] “—broken,

 

cracked part. Cf. breach, crack, fracture, fault, split, fragment, 

[brèche, cassure, fracture,

 

faille, fente, 

fragment.]—Hinged articulation of two parts of wood- or metal-work. The hinge,

 

the 

brisure 

[folding-joint] of a shutter. Cf. 

joint.”—Roger 

Laporte 

(letter)

Origin of the experience of space and time, this writing of difference, this fabric of the trace,

 

permits the difference between space and time to be

((66))




articulated, to appear as such, in the unity of an experience (of a “same” lived out of a “same”

 

body proper 

[corps propre]) . 

This articulation there-fore permits a graphic (“visual” or

 

“tactile,” “spatial”) chain to be adapted, on occasion in a linear fashion, to a spoken

 

(“phonic,” “temporal”) chain. It is from the primary possibility of this articulation that one

 

must begin. Difference is articulation.

This is, indeed, what Saussure says, contradicting Chapter VI:

The question of the vocal apparatus obviously takes a secondary place in the problem of

 

language. One definition of 

articulated 

language might confirm that conclusion. In Latin,

 

articulus 

means a member, part, or subdivision of a sequence; applied to speech 

[langage],

 

articulation designates either the sub-division of a spoken chain into syllables or the

 

subdivision of the chain of meanings into significant units. . . . Using the second definition,

 

we can say that 

what is natural to mankind is not spoken language 

but the faculty of con

-

structing a language; i.e., a system of distinct signs corresponding to distinct ideas (p. 26;

 

italics added) [p. ro].

The idea of the “psychic imprint” therefore relates essentially to the idea of articulation.

 

Without the difference between the sensory appearing 

[apparaissant] 

and its lived appearing

 

[apparaître] 

(“mental imprint”), the temporalizing synthesis, which permits differences to

 

appear in a chain of significations, could not operate. That the “imprint” is irreducible means

 

also that speech is originarily passive, but in a sense of passivity that all intramundane

 

metaphors would only betray. This passivity is also the rela

tionship to a past, to an always-

already-there that no reactivation of the origin could fully master and awaken to presence.

 

This impossibility of re-animating absolutely the manifest evidence of an originary presence

 

refers us therefore to an absolute past. That is what authorized us to call 

trace 

that which does

 

not let itself be summed up in the simplicity of a present. It could in fact have been objected

 

that, in the indecomposable synthesis of temporalization, protection is as indispensable as

 

retention. And their two dimensions are not added up but the one implies the other in a strange

 

fashion. To be sure, what is anticipated in protention does not sever the present any less from

 

its self-identity than does that which is retained in the trace. But if anticipation were

 

privileged, the irreducibility of the always-already-there and the fundamental passivity that is

 

called time would risk effacement. On the other hand, if the trace refers to an absolute past, it

 

is because it obliges us to think a past that can no longer be understood in the form of a

 

modified presence, as a present-past. Since past has always signified present-past, the absolute

 

past that is retained in the trace no longer rigorously merits the name “past.” Another name to

 

erase, especially since the strange movement of the trace proclaims as much as it recalls:

 

differance defers-differs 

[di f f ère] . 

With the same precaution and under the same erasure, it

 

may be said that its passivity is also its relationship with

((67))

the “future.” The concepts of 

present, past, 

and 

future, 

everything in the concepts of time and

 

history which implies evidence of them—the meta-physical concept of time in general—

cannot adequately describe the struc

ture of the trace. And deconstructing the simplicity of

 

presence does not amount only to accounting for the horizons of potential presence, indeed of

 

a “dialectic” of protention and retention that one would install in the heart of the present

 

instead of surrounding it with it. It is not a matter of complicating the structure of time while

 

conserving its homogeneity and its fundamental successivity, by demonstrating for example

 

that the past present and the future present constitute originarily, by dividing it, the form of

 




the living present. Such a complication, which is in effect the same that Husserl described,

 

abides, in spite of an audacious phenomenological reduc

tion, by the evidence and presence of

 

a linear, objective, and mundane model. 

Now 

B would be as such constituted by the retention

 

of Now A and the protention of 

Now 

C; in spite of all the play that would follow from it, from

 

the fact that each one of the three 

Now-s 

reproduces that structure in itself, this model of

 

successivity would prohibit a 

Now X 

from taking the place of 

Now 

A, for example, and would

 

prohibit that, by a delay that is inadmissible to consciousness, an experience be determined, in

 

its very present, by a present which would not have preceded it immediately but would be

 

considerably “anterior” to it. It is the problem of the deferred effect 

(Nachträglichkeit) 

of

 

which Freud speaks. The temporality to which he refers cannot be that which lends itself to a

 

phenomenology of con

sciousness or of presence and one may indeed wonder by what right all

 

that is in question here should still be called time, now, anterior present, delay, etc.

In its greatest formality, this immense problem would be formulated thus: is the temporality

 

described by a transcendental phenomenology as “dialectical” as possible, a ground which the

 

structures, let us say the unconscious structures, of temporality would simply modify? Or is

 

the phenomenological model itself constituted, as a warp of language, logic, evidence,

 

fundamental security, upon a woof that is not its own? And which—such is the most difficult

 

problem—is no longer at all mundane? For it is not by chance that the transcendental

 

phenomenology of the internal 

time-consciousness, 

so careful to place cosmic time within

 

brackets, must, as consciousness and even as internal consciousness, live a time that is an

 

accomplice of the time of the world. Between consciousness, percep

tion (internal or external),

 

and the “world,” the rupture, even in the subtle form of the reduction, is perhaps not possible.

It is in a certain “unheard” sense, then, that speech is in the world, rooted in that passivity

 

which metaphysics calls sensibility in general. Since there is no nonmetaphoric language to

 

oppose to metaphors here, one must, as Bergson wished, multiply antagonistic metaphors.

 

“Wish sensibilized,” is how Maine de Biran, with a slightly different intention,

((68))

named the vocalic word. That the logos is first imprinted and that that imprint is the writing-

resource of language, signifies, to be sure, that the logos is not a creative activity, the

 

continuous full element of the divine word, etc. But it would not mean a single step outside of

 

metaphysics if nothing more than a new motif of “return to finitude,” of “God’s death,” etc.,

 

were the result of this move. It is that conceptuality and that problem

atics that must be

 

deconstructed. They belong to the onto-theology they fight against. Differance is also

 

something other than finitude.

According to Saussure, the passivity of speech is first its relationship with language. The

 

relationship between passivity and difference cannot be distinguished from the relationship

 

between the fundamental 

unconscious

ness 

of language (as rootedness within the language)

 

and the 

spacing 

(pause, blank, punctuation, interval in general, etc.) which constitutes the

 

origin of signification. It is because “language is a form and not a sub-stance” (p. 169) [p.

 

122] that, paradoxically, the activity of speech can and must always draw from it. But if it is a

 

form, it is because “in language there are only differences” (p. 166) [p. 120]. 

Spacing 

(notice

 

that this word speaks the articulation of space and time, the becoming-space of time and the

 

becoming-time of space) is always the unperceived, the nonpresent, and the nonconscious. As

 

such, 

if one can still use that expression in a non-phenomenological way; for here we pass the

 

very limits of phenomenology. Arche-writing as spacing cannot occur 

as such 

within the

 




phenomenological experience of a 

presence. 

It marks 

the dead time 

within the presence of the

 

living present, within the general form of all presence. The dead time is at work. That is why,

 

once again, in spite of all the discursive re-sources that the former may borrow from the latter,

 

the concept of the trace will never be merged with a phenomenology of writing. As the

 

phenomenology of the sign in general, a phenomenology of writing is im-possible. No

 

intuition can be realized in the place where “the ‘whites’ in-deed take on an importance”

 

(Preface to 

Coup de dés). *

Perhaps it is now easier to understand why Freud says of the dreamwork that it is comparable

 

rather to a writing than to a language, and to a hieroglyphic rather than to a phonetic writing.

 

30 And to understand why Saussure says of language that it “is not a function of the speaker”

 

(p. 

30) 

[p. 141. With or without the complicity of their authors, all these proposi

tions must be

 

understood as more than the simple 

reversals 

of a meta-physics of presence or of conscious

 

subjectivity. Constituting and dislocat

ing it at the same time, writing is other than the subject,

 

in whatever sense the latter is understood. Writing can never be thought under the category of

 

the subject; however it is modified, however it is endowed with consciousness or

 

unconsciousness, it will refer, by the entire thread of its

((69))

history, to the substantiality of a presence unperturbed by accident4, or to the identity of the

 

selfsame 

[le propre] 

in the presence of self-relationship. And the thread of that history clearly

 

does not run within the borders of metaphysics. To determine an X as a subject is never an

 

operation of a pure convention, it is never an indifferent gesture in relation to writing.

Spacing as writing is the becoming-absent and the becoming-unconscious of the subject. By

 

the movement of its drift/derivation 

[dérive] 

the emancipation of the sign constitutes in return

 

the desire of presence. That becoming—or that drift/derivation—does not befall the subject

 

which would choose it or would passively let itself be drawn along by it. As the subject’s

 

relationship with its own death, this becoming is the constitution of subjectivity. On all levels

 

of life’s organization, that is to say, of 

the economy of death. 

All graphemes are of a

 

testamentary essence. 31 And the original absence of the subject of writing is also the absence

 

of the thing or the referent.

Within the horizontality of spacing, which is in fact the precise dimen

sion I have been

 

speaking of so far, and which is not opposed to it as surface opposes depth, it is not even

 

necessary to say that spacing cuts, drops, and causes to drop within the unconscious: the

 

unconscious is noth

ing without this cadence and before this caesura. This signification is

 

formed only within the hollow of differance: of discontinuity and of dis

creteness, of the

 

diversion and the reserve of what does not appear. This hinge 

[brisure] 

of language as

 

writing, this discontinuity, could have, at a given moment within linguistics, run up against a

 

rather precious 

con

tinuist 

prejudice. Renouncing it, phonology must indeed renounce all dis

-

tinctions between writing and the spoken word, and thus renounce not itself, phonology, but

 

rather phonologism. What Jakobson recognizes in this respect is most important for us:




The stream of oral speech, physically continuous, originally confronted the mathematical

 

theory of communication with a situation “considerably more involved” ([C.E.] Shannon and

 

[W.] ‘Weaver 

[The Mathematical Theory of Communication 

(Urbana, 1949), pp. 74 f., 11z f.])

 

than in the case of a finite set of discrete constituents, as presented by written speech.

 

Linguistic analysis, however, came to resolve oral speech into a finite series of elementary

 

informa

tional units. These ultimate discrete units, the so-called “distinctive features,” are

 

aligned into simultaneous bundles termed “phonemes,” which in turn are concatenated into

 

sequences. Thus form in language has a manifestly granular structure and is subject to a

 

quantal description 32

The hinge 

[brisure] 

marks the impossibility that a sign, the unity of a signifier and a signified,

 

be produced within the plenitude of a present and an absolute presence. That is why there is

 

no full speech, however much one might wish to restore it by means or without benefit of

 

psychoanalysis. Before thinking to reduce it or to restore the meaning of the full speech

((70))

which claims to be truth, one must ask the question of meaning and of its origin in difference.

 

Such is the place of a problematic of the 

trace.

Why of the 

trace? 

What led us to the choice of this word? I have begun to answer this

 

question. But this question is such, and such the nature of my answer, that the place of the one

 

and of the other must constantly be in movement. If words and concepts receive meaning only

 

in sequences of differences, one can justify one’s language, and one’s choice of terms, only

 

within a topic [an orientation in space] and an historical strategy. The justification can

 

therefore never be absolute and definitive. It corresponds to a condition of forces and

 

translates an historical calculation. Thus, over and above those that I have already defined, a

 

certain number of givens belonging to the discourse of our time have progressively imposed

 

this choice upon me. The word 

trace 

must refer to itself to a certain number of contemporary

 

discourses whose force I intend to take into account. Not that I accept them totally. But the

 

word 

trace 

establishes the clearest con

nections with them and thus permits me to dispense

 

with certain develop

ments which have already demonstrated their effectiveness in those

 

fields. Thus, I relate this concept of 

trace 

to what is at the center of the latest work of

 

Emmanuel Levinas and his critique of ontology: 33 relationship to the illeity as to the alterity

 

of a past that never was and can never be lived in the originary or modified form of presence.

 

Reconciled here to a Heideg

gerian intention,—as it is not in Levinas’s thought—this notion

 

signifies, sometimes beyond Heideggerian discourse, the undermining of an ontology which,

 

in its innermost course, has determined the meaning of being as presence and the meaning of

 

language as the full continuity of speech. To make enigmatic what one thinks one understands

 

by the words “proximity,” “immediacy,” “presence” (the proximate 

[proche], 

the own 

[pro

 

pre], 

and the pre- of presence), is my final intention in this book. This deconstruc

tion of

 

presence accomplishes itself through the deconstruction of con

sciousness, and therefore

 

through the irreducible notion of the trace 

(Spur), 

as it appears in both Nietzschean and

 

Freudian discourse. And finally, in all scientific fields, notably in biology, this notion seems

 

currently to be dominant and irreducible.

If the trace, arche-phenomenon of “memory,” which must be thought before the opposition of

 

nature and culture, animality and humanity, etc., belongs to the very movement of

 

signification, then signification is a priori written, whether inscribed or not, in one form or

 

another, in a “sensible” and “spatial” element that is called “exterior.” Arche-writing, at first

 




the possibility of the spoken word, then of the 

“graphie” 

in the narrow sense, the birthplace

 

of “usurpation,” denounced from Plato to Saussure, this trace is the opening of the first

 

exteriority in general, the enigmatic rela

tionship of the living to its other and of an inside to an

 

outside: spacing. The outside, “spatial” and “objective” exteriority which we believe we

((71))

know as the most familiar thing in the world, as familiarity itself, would not appear without

 

the grammè, without differance as temporalization, without the nonpresense of the other

 

inscribed within the sense of the present, without the relationship with death as the concrete

 

structure of the living present. Metaphor would be forbidden. The presence-absence of the

 

trace, which one should not even call its ambiguity but rather its play (for the word

 

“ambiguity” requires the logic of presence, even when it begins to disobey that logic), carries

 

in itself the problems of the letter and the spirit, of body and soul, and of all the problems

 

whose primary affinity I have recalled. All dualisms, all theories of the immortality of the soul

 

or of the spirit, as well as all monisms, spiritualist or materialist, dialectical or vulgar, are the

 

unique theme of a metaphysics whose entire history was compelled to strive toward the

 

reduction of the trace. The subordination of the trace to the full presence summed up in the

 

logos, the humbling of writing beneath a speech dreaming its plenitude, such are the gestures

 

required by an onto-theology determining the archeological and eschatological mean-ing of

 

being as presence, as parousia, as life without differance: another name for death, historical

 

metonymy where God’s name holds death in check. That is why, if this movement begins its

 

era in the form of Platon-ism, it ends in infinitist metaphysics. Only infinite being can reduce

 

the difference in presence. In that sense, the name of God, at least as it is pronounced within

 

classical rationalism, is the name of indifference itself. Only a positive infinity can lift the

 

trace, “sublimate” it (it has recently been proposed that the Hegelian 

Au f hebung 

be translated

 

as sublimation; this translation may be of dubious worth as translation, but the juxta

position is

 

of interest here) . We must not therefore speak of a “theological prejudice,” functioning

 

sporadically when it is a question of the plenitude of the logos; the logos as the sublimation of

 

the trace is 

theological. 

In

finitist theologies are always logocentrisms, whether they are

 

creationisms or not. Spinoza himself said of the understanding—or logos—that it was the

 

immediate 

infinite mode of the divine substance, even calling it its eternal son in the 

Short

 

Treatise.* 

It is also to this epoch, “reaching completion” with Hegel, with a theology of the

 

absolute concept as logos, that all the noncritical concepts accredited by linguistics belong, at

 

least to the extent that linguistics must confirm—and how can 

a science 

avoid it?—the Saus

-

surian decree marking out “the internal system of language.”

It is precisely these concepts that permitted the exclusion of writing: image or representation,

 

sensible and intelligible, nature and culture, nature and technics, etc. They are solidary with

 

all metaphysical conceptuality and particularly with a naturalist, objectivist, and derivative

 

determination of the difference between outside and inside.

And above all with a “vulgar concept of time.” I borrow this expression from Heidegger. It

 

designates, at the end of 

Being and Time, a 

concept of time thought in terms of spatial

 

movement or of the now, and dominating all philosophy from Aristotle’s 

Physics 

to Hegel’s

 

Logic. 34 

This concept, which determines all of classical ontology, was not bom out of a

 

philoso

pher’s carelessness or from a theoretical lapse. It is intrinsic to the totality of the

 

history of the Occident, of what unites its metaphysics and its technics. And we shall see it

 

later associated with the linearization of writing, and with the linearist concept of speech. This

 

linearism is undoubt

edly inseparable from phonologism; it can raise its voice to the same

 

extent that a linear writing can seem to submit to it. Saussure’s entire theory of the “linearity

 

of the signifier” could be interpreted from this point of view.

Auditory signifiers have at their command only the dimension of time. Their elements are

 

presented in succession; they form a chain. This feature becomes readily apparent when they

 

are represented in writing. . . . The signifier, being auditory, is unfolded solely in time from

 

which it gets the following char

acteristics: (a) it represents a span, and (b) the span is

 

measurable in a single dimension; it is a line. 

35

It is a point on which Jakobson disagrees with Saussure decisively by substituting for the

 

homogeneousness of the line the structure of the musi

cal staff, “the chord in music.” 36 What

 

is here in question is not Saussure’s affirmation of the temporal essence of discourse but the

 

concept of time that guides this affirmation and analysis: time conceived as linear suc

-

cessivity, as “consecutivity.” This model works by itself and all through the Course, but

 

Saussure is seemingly less sure of it in the 

Anagrams. 

At any rate, its value seems problematic

 

to him and an interesting paragraph elab-orates a question left suspended:

That the elements forming a word 

follow one another 

is a truth that it would be better for

 

linguistics not to consider uninteresting because evident, but rather as the truth which gives in

 

advance the central principle of all useful reflections on words. In a domain as infinitely

 

special as the one I am about to enter, it is always by virtue of the fundamental law of the

 

human word in general that a question like that of consecutiveness or nonconsecutiveness

 

may be posed. 37

This linearist concept of time is therefore one of the deepest adherences of the modem

 

concept of the sign to its own history. For at the limit, it is indeed the concept of the sign

 

itself, and the distinction, however tenuous, between the signifying and signified faces, that

 

remain committed to the history of classical ontology. The parallelism and correspondence of

 

the faces or the planes change nothing. That this distinction, first appearing in Stoic logic, was

 

necessary for the coherence of a scholastic thematics domi

nated by infinitist theology, forbids

 

us to treat today’s debt to it as a

((73))

contingency or a convenience. I suggested this at the outset, and perhaps the reasons are

 

clearer now. The 

signatum 

always referred, as to its referent, to 

a res, 

to an entity created or at

 

any rate first thought and spoken, thinkable and speakable, in the eternal present of the divine

 

logos and specifically in its breath. If it came to relate to the speech of a finite being (created

 

or not; in any case of an intracosmic entity) through the 

intermediary 

of a 

signans, 

the

 

signatum 

had an 

immediate 

relationship with the divine logos which thought it within

 

presence and for which it was not a trace. And for modem linguistics, if the signifier is a trace,

 

the signified is a meaning thinkable in principle within the full presence of an intuitive

 




consciousness. The signfied face, to the extent that it is still origi

narily distinguished from the

 

signifying face, is not considered a trace; by rights, it has no need of the signifier to be what it

 

is. It is at the depth of this affirmation that the problem of relationships between linguistics

 

and semantics must be posed. This reference to the meaning of a signified think-able and

 

possible outside of all signifiers remains dependent upon the onto

theo-teleology that I have

 

just evoked. It is thus the idea of the sign that must be deconstructed through a meditation

 

upon writing which would merge, as it must, with the undoing 

[sollicitation] 

* of onto-

theology, faith-fully repeating it in its 

totality 

and 

making 

it 

insecure 

in its most assured

 

evidences.38 One is necessarily led to this from the moment that the trace affects the totality

 

of the sign in both its faces. That the signified is originarily and essentially (and not only for a

 

finite and created spirit) trace, that it is always 

already in the position 

of 

the signifier, 

is the

 

ap

parently innocent proposition within which the metaphysics of the logos, of presence and

 

consciousness, must reflect upon writing as its death and its resource.

3. Of Grammatology as a Positive Science

On what conditions is a grammatology possible? Its fundamental condi

tion is certainly the

 

undoing 

[sollicitation] 

of logocentrism. But this con

dition of possibility turns into a condition

 

of impossibility. In fact it risks destroying the concept of science as well. Graphematics or

 

grammatography ought no longer to be presented as sciences; their goal should be ex

orbitant

 

when compared to grammatological 

knowledge.

Without venturing up to that perilous necessity, and within the tradi

tional norms of

 

scientificity upon which we fall back provisionally, let us repeat the question; on what

 

conditions is grammatology possible?

On the condition of knowing what writing is and how the plurivocity of this concept is

 

formed. Where does writing begin? When does writing begin? Where and when does the

 

trace, writing in general, common root of speech and writing, narrow itself down into

 

“writing” in the colloquial sense? Where and when does one pass from one writing to another,

 

from writing in general to writing in the narrow sense, from the trace to the 

graphie, 

from one

 

graphic system to another, and, in the field of a graphic code, from one graphic discourse to

 

another, etc.?

Where and how does it begin . . . ? 

A question of origin. But a medita

tion upon the trace

 

should undoubtedly teach us that there is no origin, that is to say simple origin; that the

 

questions of origin carry with them a metaphysics of presence. Without venturing here up to

 

that perilous neces

sity, continuing to ask questions of origin, we must recognize its two levels.

 

“Where” and “when” may open empirical questions: what, within history and within the

 

world, are the places and the determined moments of the first phenomena of writing? These

 

questions the investigation and research of facts must answer; history in the colloquial sense,

 




what has hitherto been practiced by nearly all archeologists, epigraphists, and pre-historians

 

who have interrogated the world’s scripts.

But the question of origin is at first confounded with the question of essence. It may just as

 

well be said that it presupposes an onto-phenomeno

logical question in the strict sense of that

 

term. One must know 

what 

writing is in order to ask—knowing what one is talking about and

 

what 

the

((75))

question 

is—where and when writing begins. What is writing? How can it be identified? What

 

certitude of essence must guide the empirical investi

gation? Guide it in principle, for it is a

 

necessary fact that empirical investi

gation quickly activates reflexion upon essence. 1 It must

 

operate through “examples,” and it can be shown how this impossibility of beginning at the

 

beginning of the straight line, as it is assigned by the logic of transcendental reflexion, refers

 

to the originarity (under erasure) of the trace, to the root of writing. What the thought of the

 

trace has already taught us is that it could not be simply submitted to the onto-

phenomenological question of essence. The trace 

is nothing, 

it is not an entity, it exceeds the

 

question 

What is? 

and contingently makes it possible. Here one may no longer trust even the

 

opposition of fact and principle, which, in all its metaphysical, on

tological, and transcendental

 

forms, has always functioned within the system of 

what is. 

Without venturing up to the

 

perilous necessity of the question on the arche-question “what is,” let us take shelter in the

 

field of grammatological knowledge.

Writing being thoroughly historical, it is at once natural and surprising that the scientific

 

interest in writing has always taken the form of a history of writing. But science also required

 

that a theory of writing should guide the pure description of facts, taking for granted that this

 

last expression has a sense.

Algebra: Arcanum and Transparence

The extent to which the eighteenth century, here marking a break-off point, attempted to

 

comply with these two exigencies, is too often ignored or underestimated. If for profound and

 

systematic reasons, the nineteenth century has left us a heavy heritage of illusions or

 

misunderstandings, all that concerns the theory of the written sign at the end of the

 

seventeenth and during the eighteenth centuries has suffered the consequences

. 2

We must learn to reread what has been thus confused for us. Madeleine V.-David, one of those

 

scholars who, in France, have untiringly kept alive the historical investigations of writing by

 

watching over the philosophical question, 

3

 has just collected in a valuable work the pieces

 

essential for a dossier: of a debate exciting the passions of all European minds at the end of

 

the seventeenth and all through the eighteenth centuries. A blinding and misunderstood

 

symptom of the crisis of European consciousness. The first plans for a “general history of

 

writing” (Warburton’s expression, dating from 1742) 

4 

were born in a milieu of thought where

 

proper scientific work had constantly to overcome the very thing that moved it: speculative

 

prejudice and ideological presumption. Critical work progresses by stages and its entire

 

strategy can be reconstructed after the fact. It first sweeps away the 

“theological” 

prejudice; it

 

is thus that Fréret qualifies the myth of

((76))




a primitive and natural writing given by God, as Hebrew script was for Blaise de Vigenère; in

 

his 

Traité des chi 

f 

fires ou secrètes manières d’escrire 

(1586), he says of these characters that

 

they are “the most ancient of all, formed indeed by the Lord God’s own finger. * In all its

 

forms, overt or covert, this theologism, which is actually something other and more than

 

prejudice, constituted the major obstacle to all grammatology. No history of writing could

 

come to terms with it. And especially no history of the very script of those whom this

 

theologism blinded: the alphabet, whether Greek or Hebrew. The element of the science of

 

writing had to remain in-visible within its history, and especially to those who could perceive

 

the history of other scripts. Thus there is nothing surprising in the fact that the necessary

 

decentering followed the becoming-legible of nonoccidental scripts. The history of the

 

alphabet is accepted only after recognizing the multiplicity of the 

systems 

of script and after

 

assigning a history to them, whether or not one is in the position to determine it scientifically.

This first decentering is, itself, limited. It is recentered upon ahistorical grounds which, in an

 

analogous way, reconcile the logico-philosophical (blindness to the condition of the logico-

philosophical: phonetic writing) ‘and the theological points of view. 5 It is the 

“Chinese”

 

prejudice; all the philosophical projects of a universal script and of a universal language,

 

pasilaly, polygraphy, invoked by Descartes, outlined by Father Kircher, Wilkins, 6 Leibniz,

 

etc., encouraged seeing in the recently discovered Chinese script a model of the philosophical

 

language thus removed from history. Such at any rate is the 

function 

of the Chinese model in

 

Leibniz’s projects. For him what liberates Chinese script from the voice is also that which,

 

arbitrarily and by the artifice of invention, wrenches it from history and gives it to philosophy.

The philosophical exigency that guided Leibniz had been formulated quite a few times before

 

him. Among all who inspired him, Descartes him-self comes first. Replying to Mersenne, who

 

had sent him (from a publica

tion unknown to us) an advertisement boasting a system of six

 

propositions for a universal language, Descartes begins by declaring all his distrust. 7 He

 

considers with disdain certain propositions which were, according to him, no more than “sales

 

talk” and “sales pitch.” And he has a “bad opinion of the word ‘arcanum’:” “as soon as I see

 

the word 

arcanum 

(mystery) in any proposition I begin to suspect it.” To this project he

 

opposes arguments that are, one will recall, 8 those of Saussure:

... [the] discordant combinations of letters which would often make the sounds unpleasant and

 

intolerable to the ear. It is to remedy this defect that all the differences in inflexions of words

 

have been introduced by usage; and it is

((77))

impossible for your author to have avoided the difficulty while making his I grammar

 

universal among different nations; for what is easy and pleasant in our language is coarse and

 

intolerable to Germans, and so on. 

This language would, in addition, require that the “primitive words” of all languages be

 

learnt; “this is too burdensome.”




Except for communicating them “through writing.” And it is an ad-vantage that Descartes

 

does not fail to recognize:

It is true that if each man uses as primitive words the words of his own language, he will not

 

have much difficulty, but in that case he will be under-stood only by the people of his own

 

country unless he writes down what he wants to say and the person who wants to understand

 

him takes the trouble to look up all the words in the dictionary; and this is too burdensome to

 

become a regular practice.... So the only possible benefit that I see from his invention would

 

be in the case of the written word. Suppose he had a big dictionary printed of all the languages

 

in which he wanted to make himself understood and put for each word a symbol

 

corresponding to the meaning and not to the syllables, a single symbol, for instance, for

 

aimer, amare, 

and 

philein: 

then those who had the dictionary and knew his grammar could

 

translate what was written into their own language by looking up each symbol in turn. But

 

this would be no good except for reading mysteries and revelations; in other cases no-one who

 

had anything better to do would take the trouble to look up all these words in a dictionary. So

 

I do not see that all this has much use. Perhaps I am wrong.

And with a profound irony, more profound perhaps than ironical, Descartes opines that error

 

may also result through a possible cause other than non-self-evidence, failure of attention, or

 

an over-hasty will: 

a fault of reading. 

The value of a system of language or writing is not

 

measured by the yardstick of intuition, of the clarity or the distinction of the idea, or of the

 

presence of the object as evidence. The system must itself be 

deciphered:

Perhaps I am wrong; I just wanted to write to you all I could conjecture on the basis of the six

 

propositions which you sent me. When you have seen the system, you will be able to say if I

 

worked it out correctly 

[déchiffrée] .

The profundity draws the irony further than it would go if it merely 

followed its author.

 

Further perhaps than the foundation of Cartesian certitude.

After which, in the form of note and postscript, Descartes defines the Leibnizian project very

 

simply. It is true that he sees the story of phi

losophy there; only philosophy may write it, for

 

philosophy depends on it totally, but by the same token, it can never hope “to see such a

 

language in use.”

((78))

The discovery of such a language depends upon the true philosophy. For without that

 

philosophy it is impossible to number and order all the thoughts of men or even to separate

 

them out into clear and simple thoughts, which in my opinion is the great secret for acquiring

 

true scientific knowledge. . . . I think it is possible to invent such a language and to discover

 

the science on which it depends: it would make [even] peasants better judges of the truth

 

about the world than philosophers are now. But do not hope ever to see such a language in

 

use. For that, the order of nature would have to change so that the world turned into a

 

terrestial paradise; and that is too much to suggest outside of fairyland 

.9

Leibniz expressly refers to this letter and to the 

analytical 

principle it formulates. The entire

 

project implies the decomposition into simple ideas. It is the only way to substitute calculation

 

for reasoning. In that sense, the universal characteristic depends on philosophy for its

 

principle but it may be undertaken without waiting for the completion of philosophy:




However, although this language depends on the true philosophy, it does not depend on its

 

perfection. In other words, this language can be established even if philosophy is not perfect;

 

and as man’s knowledge grows, this language will grow as well. Meanwhile it will be a great

 

help—for using what we know, for finding out what we lack, for inventing ways of redeeming

 

the lack, but espe

cially for settling controversies in matters that depend on reasoning. For then

 

reasoning and calculating will be the same thing.10

To be sure, these are not the only corrections of the Cartesian tradition. Descartes’s

 

analyticism is intuitionist, that of Leibniz points beyond mani-fest evidence, toward order,

 

relation, point of view.11

The characteristic economizes on the spirit and the imagination, whose expense must always

 

be husbanded. It is the principal goal of this great science that I am used to calling

 

Characteristic, 

of which what we call Algebra, or Analysis, is only a small branch; for it is

 

this science that gives speech to languages, letters to speech, numbers to arithmetic, notes to

 

music; it teaches us the secret of stabilizing reasoning, and of obliging it to leave visible

 

marks on the paper in a little volume, to be examined at leisure: finally, it makes us reason at

 

little cost, putting characters in the place of things in order to ease the imagination.12

In spite of all the differences that separate the projects of universal language or writing at this

 

time (notably with respect to history and language), 13 the concept of the simple absolute is

 

always necessarily and indispensably involved. It would be easy to show that it always leads

 

to an infinitist theology and to the logos or the infinite understanding of God.14 That is why,

 

appearances to the contrary, and, in spite of all the seduction that it can legitimately exercise

 

on our epoch, the Leibnizian project of a uni-versal characteristic that is not essentially

 

phonetic does not interrupt logocentrism in any way. On the contrary, universal logic confirms

 

logo-

((79))

centrism, is produced within it and with its help, exactly like the Hegelian critique to which it

 

will be subjected. I emphasize the complicity of these two contradictory movements. Within a

 

certain historical epoch, there is a profound unity among infinitist theology, logocentrism, and

 

a certain technicism. The originary and pre- or meta-phonetic writing that I am attempting to

 

conceive of here leads to nothing less than an “overtaking” of speech by the machine.

In an original and non-“relativist” sense, logocentrism is an ethnocentric metaphysics. It is

 

related to the history of the West. The Chinese model only apparently interrupts it when

 

Leibniz refers to it to teach the Char

acteristic. Not only does this model remain a domestic

 

representation,

15

 but also, it is praised only for the purpose of designating a lack and to define

 

the necessary corrections. What Leibniz is eager to borrow from Chinese writing is its

 

arbitrariness and therefore its independence with regard to history. This arbitrariness has an

 

essential link with the non-phonetic essence which Leibniz believes he can attribute to

 

Chinese writing. The latter seems to have been “invented by a deaf man” 

(New 

Essays) :

(Opuscules,

*

Elsewhere:




There are perhaps some artificial languages which are wholly of choice and entirely arbitrary,

 

as that of China is believed to have been, or as those of George Dalgamo and the late Mr.

 

Wilkins, bishop of Chester. 16

In a letter to Father Bouvet (1703), Leibniz is bent on distinguishing the Egyptian, popular,

 

sensory, allegorical writing from the Chinese, philo

sophical, and intellectual writing:

... Chinese characters are perhaps more philosophical and seem to be built upon more

 

intellectual considerations, such as are given by numbers, orders, and relations; thus there are

 

only detached strokes that do not culminate in some resemblances to a sort of body.

This does not prevent Leibniz from promising a script for which the Chinese would be only a

 

blueprint:

This sort of plan would at the same time yield a sort of universal script, which would have the

 

advantages of the Chinese script, for each person would under-stand it in his own language,

 

but which would infinitely surpass the Chinese,

xxx fotnote start xxx

•

Speech is to give the sign of one’s 

thought 

with an articulated voice. Writing is to do

 

it with permanent characters on paper. The latter need not be referred back to the voice, as is

 

obvious from the characters of the Chinese script.

xxx fotnote slutt xxx

((80))

in that it would be teachable in a few weeks, having characters perfectly linked according to

 

the order and connection of things, whereas, since Chinese script has an infinite number of

 

characters according to the variety of things, it takes the Chinese a lifetime to learn their script

 

adequately.17

The concept of Chinese writing thus functioned as a sort of European hallucination. This

 

implied nothing fortuitous: this functioning obeyed a rigorous necessity. And the hallucination

 

translated less an ignorance than a misunderstanding. It was not disturbed by the knowledge

 

of Chinese script, limited but real, which was then available.

At the same time as the “Chinese prejudice,” a 

“hieroglyphist prejudice” 

had produced the

 

same effect of interested blindness. The occultation, far from proceeding, as it would seem,

 

from ethnocentric scorn, takes the form of an hyperbolical admiration. We have not finished

 

verifying the necessity of this pattern. Our century is not free from it; each time that

 

ethnocentrism is precipitately and ostentatiously reversed, some effort si

lently hides behind

 

all the spectacular effects to consolidate an inside and to draw from it some domestic benefit.

 

The astonishing Father Kircher thus devoted his entire genius to opening the West to

 

Egyptology, 18 but the very excellence that he recognized in a “sublime” script forbade any

 

scientific deciphering of it. Evoking the 

Prodromus coptus sive aegyptiacus 

(1636), M. V.-

David writes:




This work is, in some of its parts, the first manifesto of Egyptological research, since in it the

 

author determines the 

nature of the ancient Egyptian language 

—the instrument of discovery

 

having been furnished him from elsewhere.* The same book however pushes aside all

 

projects of deciphering the hieroglyphs. * cf. 

Lingua aegyptiaca restituta. 

19

Here the process of nonrecognition through assimilation is not, as in Leibniz, of a rationalistic

 

and calculating kind. It is mystical:

According to the 

Prodromus, 

hieroglyphs are indeed a script, but not a script composed of

 

letters, words, and determined parts of speech that we generally use. They are a far finer and

 

more sublime script, closer to abstractions, which, by an ingenious linking of symbols, or its

 

equivalent, proposes 

at once (uno intuitu) 

to the intelligence of the scholar a complex

 

reasoning, elevated notions, or some mysterious insignia hidden in the breast of nature or the

 

Divinity 20

Between rationalism and mysticism there is, then, a certain complicity. The writing of the

 

other is each time invested with a domestic outline. What one might, following Bachelard,

 

call an “epistemological breach,” is brought about above all by Fréret and Warburton. One can

 

make out the laborious process of disentanglement by which both prepared their decision, the

 

former using the Chinese and the latter the Egyptian example.

((81))

With much respect for Leibniz and the project for a universal script, Fréret cuts to pieces the

 

representation of the Chinese script that is im-plied therein: “Chinese script is indeed not a

 

philosophical language which leaves nothing to be desired. . . . The Chinese have never had

 

anything like it.” 21

But, for all that, Fréret is not free of the hieroglyphist prejudice, which Warburton destroys by

 

violently criticizing Father Kircher. 

23

 The apolo

getic purpose that animates this critique does

 

not make it ineffectual.

It is in the theoretical field thus liberated that the scientific techniques of deciphering were

 

perfected by the Abbé Barthélemey and then by Champollion. Then a systematic reflection

 

upon the correspondence be

tween writing and speech could be bom. The greatest difficulty

 

was already to conceive, in a manner at once historical and systematic, the organized

 

cohabitation, within the same graphic code, of figurative, symbolic, ab

stract, and phonetic

 

elements. 24

Science and the Name of Man

Had grammatology entered upon the assured path of a science? To be sure, techniques of

 

deciphering went on progressing at an accelerated pace. 

25

 But the general histories of

 

writing, wherein devotion to systematic classification always oriented simple description,

 

were to be governed for a long time by theoretical concepts that are clearly not commensurate

 

with the great discoveries—discoveries that should have shaken the most assured foundations

 

of our philosophical conceptuality, entirely commanded by a situation determined by the

 

relationships between logos and writing. All the great histories of writing open with an

 

exposition of a classificatory and systematic project. But today one could transpose to the

 

domain of writing what Jakobson says of languages since Schlegel’s typological attempts:




.. , questions of typology retained a speculative, pre-scientific character for a long time. While

 

genetic grouping of languages made amazing progress, the time was not yet ripe for their

 

typological classification. (op. cit. p. 69) *

A systematic critique of the concepts used by historians of writing can seriously blame the

 

rigidity or the insufficient differentiation of a theo

retical apparatus only if it first locates the

 

false evidence that guides the work. Evidence all the more efficacious because it belongs to

 

the deepest, the oldest, and apparently the most natural, the least historical layer of our

 

conceptuality, that which best eludes criticism, and especially because it

((82))

supports that criticism, nourishes it, and informs it; our historical ground itself.

In all histories or general typologies of writing may be encountered a concession analogous to

 

the one that made Father Berger, author, in France, of the first big 

Histoire de l’écriture dans

 

l’antiquité 

(1892), say: “Most often the facts do not conform to the distinctions which . . . are

 

only exact in theory” (p. XX). Yet, the issue was nothing less than the distinctions between

 

phonetic and ideographic, syllabic and alphabetic, scripts, between image and symbol, etc.

 

The same may be said of the in

strumentalist and technicist concepts of writing, inspired by

 

the phonetic model which it does not conform to except through a teleological illusion, and

 

which the first contact with nonoccidental scripts ought to have de

molished. This

 

instrumentalism is implicit everywhere. Nowhere is it as systematically formulated, with all

 

the attendant consequences, as by Marcel Cohen: Language being an “instrument,” writing is

 

the “extension to an instrument.” 26 The exteriority of writing to speech, of speech to thought,

 

of the signifier to the signified in general, could not be described better. There is much food

 

for thought in the matter of the price thus paid by a linguistics—or by a grammatology—

which, in this case, professes to be Marxist, to the metaphysical tradition. But the same tribute

 

may be identi

fied everywhere: logocentric teleology (a pleonastic expression) ; opposi

tion

 

between nature and institution; play of differences between symbol, sign, image, etc., a naive

 

concept of representation; an uncritical opposition between sensible and intelligible, between

 

soul and body; an objectivist concept of the body proper 

[corps pro pre] 

and of the diversity

 

of sensory functions (the “five senses” considered as so many apparatuses at the disposition of

 

the speaker or writer); opposition between analysis and syn-thesis, abstract and concrete,

 

which plays a decisive role in the classifications proposed by Février and Cohen and in the

 

debate that opposes them; a concept of the concept upon which the most classical philosophic

 

reflec

tion has left little mark; a reference to consciousness and to the unconscious which

 

would necessarily invoke a more vigilant use of these notions and some consideration for

 

those studies that make these notions their theme; 27 a notion of the sign that philosophy,

 

linguistics, and semiology illuminate rarely and feebly. The competition between the history

 

of writing and the science of language is sometimes experienced in terms of hostility rather

 

than collaboration. Supposing, of course, that the competition is admitted. Thus, a propos of

 




the great distinction operated by Février between “syn

thetic writing” and “analytic writing,”

 

as also a propos of the “word” which plays for him a central role, the author notes: “The

 

problem is of the order of linguistics, we shall not deal with it here” (op. cit., p. 49).

 

Elsewhere, the noncommunication with linguistics is justified by Février in these terms :

((83))

[Mathematics] is a special language which no longer has any relationship with language, it is

 

a sort of universal language, that is to say we ascertain through mathematics that language—

vengeance upon linguists—is absolutely incapable of accommodating certain forms of

 

modern thought. And at present it is writ-ing, so badly misunderstood, that takes the place of

 

language, after having been its servant (EP, p. 349)

It can be shown that these presuppositions and all the oppositions thus accredited form a

 

system: we circulate from one to the other within the same structure.

Not only does the theory of writing need an intrascientific and epistemo

logical liberation,

 

analogous to the one brought about by Fréret and War

burton, without touching the layers of

 

which we speak there. Now a reflection must clearly be undertaken, within which the

 

“positive” discovery and the “deconstruction” of the history of metaphysics, in all its

 

concepts, are controlled reciprocally, minutely, laboriously. Without this, any epis

temological

 

liberation would risk being illusory or limited, proposing merely practical conveniences or

 

notional simplifications on bases that are un-touched by criticism. Such is undoubtedly the

 

limitation of the remarkable enterprise of I. J. Gelb (op. cit.); in spite of immense progress and

 

the project of erecting a grammatological scientificity and creating a unified system of simple,

 

supple, and manageable notions, in spite of the exclusion of inadequate concepts—such as of

 

the ideogram—most of the conceptual oppositions that I have just cited continue to function

 

there securely.

Through all the recent work in the area, one glimpses the future exten

sions of a grammatology

 

called upon to stop receiving its guiding concepts from other human sciences or, what nearly

 

always amounts to the same thing, from traditional metaphysics. A grammatology may be

 

surmised through the wealth and novelty of information, as well as through the treatment of

 

this information, even if, in these pioneering works, the con

ceptualization often falls short of a

 

bold and confident thrust.

What seems to announce itself now is, on the one hand, that gramma

tology must not be one of

 

the 

sciences of man 

and, on the other hand, that it must not be just one 

regional science

 

among others.

It ought not to be 

one of the sciences of man, 

because it asks first, as its characteristic

 

question, the question of the 

name of man. 

To free unity from the concept of man is

 

undoubtedly to renounce the old notion of peoples said to be “without writing” and “without

 

history.” André Leroi-Gourhan shows it well; to refuse the name of man and the ability to

 

write beyond its own proper community, is one and the same gesture. Actually, the peoples

 

said to be “without writing” lack only a certain type of writing. To refuse the name of writing

 

to this or that technique of consignment is the “ethnocentrism that best defines the

 

prescientific vision of man” and at the same time results in the fact that “in many human

 

groups, the




((84))

only word by which the members designate their ethnic group is the word ‘man’.” (GP pp. 32

 

and passim)

But it is not enough to denounce ethnocentrism and to define anthro

pological unity by the

 

disposition of writing. Leroi-Gourhan no longer describes the unity of man and the human

 

adventure thus by the simple possibility of the 

graphie 

in general; rather as a stage or an

 

articulation in the history of life—of what I have called differance—as the history of the

 

grammè. 

Instead of having recourse to the concepts that habitually serve to distinguish man

 

from other living beings (instinct and intelligence, absence or presence of speech, of society,

 

of economy, etc. etc.), the notion of 

program 

is invoked. It must of course be understood in

 

the cybernetic sense, but cybernetics is itself intelligible only in terms of a history of the

 

possibilities of the trace as the unity of a double movement of protention and retention. This

 

movement goes far beyond the possibilities of the “intentional consciousness.” It is an

 

emergence that makes the 

grammè 

appear 

as such 

(that is to say according to a new structure

 

of nonpresence) and undoubtedly makes possible the emergence of the systems of writing in

 

the narrow sense. Since “genetic inscription” and the “short programmatic chains” regulating

 

the behavior of the amoeba or the annelid up to the passage beyond alphabetic writing to the

 

orders of the logos and of a cer

tain 

homo sapiens, 

the possibility of the 

gramme 

structures the

 

movement of its history according to rigorously original levels, types, and rhythms. 28 But

 

one cannot think them without the most general concept of the 

gramme. 

That is irreducible

 

and impregnable. If the expression ventured by Leroi-Gourhan is accepted, one could speak of

 

a “liberation of memory,” of an exteriorization always already begun but always larger than

 

the trace which, beginning from the elementary programs of so-called “instinctive” behavior

 

up to the constitution of electronic card-indexes and reading machines, enlarges differance

 

and the possibility of putting in reserve: it at once and in the same movement constitutes and

 

effaces so-called conscious subjectivity, its logos, and its theological attributes.

The history of writing is erected on the base of the history of the 

grammè 

as an adventure of

 

relationships between the face and the hand. Here, by a precaution whose schema we must

 

constantly repeat, let us specify that the history of writing is not explained by what we believe

 

we know of the face and the hand, of the glance, of the spoken word, and of the gesture. We

 

must, on the contrary, disturb this familiar knowledge, and awaken a meaning of hand and

 

face in terms of that history. Leroi-Gourhan describes the slow transformation of manual

 

motricity which frees the audio-phonic system for speech, and the glance and the hand for

 

writing 29 In all these descriptions, it is difficult to avoid the mechanist, technicist, and

 

teleologi-cal language at the very moment when it is precisely a question of retriev

ing the

 

origin and the possibility of movement, of the machine, of the

((85))

tech?, 

of orientation in general. In fact, it is not difficult, it is essentially impossible. And this

 

is true of all discourse. From one discourse to another, the difference lies only in the mode of

 

inhabiting the interior of a con

ceptuality destined, or already submitted, to decay. Within that

 

conceptual

ity or already without it, we must attempt to recapture the unity of gesture and

 

speech, of body and language, of tool and thought, before the origi

nality of the one and the

 

other is articulated and without letting this profound unity give rise to confusionism. These

 

original significations must not be confused 

within the orbit 

of the system where they are

 




opposed. But to think the history of the system, its meaning and value must, in an 

exorbitant

 

way, be somewhere exceeded.

This representation of the 

anthropos is 

then granted: a precarious bal

ance linked to manual-

visual script. 30 This balance is slowly threatened. It is at least known that “no major change”

 

giving birth to “a man of the future” who will no longer be a “man,” “can be easily produced

 

without the loss of the hand, the teeth, and therefore of the upright position. A tooth-less

 

humanity that would exist in a prone position using what limbs it had left to push buttons

 

with, is not completely inconceivable.” 31

What always threatens this balance is confused with the very thing that broaches the 

linearity

 

of the symbol. We have seen that the traditional concept of time, an entire organization of the

 

world and of language, was bound up with it. Writing in the narrow sense—and phonetic

 

writing above all—is rooted in a past of nonlinear writing. It had to be defeated, and here one

 

can speak, if one wishes, of technical success; it assured a greater security and greater

 

possibilities of capitalization in a dangerous and anguishing world. But that was not done 

one

 

single time. 

A war was de

clared, and a suppression of all that resisted linearization was

 

installed. And first of what Leroi-Gourhan calls the “mythogram,” a writing that spells its

 

symbols pluri-dimensionally; there the meaning is not subjected to suc

cessivity, to the order

 

of a logical time, or to the irreversible temporality of sound. This pluri-dimensionality does

 

not paralyze history within simul

taneity, it corresponds to another level of historical

 

experience, and one may just as well consider, conversely, linear thought as a reduction of

 

history. It is true that another word ought perhaps to be used; the word history has no doubt

 

always been associated with a linear scheme of the unfolding of presence, where the line

 

relates the final presence to the originary presence according to the straight line or the circle.

 

For the same reason, the pluri-dimensional symbolic structure is not given within the category

 

of the simultaneous. Simultaneity coordinates two absolute pres

ents, two points or instants of

 

presence, and it remains a linearist concept.

The concept of 

linearization is 

much more effective, faithful, and in

trinsic than those that are

 

habitually used for classifying scripts and de-scribing their history (pictogram, ideogram,

 

letter, etc.). Exposing more

((86))

than one prejudice, particularly about the relationship between ideo

gram and pictogram, about

 

so-called graphic “realism,” Leroi-Gourhan recalls the unity, within the mythogram, of all the

 

elements of which linear writing marks the disruption: technics (particularly graphics), art,

 

religion, economy. To recover the access to this unity, to this other struc

ture of unity, we must

 

‘de-sediment “four thousand years of linear writing.” 

32

The linear norm was never able to impose itself absolutely for the very reasons that

 

intrinsically circumscribed graphic phoneticism. We now know them; these limits came into

 

being at the same time as the possi

bility of what they limited, they opened what they finished

 

and we have already named them: discreteness, differance, spacing. The production of the

 

linear norm thus emphasized these limits and marked the concepts of symbol and language.

 

The process of linearization, as Leroi-Gourhan de-scribes it on a very vast historical scale,

 

and the Jakobsonian critique of Saussure’s linearist concept, must be thought of together. The

 

“line” repre

sents only a particular model, whatever might be its privilege. This model 

has

 

become a 

model and, as a model, it remains inaccessible. If one allows that the linearity of

 




language entails this vulgar and mundane concept of temporality (homogeneous, dominated

 

by the form of the now and the ideal of continuous movement, straight or circular) which

 

Heidegger shows to be the intrinsic determining concept of all ontology from Aristotle to

 

Hegel, the meditation upon writing and the deconstruction of the history of philosophy

 

become inseparable.

The enigmatic model of the 

line is 

thus the very thing that philosophy could not see when it

 

had its eyes open on the interior of its own history. This night begins to lighten a little at the

 

moment when linearity—which is not loss or absence but the repression of pluri-dimensional

 

33 symbolic thought—relaxes its oppression because it begins to sterilize the technical and

 

scientific economy that it has long favored. In fact for a long time its possibility has been

 

structurally bound up with that of economy, of technics, and of ideology. This solidarity

 

appears in the process of thesaurization, capitalization, sedentarization, hierarchization, of the

 

for-mation of ideology by the class that writes or rather commands the scribes. 34 Not that the

 

massive reappearance of nonlinear writing interrupts this structural solidarity; quite the

 

contrary. But it transforms its nature profoundly.

The end of linear writing is indeed the end of the book, 

35

 even if, even today, it is within the

 

form of a book that new writings—literary or theo

retical—allow themselves to be, for better

 

or for worse, encased. It is less a question of confiding new writings to the envelope of a book

 

than of finally reading what wrote itself between the lines in the volumes. That is why, be-

ginning to write without the line, one begins also to reread past writing according to a

 

different organization of space. If today the problem of read-

((87))

ing occupies the forefront of science, it is because of this suspense between two ages of

 

writing. Because we are beginning to write, to write differently, we must reread differently.

For over a century, this uneasiness has been evident in philosophy, in science, in literature. All

 

the revolutions in these fields can be interpreted as shocks that are gradually destroying the

 

linear model. Which is to say the 

epic 

model. What is thought today cannot be written

 

according to the line and the book, except by imitating the operation implicit in teaching

 

modem mathematics with an abacus. This inadequation is not 

modern, 

but it is exposed today

 

better than ever before. The access to pluri

dimensionality and to a delinearized temporality is

 

not a simple regression toward the “mythogram;” on the contrary, it makes all the rationality

 

sub

jected to the linear model appear as another form and another age of mythography. The

 

meta-rationality or the meta-scientificity which are thus announced within the meditation

 

upon writing can therefore be no more shut up within a science of man than conform to the

 

traditional idea of science. In one and the same gesture, they leave 

man, science, 

and the 

line

 

behind.

Even less can this meditation be contained within the limits of a 

regional science.

The Rebus and the Complicity of Origins

Were it a graphology. And even a graphology renewed and fertilized by sociology, history,

 

ethnography, and psychoanalysis.




Since individual markings reveal the particularities of the mind of those who write, the

 

national markings should permit to a certain extent researches into the particularities of the

 

collective mind of peoples 36

Such a cultural graphology, however legitimate its project might be, can come into being and

 

proceed with some certitude only when the more general and fundamental problems have

 

been elucidated; as to the articula

tion of an individual and a collective 

graphie, 

of the graphic

 

“discourse”—so to speak—and the graphic “code,” considered not from the point of view of

 

the intention of signification or of denotation, but of style and connota

tion; problems of the

 

articulation of graphic forms and of diverse sub-stances, of the diverse forms of graphic

 

substances (materials: wood, wax, skin, stone, ink, metal, vegetable) or instruments (point,

 

brush, etc., etc.); as to the articulation of the technical, economic, or historical levels (for

 

example, at the moment when a graphic 

system is 

constituted and at the moment, which is not

 

necessarily the same, when a graphic 

style is 

fixed); as to the limit and the sense of variations

 

in style within the system; as to all the investitures to which 

a graphie, 

in form and substance,

 

is submitted.

((88))

From this latter point of view, a certain privilege should be given to re-search of the

 

psychoanalytic type. In as much as it touches the originary constitution of objectivity and of

 

the value of the object—the constitution of 

good 

and 

bad 

objects as categories that do not

 

allow themselves to be derived from a 

theoretical 

formal ontology and from a science of the

 

objectivity of the object in general—psychoanalysis is not a simple regional science,

 

although, as its name indicates, it is presented under the heading of psychology. That it

 

adheres to this title is certainly not a matter of indif

ference and hints at a certain state of

 

criticism and epistemology. Never

theless, even if psychoanalysis did not achieve the

 

transcendentality—under erasure—of the arche-trace, even if it remained a mundane science,

 

its generality would have a controlling meaning with regard to all local science. Here I am

 

quite obviously thinking of researches of the type under-taken by Melanie Klein. An example

 

of it may be found in the essay on 

“The Role 

of 

the School in the Libidinal Development of

 

the Child”37 

which evokes, from the clinical point of view, all the investments with which the

 

operations of reading and writing, the production and manage-ment of the number, etc., are

 

charged. To the extent that the constitution of ideal objectivity must essentially pass through

 

the written signifier, 38 no theory of this constitution has the right to neglect the investments

 

of writing. These investments not only retain an opacity in the ideality of the object, but

 

permit the liberation of that ideality. It gives the force without which an objectivity in general

 

would not be possible. I do not dissimulate the gravity of such an affirmation and the

 

immense difficulty of the task thus assigned to both the theory of objectivity and

 

psychoanalysis. But the necessity is commensurate with the difficulty.

It is in his very work that the historian of writing encounters this neces

sity. His problems

 

cannot be grasped except at the root of all sciences. Reflection on the essence of mathematics,

 

politics, economics, religion, technology, law, etc., communicates most intimately with the

 

reflection upon and the information surrounding the history of writing. The con

tinuous vein

 

that circulates through all these fields of reflection and con

stitutes their fundamental unity is

 

the problem of the phoneticization of writing. This phoneticization has a history, no script is

 

absolutely exempt from it, and the enigma of this evolution does not allow itself to be domi

-

nated by the concept of history. To be sure, the latter appears at a deter-mined moment in the

 

phoneticization of script and it presupposes pho

neticization in an essential way.




On this subject, what does the most massive, most recent, and least contestable information

 

teach us? First, that for structural or essential reasons, a purely phonetic writing is impossible

 

and has never finished reducing the nonphonetic. The distinction between phonetic and non-

phonetic writing, although completely indispensable and legitimate, re-

((89))

mains very derivative with regard to what may be called a synergy and a fundamental

 

synesthesia. It follows that not only has phoneticization never been omnipotent but also that it

 

has always already begun to under-mine the mute signifier. “Phonetic” and “nonphonetic” are

 

therefore never pure qualities of certain systems of writing, they are the abstract

 

characteristics of typical elements, more or less numerous and dominant within all systems of

 

signification in general. Their importance owes less to their quantitative distribution than to

 

their structural organization. The cuneiform, for example, is at the same time ideogrammatic

 

and phonetic. And, indeed, one cannot say that each graphic signifier belongs to such and

 

such a class, the cuneiform code playing alternately on two registers. In fact, each graphic

 

form may have a 

double 

value—ideographic and phonetic. And its phonetic value can be

 

simple or complex. The same sig

nifier may have one or various phonic values, it may be

 

homophonic 

or 

polyphonic. 

To this general complexity of the system is added yet another

 

subtle recourse to categorical determinatives, to phonetic complements useless in reading, to a

 

very irregular punctuation. And Labat shows that it is impossible to understand the system

 

without going through its history. 39

This is true of all systems of writing and does not depend upon what is sometimes hastily

 

considered to be levels of elaboration. Within the struc

ture of a pictographic tale for example,

 

a representation-of-a-thing, such as a totemic blazon, may take the symbolic value of a proper

 

name. From that moment on, it can function as apellation within other series with a phonetic

 

value. 40 Its stratification may thus become very complex and go beyond the empirical

 

consciousness 

linked to their immediate usage. Going beyond this real consciousness, the

 

structure of this signifier may continue to oper

ate not only on the fringes of the potential

 

consciousness but according to the causality of the unconscious.

Thus the name, especially the so-called proper name, is always caught in a chain or a system

 

of differences. It becomes an appellation only to the extent that it may inscribe itself within a

 

figuration. Whether it be linked by its origin to the representations of things in space or

 

whether it remains caught in a system of phonic differences or social classifications

 

apparently released from ordinary space, the proper-ness of the name does not escape spacing.

 

Metaphor shapes and undermines the proper name. The literal 

[propre] 

meaning does not

 

exist, its “appearance” is a necessary function—and must be analyzed as such—in the system

 

of differences and metaphors. The absolute parousia of the literal meaning, as the presence to

 

the self of the logos within its voice, in the absolute hearing-itself-speak, should be 

situated 

as

 

a function responding to an indestructible but relative neces

sity, within a system that

 

encompasses it. That amounts to 

situating 

the metaphysics or the ontotheology of the logos.

((90))

The problem of the picture-puzzle 

(rébus à transfert) 

brings together all the difficulties. As

 

pictogram, a representation of the thing may find itself endowed with a phonetic value. This

 

does not efface the “pictographic” ref

erence which, moreover, has never been simply

 

“realistic.” The signifier is broken or constellated into a system: it refers at once, and at least,

 




to a thing and to a sound. The thing is itself a collection of things or a chain of differences “in

 

space;” the sound, which is also inscribed within a chain, may be a word; the inscription is

 

then ideogrammatical or synthetic, it can-not be decomposed; but the sound may also be an

 

atomic element itself entering into the composition: we are dealing then with a script

 

apparently pictographic and in fact phonetico-analytical in the same way as the alpha-bet.

 

What is now known of the writing of the Aztecs of Mexico seems to cover all these

 

possibilities.

Thus the proper name 

Teocaltitlan 

is broken into several syllables, rendered by the following

 

images: lips 

(tentli), 

road 

(otlim), 

house 

(calli), 

and finally tooth 

(tla

.

nti). 

The procedure is

 

closely bound up with that . . . of suggesting the name of a person by images of the beings or

 

things that go into the making of his name. The Aztecs achieved a greater degree of

 

phoneticism. By having recourse to a truly phonetic analysis, they succeeded in rendering

 

separate sounds through images 41

The work of Barthel and Knorosov * on the Mayan glyphs do not lead to harmonious results,

 

their progress remains very slow, but the presence of phonetic elements now seems almost

 

certain. And the same is true of the writing of the Easter Islands. 42 Not only is the latter

 

picto-ideo-phono

graphic, but in the very interior of its non-phonetic structures, equivocity and

 

overdetermination can give rise to metaphors taken over by a true 

graphic rhetoric, 

if this

 

absurd expression may be risked.

We shall now discover the complexity of this structure in the so-called “primitive” scripts and

 

in cultures believed “without writing.” But we have known for a long time that largely

 

nonphonetic scripts like Chinese or Japanese included phonetic elements very early. They

 

remained structurally dominated by the ideogram or algebra and we thus have the testimony

 

of a powerful movement of civilization developing outside of all logocentrism. Writing did

 

not reduce the voice to itself, it incorporated it into a system:

This script had more or less recourse to phonetic borrowings, certain signs being used for

 

their sound independently of their original meaning. But this phonetic

((91))

use of signs could never become extensive enough to corrupt Chinese writing in principle and

 

lead it onto the path of phonetic notation. . . . Writing in China, never having 

reached a

 

phonetic analysis of language, was never felt to be a more or less faithful transference

 

[décalque] 

of speech, and that is why the graphic sign, symbol of a reality singular and

 

unique like itself, has retained much of its primitive prestige. There is no reason for believing

 




that 

in antiquity 

speech in China had not the same efficaciousness as writing, but it was

 

possible for its power to have been partly 

eclipsed 

by writing. On the contrary, in civili

zations

 

where writing evolved toward syllabification and the alphabet early enough, it is the word

 

which concentrated in itself, definitively, all the powers of religious and magical creation.

 

And in fact it is remarkable that in China this strange valorization of speech, word, syllable, or

 

vowel, attested in all great ancient civilizations from the Mediterranean basin to India, is not

 

encountered. 43

It is difficult not to subscribe to this analysis globally. Let us note, how-ever, that it seems to

 

consider “the phonetic analysis of language” and phonetic writing as a normal “outcome,” as

 

an historical telos 

within sight 

of which, like a ship steering to port, Chinese script had to an

 

extent run aground. Can it be thought that the system of Chinese script is thus a sort of

 

unfulfilled alphabet? On the other hand, Gernet seems to explain the “primitive prestige” of

 

Chinese graphism by its “symbolic” relationship with a “reality singular and unique like

 

itself.” Is it not evident that no signifier, whatever its substance and form, has a “unique and

 

singular reality?” A signifier is from the very beginning the possibility of its own repetition, of

 

its own image or resemblance. It is the condition of its ideal

ity, what identifies it as signifier,

 

and makes it function as such, relating it to a signified which, for the same reasons, could

 

never be a “unique and singular reality.” From the moment that the sign appears, that is to say

 

from the very beginning, there is no chance of encountering anywhere the purity of “reality,”

 

“unicity,” “singularity.” So by what right can it be supposed that speech could have had, “in

 

antiquity,” before the birth of Chinese writing, the sense and value that we know in the West?

 

Why would speech in China have had to be “eclipsed” by writing? If one wishes really to

 

penetrate to the thing that, under the name of writing, separates much more than techniques of

 

notation, should one not get rid, among other ethnocentric presuppositions, also of a sort of

 

graphic monogenetism that transforms all differences into divergences or delays, accidents or

 

deviations? And examine this heliocentric concept of speech? As well as the resem

blance of

 

the logos to the sun (to the good or to the death that one cannot look at face to face), to the

 

king or to the father (the good or the intelli

gible sun are compared to the father in the

 

Republic, 5o8 c)? 

What must writing be in order to threaten this analogical system in its

 

vulnerable and secret center? What must it be in order to signify the 

eclipse 

of what is

((92))

good 

and of the 

father? 

Should one not stop considering writing as the eclipse that comes to

 

surprise and obscure the glory of the word? And if there is some necessity of eclipse, the

 

relationship of shadow and light, of writing and speech, should it not itself appear in a

 

different way?

In a different way: the necessary decentering cannot be a philosophic or scientific act as such,

 

since it is a question of dislocating, through access to another system linking speech and

 

writing, the founding categories of lan

guage and the grammar of the 

e pistémè. 

The natural

 

tendency of 

theory—

of what unites philosophy and science in the epistémè—will push rather

 

toward filling in the breach than toward forcing the closure. It was normal that the

 

breakthrough was more secure and more penetrating on the side of literature and poetic

 

writing: normal also that it, like Nietzsche, at first destroyed and caused to vacillate the

 

transcendental authority and domi

nant category of the 

epistémè: 

being. This is the meaning of

 

the work of Fenellosa 44 whose influence upon Ezra Pound and his poetics is well-known:

 

this irreducibly graphic poetics was, with that of Mallarmé, the first break in the most

 




entrenched Western tradition. The fascination that the Chinese ideogram exercised on Pound’s

 

writing may thus be given all its historical significance.

Ever since phoneticization has allowed itself to be questioned in its origin, its history and its

 

adventures, its movement is seen to mingle with that of science, religion, politics, economy,

 

technics, law, art. The origins of these movements and these historical regions dissociate

 

them-selves, as they must for the rigorous delimitation of each science, only by an abstraction

 

that one must constantly be aware of and use with vigilance. This complicity of origins may

 

be called arche-writing. What is lost in that complicity is therefore the myth of the simplicity

 

of origin. This myth is linked to the very concept of origin; to speech reciting the origin, to the

 

myth of the origin and not only to myths of origin.

The fact that access to the written sign assures the sacred power of keep-ing existence

 

operative within the trace and of knowing the general struc

ture of the universe; that all

 

clergies, exercising political power or not, were constituted at the same time as writing and by

 

the disposition of graphic power; that strategy, ballistics, diplomacy, agriculture, fiscality, and

 

penal law are linked in their history and in their structure to the constitution of writing; that

 

the origin assigned to writing had been—according to the chains and mythemes—always

 

analogous in the most diverse cultures and that it communicated in a complex but regulated

 

manner with the dis

tribution of political power as with familial structure; that the possibility

 

of capitalization and of politico-administrative organization had always passed through the

 

hands of scribes who laid down the terms of many wars and whose function was always

 

irreducible, whoever the contending parties might be; that through discrepancies, inequalities

 

of development, the play

((93))

of permanencies, of delays, of diffusions, etc., the solidarity among ideologi-cal, religious,

 

scientific-technical systems, and the systems of writing which were therefore more and other

 

than “means of communication” or vehicles of the signified, remains indestructible; that the

 

very sense of power and effectiveness in general, which could appear as such, as meaning and

 

mas-tery (by idealization), only with so-called “symbolic” power, was always linked with the

 

disposition of writing; that economy, monetary or pre-monetary, and graphic calculation were

 

co-originary, that there could be no law without the possibility of trace (if not, as H. Lévy-

Bruhl shows, of notation in the narrow sense), all this refers to a common and radical possi

-

bility that no determined science, no abstract discipline, can think as such. 

45

Indeed, one must understand this 

incompetence 

of science which is also the incompetence of

 

philosophy, the 

closure 

of the 

epistémè. 

Above all it does not invoke a return to a prescientific

 

or infra-philosophic form of dis-course. Quite the contrary. This common root, which is not a

 

root but the concealment of the origin and which is not common because it does not amount to

 

the same thing except with the unmonotonous insistence of difference, this unnameable

 

movement of 

difference-itself, 

that I have stra

tegically nicknamed 

trace, reserve, 

or

 

differance, 

could be called writing only within the 

historical 

closure, that is to say within the

 

limits of science and philosophy.

The constitution of a science or a philosophy of writing is a necessary and difficult task. But,

 

a thought 

of the trace, of differance or of reserve, having arrived at these limits and repeating

 

them ceaselessly, must also point beyond the field of the 

epistémè. 

Outside of the economic

 

and stra

tegic reference to the name that Heidegger justifies himself in giving to an analogous

 




but not identical transgression of all philosophemes, 

thought 

is here for me a perfectly neutral

 

name, the blank part of the text, the neces

sarily indeterminate index of a future epoch of

 

differance. 

In a certain sense, “thought” means nothing. 

Like all openings, this index belongs

 

within a past epoch by the face that is open to view. This thought has no weight. It is, in the

 

play of the system, that very thing which never has weight. Think-ing is what we already

 

know we have not yet begun; measured against the shape of writing, it is 

broached 

only in the

 

epistémè.

Grammatology, this thought, would still be walled-in within presence.

((97))

Introduction to the “Age of Rousseau”

In the voice we have an organ answering to hearing; we have no such organ answering to

 

sight, and we do not repeat colours as we repeat sounds. This supplies an additional means

 

of cultivating the ear by practising the active and passive organs one with the other.

—Emile

If one had faith in the organization of a classical reading, one would per

haps say that I had

 

just proposed a double grid: 

historical 

and 

systematic. 

Let us pretend to believe in this

 

opposition. Let us do it for the sake of con

venience, for I hope that the reasons for my

 

suspicion are by now clear enough. Since I am about to deal with what, using the same

 

language and with as much caution, I call an 

“example,” 

I must now justify my choice.

Why accord an “exemplary” value to the “age of Rousseau”? What privi

leged place does

 

Jean-Jacques Rousseau occupy in the history of logocen

trism? What is meant by that proper

 

name? And what are the relationships between that proper name and the texts to which it was

 

underwritten? I do not profess to bring to these questions anything more than the beginning of

 

an answer, perhaps only the beginning of an elaboration, limited to the preliminary

 

organization of the question. This work will present itself gradually. I cannot therefore justify

 

it by way of anticipation and preface. Let us nevertheless attempt an overture.

If the history of metaphysics is the history of a determination of being as presence, if its

 

adventure merges with that of logocentrism, and if it is produced wholly as the reduction of

 

the trace, Rousseau’s work seems to me to occupy, between Plato’s 

Phaedrus 

and Hegel’s

 

Encyclopaedia, a 

singular position. What do these three landmarks signify?

Between the overture and the philosophical accomplishment of pho

nologism (or

 

logocentrism), the motif of presence was decisively articu

lated. It underwent an internal

 




modification whose most conspicuous index was the moment of certitude in the Cartesian

 

cogito. Before that, the identity of presence offered to the mastery of repetition was

 

constituted under the “objective” form of the ideality of the 

eidos 

or the substantiality of

 

ousia. 

Thereafter, this objectivity takes the form of 

representation, 

of the 

idea 

as the

 

modification of a self-present substance, conscious and certain of itself at the moment of its

 

relationship to itself. Within its most general form, the mastery of presence acquires a sort of

 

infinite assurance. The

((98))

power of repetition that the 

eidos 

and 

ousia 

made available seems to acquire an absolute

 

independence. Ideality and substantiality relate to themselves, in the element of the 

res

 

cogitans, 

by a movement of pure auto-affection. Consciousness is the experience of pure auto-

affection. It calls itself infalli

ble and if the axioms of 

natural reason 

give it this certitude,

 

overcome the provocation of the Evil Spirit, and prove the existence of God, it is because they

 

constitute the very element of thought and of self-presence. Self-presence is not disturbed by

 

the divine origin of these axioms. The infinite alterity of the divine substance does not

 

interpose itself as an element of mediation or opacity in the transparence of self-relationship

 

and the purity of auto-affection. God is the name and the element of that which makes

 

possible an absolutely pure and absolutely self-present self-knowledge. From Descartes to

 

Hegel and in spite of all the differences that separate the dif

ferent places and moments in the

 

structure of that epoch, God’s infinite understanding is the other name for the logos as self-

presence. The logos can be infinite and self-present, it can be 

produced as auto-affection, 

only

 

through the 

voice: 

an order of the signifier by which the subject takes from itself into itself,

 

does not borrow outside of itself the signifier that it emits and that affects it at the same time.

 

Such is at least the experience—or consciousness—of the voice: of hearing (understanding)-

oneself-speak 

[s’entendre-parler]. 

That experience lives and proclaims itself as the ex

clusion

 

of writing, that is to say of the invoking of an “exterior,” “sensible,” “spatial” signifier

 

interrupting self-presence.

Within this age of metaphysics, between Descartes and Hegel, Rous-seau is undoubtedly the

 

only one or the first one to make a theme or a sys

tem of the reduction of writing profoundly

 

implied by the entire age. He repeats the inaugural movement of the 

Phaedrus 

and of 

De

 

interpretations 

but starts from a new model of presence: the subject’s self-presence within

 

consciousness 

or 

feeling. 

What he excluded more violently than others must, of course, have

 

fascinated and tormented him more than it did others. Descartes had driven out the sign—and

 

particularly the written sign —from the cogito and from clear and distinct evidence; the latter

 

being the very presence of the idea to the soul, the sign was an accessory abandoned in the

 

region of the senses and of the imagination. Hegel reappropriates the sensible sign to the

 

movement of the Idea. He criticizes Leibniz and praises phonetic writing within the horizon of

 

an absolutely self-present logos, remaining close to itself within the unity of its speech and its

 

con

cept. But neither Descartes nor Hegel grappled with the problem of writ-ing. The place of

 

this combat and crisis is called the eighteenth century. Not only because it restores the rights

 

of sensibility, the imagination, and the sign, but because attempts of the Leibnizian type had

 

opened a breach within logocentric security. We must bring to light what it was that, right

((99))

from the start, within these attempts at a universal characteristic, limited the power and extent

 

of the breakthrough. Before Hegel and in explicit terms, Rousseau condemned the universal

 




characteristic; not because of the theological foundation which ordained its possibility for the

 

infinite under-standing or logos of God, but because it seemed to suspend the voice.

 

“Through” this condemnation can be read the most energetic eight

eenth-century 

reaction

 

organizing the defense of phonologism and of logo-centric metaphysics. What threatens is

 

indeed writing. It is not an acci

dental and haphazard threat; it reconciles within a single

 

historical system the projects of 

pasigraphy, 

the discovery of non-European scripts, or at any

 

rate the massive progress of the techniques of 

deciphering, 

and finally the idea of a 

general

 

science of language and writing. 

Against all these pressures, a battle is then declared.

 

“Hegelianism” will be its finest scar.

The names of authors or of doctrines have here no substantial value. They indicate neither

 

identities nor causes. It would be frivolous to think that “Descartes,” “Leibniz,” “Rousseau,”

 

“Hegel,” etc., are names of authors, of the authors of movements or displacements that we

 

thus designate. The indicative value that I attribute to them is first the name of a problem. If I

 

provisionally authorize myself to treat this historical struc

ture by fixing my attention on

 

philosophical or literary texts, it is not for the sake of identifying in them the origin, cause, or

 

equilibrium of the struc

ture. But as I also do not think that these texts are the simple 

effects 

of

 

structure, in any sense of the word; as I think that 

all concepts hitherto proposed in order to

 

think the articulation of a discourse and of an his

torical totality are caught within the

 

metaphysical closure that I question here, 

as we do not know of any other concepts and

 

cannot produce any others, and indeed shall not produce so long as this closure limits our

 

discourse; as the primordial and indispensable phase, in fact and in princi

ple, of the

 

development of this problematic, consists in questioning the internal structure of these texts as

 

symptoms; as that is the only condition for determining these symptoms 

themselves 

in the

 

totality of their meta-physical appurtenance; I draw my argument from them in order to

 

isolate Rousseau, and, in Rousseauism, the theory of writing. Besides, this abstrac

tion is

 

partial and it remains, in my view, provisional. Further on, I shall directly approach the

 

problem within a “question of method.”

Beyond these broad and preliminary justifications, other urgencies should be invoked. In

 

Western and notably French thought, the dominant dis

course—let us call it “structuralism”—

remains caught, by an entire layer, sometimes the most fecund, of its stratification, within the

 

metaphysics

logocentrism—which at the same time one claims rather precipitately to have

 

“gone beyond.” If I have chosen the example of the texts of Claude Lévi-Strauss, as points of

 

departure and as a springboard for a reading of

((100))

Rousseau, it is for more than one reason; for the theoretical wealth and interest of those texts,

 

for the animating role that they currently play, but also for the place occupied in them by the

 

theory of writing and the theme of fidelity to Rousseau. They will, therefore, in this study, be

 

somewhat more than an exergue.

((101))

1. The Violence of the Letter: From Lévi-Strauss to

 

Rousseau




Shall I proceed to the teaching of writing? No, I am ashamed to toy with these trifles in a

 

treatise on education.

—Emile

It [writing] seems to favor rather the exploitation than the enlightenment of mankind....

 

Writing, on this its first appearance in their midst, had allied itself with falsehood.

—“A

 

Writing Lesson,” 

Tristes Tropiques.*

Metaphysics has constituted an exemplary system of defense against the threat of writing.

 

What links writing to violence? What must violence be in order for something in it to be

 

equivalent to the operation of the trace?

And 

why bring this question into play within the affinity or filiation that binds Lévi-Strauss 

to

 

Rousseau? Another 

difficulty is added to the problem of the justification of this historical

 

contraction; what is a lineage in the order of discourse and text? If in a rather conventional

 

way I call by the name of 

discourse 

the present, living, conscious 

representation 

of a 

text

 

within the experience of the person who writes or reads it, and if the text constantly goes

 

beyond this representation by the entire system of its re-sources and its own laws, then the

 

question of genealogy exceeds by far the possibilities that are at present given for its

 

elaboration. We know that the metaphor that would describe the genealogy of a text correctly

 

is still 

forbidden. 

In its syntax and its lexicon, in its spacing, by its punctuation, its lacunae, its

 

margins, the historical appurtenance of a text is never a straight line. It is neither causality by

 

contagion, nor the simple accumulation of layers. Nor even the pure juxtaposition of

 

borrowed pieces. And if a text always gives itself a certain representation of its own roots,

 

those roots live only by that representation, by never touching the soil, so to speak. Which

 

undoubtedly destroys their 

radical essence, 

but not the necessity of their 

racinating function.

 

To say that one always interweaves roots endlessly, bending them to send down roots among

 

the roots, to pass through the

same points again, to redouble old adherences, to circulate among their differences, to coil

 

around themselves or to be enveloped one in the other, to say that a text is never anything but

 

a 

system 

of 

roots, is 

undoubtedly to contradict at once the concept of system and the pattern of

 

the root. But in order not to be pure appearance, this contradiction takes on the meaning of a

 

contradiction, and receives its “illogicality,” only through being thought within a finite

 

configuration—the history of metaphysics—and caught within a root system which does not

 

end there and which as yet has no name.

The text’s self-consciousness, the circumscribed discourse where genea

logical representation

 

is articulated (what Lévi-Strauss, for example, makes of a certain “eighteenth century,” by

 

quoting it as the source of his thought), without being confused with genealogy itself, plays,

 

precisely by virtue of this divergence, an organizing role in the structure of the text. Even if

 

one did have the right to speak of retrospective illusion, it would not be an accident or a

 




theoretical falling off; one would have to account for its necessity and its positive effects. A

 

text always has several epochs and reading must resign itself to that fact. And this

 

genealogical self-representation is itself already the representation of a self-representation;

 

what, for example, “the French eighteenth century,” if such a thing existed, already

 

constructed as its own source and its own presence.

Is the play of these appurtenances, so manifest in texts of anthropology and the “sciences of

 

man,” produced totally within a “history of meta-physics?” Does it somewhere force the

 

closure? Such is perhaps the widest horizon of the questions which will be supported by a few

 

examples here. To which proper names may be assigned: the sustainers of the discourse,

 

Condillac, Rousseau, Lévi-Strauss; or common names: concepts of analysis, of genesis, of

 

origin, of nature, of culture, of sign, of speech, of writing, etc.; in short, the common name of

 

the proper name.

In linguistics as well as in metaphysics, 

phonologism is 

undoubtedly the exclusion or

 

abasement of writing. But it is also the granting of authority to a science which is held to be

 

the model for all the so-called sciences of man. In both these senses Lévi-Strauss’s

 

structuralism is a phonologism. As for the “models” of linguistics and phonology, what I have

 

already brought up will not let me skirt around a structural anthropology upon which

 

phonological science exercises so 

declared a 

fascination, as for in-stance in “Language and

 

Kinship”; 1 it must be questioned line by line.

The advent of structural linguistics 

[phonologie] 

completely changed this situation. Not only

 

did it renew linguistic perspectives; a transformation of this

((103))

magnitude is not limited to a single discipline. Structural linguistics will cer

tainly play the

 

same renovating role with respect to the social sciences that nuclear physics, for example, has

 

played for the physical sciences 

[l’ensemble des sciences exactes] (p. 

39) [p. 31].

If we wished to elaborate the question of the 

model, 

we would have to examine all the “as”-s

 

and “likewise”-s that punctuate the argument, order-ing and authorizing the analogy between

 

phonology and sociology, between phonemes and the terms of kinship. “A striking analogy,”

 

we are told, but the functioning of its “as” shows us quickly enough that this is a very in-

fallible but very impoverished generality of structural laws, no doubt gov

erning the systems

 

considered, but also dominating many other systems without privilege; a phonology

 

exemplary as the example in a series and not as the regulative model. But on this terrain

 

questions have been asked, objections articulated; and as the 

epistemological 

phonologism

 

establishing a science as a master-model presupposes a 

linguistic 

and 

metaphysical

 

phonologism that raises speech above writing, it is this last that I shall first try to identify.

For Lévi-Strauss has written of writing. Only a few pages, to be sure 

2

 but in many respects

 

remarkable; very fine pages, calculated to amaze, enunciating in the form of paradox and

 

modernity the anathema that the Western world has obstinately mulled over, the exclusion by

 

which it has constituted and recognized itself, from the 

Phaedrus 

to the 

Course in General

 

Linguistics.




Another reason for rereading Lévi-Strauss: if, as I have shown, writing cannot be felt without

 

an unquestioning faith in the entire system of differences between 

physis 

and its other (the

 

series of its “others:” art, technology, law, institution, society, immotivation, arbitrariness,

 

etc.), and in all the conceptuality disposed within it, then one should follow with the closest

 

attention the troubled path of a thinker who sometimes, at a certain stage in his reflections,

 

bases himself on this difference, and sometimes leads us to its point of effacement: “The

 

opposition between nature and culture to which I attached much importance at one time .. .

 

now seems to be of primarily methodological importance.” 3 Undoubtedly Lévi-Strauss has

 

only traveled from one point of effacement to another. 

Les structures élémentaires de la

(1949),* dominated by the prob-lem of the prohibition of incest, already credited

 

difference only around a suture. As a result both the one and the other became all the more

 

enigmatic. And it would be risky to decide if the seam—the prohibition of incest—is a strange

 

exception that one happened to encounter within the

((104))

transparent system of difference, a “fact,” as Lévi-Strauss says, with which “we are then

 

confronted” (p. 9) [p. 8]; or is rather the origin of the dif

ference between nature and culture,

 

the condition—outside of the system —of the system of difference. The condition would be a

 

“scandal” only if one wished to comprehend it 

within 

the system whose condition it precisely

 

is.

Let us suppose then that everything universal in man relates to the natural order, and is

 

characterized by spontaneity, and that everything subject to a norm is cultural and is both

 

relative and particular. We are then confronted with a fact, or rather, a group of facts, which,

 

in the light of previous definitions, are not far removed from a scandal: . . . [for] the

 

prohibition of incest . . . presents, without the slightest ambiguity, and inseparably combines,

 

the two character

istics in which we recognize the conflicting features of two mutually

 

exclusive orders. It constitutes a rule, but a rule which, alone among all the social rules,

 

possesses at the same time a universal character (p. 9) [pp. 8-9].

But the “scandal” appeared only at a certain moment of the analysis; the moment when,

 

giving up a “real analysis” which will never reveal any difference between nature and culture,

 

one passed to an “ideal analysis” permitting the definition of “the double criterion of norm

 

and universal

ity.” It is thus from the confidence placed in the difference between the two

 

analyses that the scandal took its scandalous meaning. What did this confidence signify? It

 

appeared to itself as the scholar’s right to employ “methodological tools” whose “logical

 

value” is anticipated, and in a state of precipitation, with regard to the “object,” to “truth,”

 

etc., with regard, in other words, to what science works toward. These are the first words—or

 

nearly so—of 

Structures:

It is beginning to emerge that this distinction between the state of nature and the state of

 

society (today I would rather say state of nature and state of culture) while of no acceptable

 




historical significance, does contain a logic, fully justify-ing its use by modern sociology as a

 

methodological tool (p. i) [p. 3].

This is clear: in regard to the “chiefly methodological value” of the con

cepts of nature and

 

culture, there is no evolution and even less retraction from 

Structures 

to 

The Savage Mind.

 

Nor is there either evolution or re-traction with regard to this concept of methodogical tool;

 

Structures 

announces most precisely what, more than a decade later, will be said of

 

“bricolage,” 

of tools such as “means” “collected or retained on the principle that ‘they may

 

always come in handy.’ “ “Like 

‘bricolage’ 

on the technical plane, mythical reflection can

 

reach brilliant unforeseen results on the intellectual plane. Conversely, attention has often

 

been drawn to the mytho-poetical nature of 

‘bricolage’ “ 

(pp. 26 f.) [pp. 17-18]. To be sure, it

 

would still remain to be asked if the anthropologist considers himself

((105))

“

engineer” or 

“bricoleur.” Le cru et le cuit 

[Paris, 1964] is presented as “the myth of

 

mythology” (“Preface,” p. 2o). *

Nevertheless, the effacement of the frontier between nature and culture is not produced by the

 

same gesture from 

Structures 

to 

The Savage Mind. 

In the first case, it is rather a question of

 

respecting the originality of a scandalous suture. In the second case, of a reduction, however

 

careful it might be not to “dissolve” the specificity of what it analyzes:

... it would not be enough to reabsorb particular humanities into a general one. This first

 

enterprise opens the way for others which Rousseau [whose “usual acumen” Lévi-Strauss has

 

just praised] would not have been so ready to accept and which are incumbent on the exact

 

natural sciences: the reinte

gration of culture in nature and finally of life within the whole of

 

its physio

chemical conditions (p. 327) [p. 247].

At once conserving and annulling inherited conceptual oppositions, this thought, like

 

Saussure’s, stands on a borderline: sometimes within an un-criticized conceptuality,

 

sometimes putting a strain on the boundaries, and working toward deconstruction.

Finally, why Lévi-Strauss 

and 

Rousseau? The quotation above necessarily leads us to this

 

question. This conjunction must be justified gradually and intrinsically. But it is already

 

known that Lévi-Strauss not only feels him-self to be 

in agreement 

with Jean-Jacques, to be

 

his heir at heart and in what might be called theoretical affect. He also often presents himself

 

as Rousseau’s modern disciple; he reads Rousseau as the 

founder, 

not only the prophet, of

 

modern anthropology. A hundred texts glorifying Rousseau may be cited. Nevertheless, let us

 

recall, at the end of 

Totémisme au

jourd’hui, ** 

the chapter on “Totemism from Within:” “a . .

 

.. militant fervor for ethnography,” the “astonishing insight” of Rousseau who, “more prudent

 

. . . than Bergson” and “before even the ‘discovery’ of totemism “penetrate[d]” (p. 147) that

 

which opens the possibility of totemism in general, namely:

1.

Pity, 

that fundamental affection, as primitive as the love of self, which unites us to others

 

naturally: to other human beings, certainly, but also to all living beings.

2.The

metaphoric—because it belongs to the passions, says Rousseau—essence of

 

our 

language.

pretation is the Essay

[and not of needs], his first expressions were tropes. Figurative ‘ language was the first to be

 

bom” [p. 12]. It is again in “Totemism from Within” that the second 

Discourse is 

defined as

 

“the first treatise of general anthro

pology in French literature. In almost modem terms,

 

Rousseau poses the central problem of anthropology, viz., the passage from nature to culture”

 

(p. 142) [p. 99]. And here is the most systematic homage: “Rousseau did not merely foresee

 

anthropology; he founded it. First in a practical way, in writing that 

Discours sur l’origine et

 

les fondements de l’inégalité parmi les hommes 

which poses the problem of the relationships

 

between nature and culture, and which is the first treatise of general anthropology; and later

 

on the theoretical plane, by distinguishing, with admirable clarity and concision, the proper

 

object of the anthropologist from that of the moralist and the historian: ‘When one wants to

 

study men, one must con-sider those around one. But to study man, one must extend the range

 

of one’s vision. One must first observe the differences in order to discover the properties’

 

(Essay on the Origin of Languages, 

Chapter VIII) [pp. 30-31]

.”

It is therefore a declared and militant Rousseauism. Already it imposes on us a very general

 

question that will orient all our readings more or less directly: to what extent does Rousseau’s

 

appurtenance to logocentric meta-physics and within the philosophy of presence—an

 

appurtenance that we have already been able to recognize and whose exemplary figure we

 

must delineate—to what extent does it limit a scientific discourse? Does it neces

sarily retain

 

within its boundaries the Rousseauist discipline and fidelity of an anthropologist and of a

 

theorist of modern anthropology?

If this question is not sufficient to link the development which will follow with my initial

 

proposition, I should perhaps recapitulate:

1.that digression about the violence that 

does not supervene 

from with-out upon an innocent

 

language in order to surprise it, a language that suffers the aggression of writing as the

 

accident of its disease, its defeat and its fall; but is the originary violence of a language which

 

is always al-ready a writing. Rousseau and Lévi-Strauss are not for a moment to be

 

challenged when they relate the power of writing to the exercise of vio

lence. But radicalizing

 

this theme, no longer considering this violence as 

derivative 

with respect to a naturally

 

innocent speech, one reverses the en-tire sense of a proposition—the unity of violence and

 

writing—which one must therefore be careful not to abstract and isolate.




2.that other ellipsis of the metaphysics or onto-theology of the logos (par excellence in its

 

Hegelian moment) as the powerless and oneiric effort to master absence by reducing the

 

metaphor within the absolute parousia of sense. Ellipsis of the originary writing within

 

language as the irreducibility of metaphor, which it is necessary here to think in its possi

bility

 

and short of its rhetorical repetition. The irremediable absence of the

((107))

proper name. Rousseau no doubt believed in the figurative initiation of lan

guage, but he

 

believed no less, as we shall see, in a progress toward literal (proper) meaning. “Figurative

 

language was the first to be bom,” he says, only to add, “proper meaning was discovered last”

 

(Essay). 

5 It is to this eschatology of the 

proper (grope, proprius, 

self-proximity, self-

presence, property, own-ness) that we ask the question of the 

graphein.

Essay on the Origin of Lan

guages, 

from “A Writing

 

Lesson” given to the writing lesson refused by the person who was “ashamed to toy” with the

 

“trifl[ing]” matter of writing in a treatise on education. My question is perhaps better stated

 

thus: do they say the same thing? Do they do the same thing?

In that

the “Writing Lesson” marks an episode of

 

what may be called the anthro

pological war, the essential confrontation that opens

 

communication be

tween peoples and cultures, even when that communication is not prac

ticed

 

under the banner of colonial or missionary oppression. The entire “Writing Lesson” is

 

recounted in the tones of violence repressed or de

ferred, a violence sometimes veiled, but

 

always oppressive and heavy. Its weight is felt in various places and various moments of the

 

narrative: 

in Lévi-Strauss’s account as in the relationship among individuals and among

 

groups, among cultures or within the same community. ‘What can a rela

the violent spacing, of nature, of the natural, savage, salvage, forest. The 

silva is 

savage, the

 

via rupta is 

written, discerned, and inscribed violently as difference, as form imposed on the

 

hyle, 

in the forest, in wood as matter; it is difficult.to imagine that access to the possibility of a

 

road-map is not at the same time access to writing). The territory of the Nambikwara is

 

crossed by the line of an autochthonic picada. But also by another 

line, 

this time imported :

[An abandoned telephone line] obsolete from the day of its completion [which] hung down

 

from poles never replaced when they go to rot and tumble to the ground. (Sometimes the

 

termites attack them, and sometimes the Indians, who mistake the humming of the telegraph

 

wires for the noise of bees on their way to the hive.) [p. 262]

The Nambikwara, whose tormenting and cruelty—presumed or not—are much feared by the

 

personnel of the line, “brought the observer back to what he might readily, though mistakenly,

 

suppose to be the childhood of our race” [p. 265]. Lévi-Strauss describes the biological and

 

cultural type of this population whose technology, economy, institutions, and structures of

 

kinship, however primitive, give them of course a rightful place within humankind, so-called

 

human society and the “state of culture.” They speak and prohibit incest. “All were

 

interrelated, for the Nambikwara prefer to marry a niece (their sister’s daughter), or a

 

kinswoman of the kind which anthropologists call ‘cross-cousin’: the daughter of their

 

father’s sister, or of their mother’s brother” [p. 269]. Yet another reason for not allowing one-

self to be taken in by appearances and for not believing that one sees here the “childhood of

 

our race:” the structure of the language. And above all its 

usage. 

The Nambikwara use several

 

dialects and several systems accord-ing to situations. And here intervenes a phenomenon

 

which may be crudely called “linguistic” and which will be of central interest to us. It has to

 

do with 

a fact 

that we have not the means of interpreting beyond its general conditions of

 

possibility, its a priori; whose factual and empirical causes—as they open within this

 

determined situation—will escape us, and, more-over, call forth no question on the part of

 

Lévi-Strauss, who merely notes them. This fact bears on what we have proposed about the

 

essence or the energy of the 

graphein 

as the originary effacement of the proper name. From

 

the moment that the proper name is erased in a system, there is writing, there is a “subject”

 

from the moment that this obliteration of the proper is produced, that is to say from the first

 

appearing of the proper and from the first dawn of language. This proposition is universal in

 

essence and can be produced 

a priori. How 

one passes from this 

a priori 

to the determination

 

of empirical facts is a question that one cannot answer in general here. First because, by

 

definition, there is no general answer to a question of this form.

((109))

It is therefore such a 

fact 

that we encounter here. It does not involve the structural effacement

 

of what we believe to be our proper names; it does not involve the obliteration that,

 

paradoxically, constitutes the originary legibility of the very thing it erases, but of a

 




prohibition heavily superim

posed, in certain societies, upon the use of the proper name: “They

 

are not allowed . . . to use proper names” [p. 270], Lévi-Strauss observes.

Before we consider this, let us note that this prohibition is necessarily derivative with regard

 

to the constitutive erasure of the proper name in what I have called arche-writing, within, that

 

is, the play of difference. It is because the proper names are already no longer proper names,

 

because their production is their obliteration, because the erasure and the imposition of the

 

letter are originary, because they do not supervene upon a proper in

scription; it is because the

 

proper name has never been, as the unique appellation reserved for the presence of a unique

 

being, anything but the original myth of a transparent legibility present under the obliteration;

 

it is because the proper name was never possible except through its func

tioning within a

 

classification and therefore within a system of differences, within a writing retaining the

 

traces of difference, that the interdict was possible, could come into play, and, when the time

 

came, as we shall see, could be transgressed; transgressed, that is to say restored to the

 

oblitera

tion and the non-self-sameness 

[non-propriété] 

at the origin.

This is strictly in accord with one of Lévi-Strauss’s intentions. In “Uni

versalization and

 

Particularization” 

(The Savage Mind, 

Chapter VI) it will be demonstrated that “one ... never

 

names: one classes someone else .. . [or] one classes oneself.” 6 A demonstration anchored in

 

some examples of prohibitions that affect the use of proper names here and there. Un

-

doubtedly one should carefully distinguish between the essential necessity of the

 

disappearance of the proper name and the determined prohibition which can, contingently and

 

ulteriorly, be added to it or articulated within it. Nonprohibition, as much as prohibition,

 

presupposes fundamental ob

literation. Nonprohibition, the 

consciousness 

or exhibition of the

 

proper name, only makes up for or uncovers an essential and irremediable im-propriety.

 

‘When within 

consciousness, 

the name 

is called 

proper, it is already classified and is

 

obliterated in 

being named. 

It is already no more than 

a so-called 

proper name.

If writing is no longer understood in the narrow sense of linear and pho

netic notation, it

 

should be possible to say that all societies capable of producing, that is to say of obliterating,

 

their proper names, and of bringing classificatory difference into play, practice writing in

 

general. No reality or concept would therefore correspond to the expression “society without

 

writ-ing.” This expression is dependent on ethnocentric oneirism, upon the vulgar, that is to

 

say ethnocentric, misconception of writing. The scorn for writing, let us note in passing,

 

accords quite happily with this ethnocen-

((110))

trism. The paradox is only apparent, one of those contradictions where a perfectly coherent

 

desire is uttered and accomplished. By one and the same gesture, (alphabetic) writing, servile

 

instrument of a speech dreaming of its plenitude and its self-presence, is scorned and the

 

dignity of writing is refused to nonalphabetic signs. We have perceived this gesture in

 

Rousseau and in Saussure.

The Nambikwara—the 

subject 

of “A Writing Lesson”—would therefore be one of these

 

peoples without writing. They do not make use of what 

we 

commonly call writing. At least

 

that is what Lévi-Strauss tells us: “That the Nambikwara could not write goes without saying”

 

[p. 288]. This incapacity will be presently thought, within the ethico-political order, as an

 

innocence and a non-violence interrupted by the forced entry of the West and the “Writing

 

Lesson.” We shall be present at that scene in a little while.




How can access to writing in general be refused to the Nambikwara except by determining

 

writing according to a model? Later on we shall ask, confronting many passages in Lévi-

Strauss, up to what point it is legiti

mate not to call by the name of writing those “few dots”

 

and “zigzags” on their calabashes, so briefly evoked in 

Tristes Tropiques. 

But above all, how

 

can we deny the practice of writing in general to a society capable of obliterating the proper,

 

that is to say a violent society? For writing, ob

literation of the proper classed in the play of

 

difference, is the originary violence itself: pure impossibility of the “vocative mark,”

 

impossible purity of the mark of vocation. This “equivocation,” which Rousseau hoped would

 

be “eliminated” by a “vocative mark,” cannot be effaced. For the existence of such a mark in

 

any code of punctuation would not change the problem. The death of absolutely proper

 

naming, recognizing in a language the other as pure other, invoking it as what it is, is the

 

death of the pure idiom re-served for the unique. Anterior to the possibility of violence in the

 

current and derivative sense, the sense used in “A Writing Lesson,” there is, as the space of its

 

possibility, the violence of the arche-writing, the violence of difference, of classification, and

 

of the system of appellations. Before out-lining the structure of this implication, let us read the

 

scene of proper names; with another scene, that we shall shortly read, it is an indispensable

 

preparation for the “Writing Lesson.” This scene is separated from the “Writing Lesson” by

 

one chapter and another scene: “Family Life.” And it is described in Chapter 26 [23] “On the

 

Line.”

The Nambikwara make no difficulties and are quite indifferent to the presence of the

 

anthropologist with his notebooks and camera. But certain problems of language complicated

 

matters. They are not allowed, for instance, to use proper names. To tell one from another we

 

had to do as the men of the line do and agree with the Nambikwara on a set of nicknames

 

which would serve for identi

fication. Either Portuguese names, like Julio, Jose-Maria, Luisa;

 

or sobriquets such as 

Lebre, 

hare, or 

Assucar, 

sugar. I even knew one whom Rondon or one

((111))

of his companions had nicknamed Cavaignac on account of his little pointed beard—a rarity

 

among Indians, most of whom have no hair on their faces. One day, when I was playing with

 

a group of children, a little girl was struck by one of her comrades. She ran to me for

 

protection and began to whisper some-thing, a “great secret,” in my ear. As I did not

 

understand I had to ask her to repeat it over and over again. Eventually her adversary found

 

out what was going on, came up to me in a rage, and tried in her turn to tell me what seemed

 

to be another secret. After a little while I was able to get to the bottom of the incident. The

 

first little girl was trying to tell me her enemy’s name, and when the enemy found out what

 

was going on she decided to tell me the other girl’s name, by way of reprisal. Thenceforward

 

it was easy enough, though not very scrupulous, to egg the children on, one against the other,

 

till in time I knew all of their names. When this was completed and we were all, in a sense,

 

one another’s accomplices, I soon got them to give me the adults’ names too. When this

 

[cabal] was discovered the children were reprimanded and my sources of information dried

 

up. 7

We cannot enter here into the difficulties of an empirical deduction of this prohibition, but we

 

know a priori that the “proper names” whose interdiction and revelation Lévi-Strauss

 

describes here are not proper names. The expression “proper name” is improper, for the very

 

reasons that 

The Savage Mind 

will recall. What the interdict is laid upon is the uttering of

 

what 

functions 

as the proper name. And this function is 

consciousness 

it-self. The proper

 

name in the colloquial sense, in the sense of consciousness, is (I should say “in truth” were it

 




not necessary to be wary of that phrase) 8 only a designation of appurtenance and a

 

linguistico-social classification. The lifting of the interdict, the great game of denunciation

 

and the great exhibition of the “proper” (let us note that we speak here of an act of war and

 

there is much to say about the fact that it is little girls who open themselves to this game and

 

these hostilities) does not consist in revealing proper names, but in tearing the veil hiding a

 

classification and an appurtenance, the inscription within a system of linguistico-social

 

differences.

What the Nambikwara hid and the young girls lay bare through trans-gression, is no longer

 

the absolute idioms, but already varieties of invested common names, “abstracts” if, as we

 

read in 

The Savage Mind 

(p. 242) [p. 182], “systems of appellations also have their ‘abstracts.’

 

“

The concept of the proper name, unproblematized as Lévi-Strauss uses it in 

Tristes Tropiques,

 

is 

therefore far from being simple and manageable. Consequently, the same may be said of the

 

concepts of violence, ruse, perfidy, or oppression, that punctuate “A Writing Lesson” a little

 

further on. We have already noted that violence here does not unexpectedly break in all at

 

once, starting from an original innocence whose nakedness is 

surprised 

at the very moment

 

that the secret of the 

so-called 

proper names

((112))

is violated. The structure of violence is complex and its possibility

writing—no less so.

There was in fact a first violence to be named. To name, to give names that it will on occasion

 

be forbidden to pronounce, such is the originary violence of language which consists in

 

inscribing within a difference, in classifying, in suspending the vocative absolute. To think the

 

unique 

within 

the system, to inscribe it there, such is the gesture of the arche-writing: arche-

violence, loss of the proper, of absolute proximity, of self-presence, in truth the loss of what

 

has never taken place, of a self-presence which has never been given but only dreamed of and

 

always already split, re

peated, incapable of appearing to itself except in its own

 

disappearance. Out of this arche-violence, forbidden and therefore confirmed by a second

 

violence that is reparatory, protective, instituting the “moral,” prescribing the concealment of

 

writing and the effacement and obliteration of the so-called proper name which was already

 

dividing the proper, a third vio

lence can 

possibly 

emerge or not (an empirical possibility)

 

within what is commonly called evil, war, indiscretion, rape; which consists of revealing by

 

effraction the so-called proper name, the originary violence which has severed the proper

 

from its property and its self-sameness 

[proprété]. 

We could name a third violence of

 

reflection, which denudes the native non-identity, classification as denaturation of the proper,

 

and identity as the abstract moment of the concept. It is on this tertiary level, that of the em

-

pirical consciousness, that the common concept of violence (the system of the moral law and

 

of transgression) whose possibility remains yet un-thought, should no doubt be situated. The

 

scene of proper names is written on this level; as will be later the writing lesson.

This last violence is all the more complex in its structure because it refers at the same time to

 

the two inferior levels of arche-violence and of law. In effect, it reveals the first nomination

 

which was already an ex

propriation, but it denudes also that which since then functioned as

 

the proper, the so-called proper, substitute of the deferred proper, 

perceived 

by the 

social 

and

 

moral consciousness 

as the proper, the reassuring seal of self-identity, the secret.




Empirical violence, war in the colloquial sense (ruse and perfidy of little girls, 

apparent 

ruse

 

and perfidy of little girls, for the anthropologist will prove them innocent by showing himself

 

as the true and only culprit; ruse and perfidy of the Indian chief playing at the comedy of

 

writing, 

apparent 

ruse and perfidy of the Indian chief borrowing all his resources from the

 

Occidental intrusion), which Lévi-Strauss always thinks of as an 

accident. 

An accident

 

occurring, in his view, upon a terrain of innocence, in a “state of culture” whose 

natural

 

goodness had not yet been degraded. 9

Two pointers, seemingly anecdotal and belonging to the decor of the rep

resentation to come,

 

support this hypothesis that the “Writing Lesson” will

((113))

confirm. They announce the great staging of the “lesson” and show to advantage the art of the

 

composition of this travelogue. In accordance with eighteenth-century tradition, the anecdote,

 

the page of confessions, the fragment from a journal are knowledgeably put in place,

 

calculated for the purposes of a philosophical demonstration of the relationships between

 

nature and society, ideal society and real society, most often between the 

other 

society and our

 

society.

What is the first pointer? The battle of proper names follows the arrival of the foreigner and

 

that is not surprising. It is born in the presence and even from the presence of the

 

anthropologist who comes to disturb order and natural peace, the complicity which peacefully

 

binds the good society to itself in its play. Not only have the people of the Line imposed

 

ridiculous sobriquets on the natives, obliging them to assume these intrinsically (hare, sugar,

 

Cavaignac), but it is the anthropological eruption which breaks the secret of the proper names

 

and the innocent complicity governing the play of young girls. It is the anthropologist who

 

violates a virginal space so accurately connoted by the scene of a game and a game played by

 

little girls. The mere presence of the foreigner, the mere fact of his having his eyes open,

 

cannot not provoke a violation: the 

aside, 

the secret murmured in the ear, the successive

 

movements of the “stratagem,” the acceleration, the precipitation, a certain increasing

 

jubilation in the movement before the falling back which follows the consummated fault,

 

when the “sources” have “dried up,” makes us think of a dance and a fête as much as of war.

The mere presence of a spectator, then, is a violation. First a pure vio

lation: a silent and

 

immobile foreigner attends a game of young girls. That one of them should have “struck” a

 

“comrade” is not yet true violence. No integrity has been breached. Violence appears only at

 

the moment when the intimacy of proper names can be opened to forced entry. And that is

 

possible only at the moment when the space is shaped and reoriented by the glance of the

 

foreigner. The eye of the other calls out the proper names, spells them out, and removes the

 

prohibition that covered them.

At first the anthropologist is satisfied merely to see. A fixed glance and a mute presence. Then

 

things get complicated, become more tortuous and labyrinthine, when he becomes a party to

 

the play of the rupture of play, as he lends an ear and broaches a first complicity with the

 

victim who is also the trickster. Finally, for what counts is the names of the adults (one could

 

say the eponyms and the secret is violated only in the place where the names are attributed),

 

the ultimate denunciation can no longer do with-out the active intervention of the foreigner.

 

Who, moreover, claims to have intervened and accuses himself of it. He has seen, then heard;

 

but, passive in the face of what he already knew he was provoking, he still waited to hear the

 




master-names. The violation was not consummated, the naked base of the proper was still

 

reserved. As one cannot or rather must not in-

((114))

criminate the innocent young girls, the violation will be accomplished by the thenceforward

 

active, perfidious, and rusing intrusion of the foreigner who, having seen and heard, is now

 

going to “excite” the young girls, loosen their tongues, and get them to divulge the precious

 

names: those of the adults (the dissertation tells us that only “the adults possessed names that

 

were proper to them,” p. 39). With a bad conscience, to be sure, and with that pity which

 

Rousseau said unites us with the most foreign of foreigners. Let us now reread the 

mea culpa,

 

the confession of the anthropologist who assumes entire responsibility for a violation that has

 

satisfied him. After 

giving 

one another 

away, 

the young girls 

gave away 

the adults.

The first little girl was trying to tell me her enemy’s name, and when the enemy found out

 

what was going on she decided to tell me the other girl’s name, by way of reprisal.

 

Thenceforward it was easy enough, though not very scrupulous, to egg the children on, one

 

against the other, till in time I knew all their names. When this was completed and we were

 

all, in a sense, one another’s accomplices, I soon got them to give me the adults’ names too [p.

 

2701.

The true culprit will not be punished, and this gives to his fault the stamp of the irremediable:

 

“When this [cabal] was discovered the children were reprimanded and my sources of

 

information dried up.”

One already suspects—and all Lévi-Strauss’s writings would confirm it—that the critique of

 

ethnocentrism, a theme so dear to the author of 

Tristes Tropiques, 

has most often the sole

 

function of constituting the other as a model of original and natural goodness, of accusing and

 

humiliating one-self, of exhibiting its being-unacceptable in an anti-ethnocentric mirror.

 

Rousseau would have taught the modern anthropologist this humility of one who knows he is

 

“unacceptable,” this remorse that produces anthropology. 10 That is at least what we are told

 

in the Geneva lecture:

In truth, I am not “I,” but the feeblest and humblest of “others.” Such is the discovery of the

 

Confessions. 

Does the anthropologist write anything other than confessions? First in his own

 

name, as I have shown, since it is the moving force of his vocation and his work; and in that

 

very work, in the name of the society, which, through the activities of its emissary, the

 

anthropologist, chooses for itself other societies, other civilizations, and precisely the weakest

 

and most humble; but only to verify to what extent that first society is itself “unaccept

able”

 

(p.z45)•

Without speaking of the point of mastery thus gained by the person who conducts this

 

operation at home, one rediscovers here a gesture inherited from the eighteenth century, from

 

a certain eighteenth century at any rate, for even in that century a certain sporadic suspicion of

 

such an exercise had already commenced. Non-European peoples were not only studied as the

((115))

index to a hidden good Nature, as a native soil recovered, of a “zero degree” with reference to

 

which one could outline the structure, the growth, and above all the degradation of our society

 




and our culture. As always, this archeology is also a teleology and an eschatology; the dream

 

of a full and immediate presence closing history, the transparence and indivision of a

 

parousia, the suppression of contradiction and difference. The anthro

pologist’s mission, as

 

Rousseau would have assigned it, is to work toward such an end. Possibly against the

 

philosophy which “alone” would have sought to “excite” “antagonisms” between the “self

 

and the other.” 11 Let us not be accused here of forcing words and things. Let us rather read.

 

It is again the Geneva lecture, but a hundred similar passages may be found:

The Rousseauist revolution, pre-forming and initiating the anthropological revo

lution,

 

consists in refusing the expected identifications, whether that of a culture with that culture, or

 

that of an individual, member of one culture, with a per

sonage or a social function that the

 

same culture wishes to impose upon him. In both cases the culture or the individual insists on

 

the right to a free identi

fication which can only be realized 

beyond 

man: an identification with

 

all that lives and therefore suffers; and an identification which can also be realized 

short 

of

 

the function or the person; with a yet unfashioned, but given, being. Then the self and the

 

other, freed of an antagonism that only philosophy seeks to excite, recover their unity. An

 

original alliance, at last renewed, permits them to found together the 

we 

against the 

him,

 

against a society inimical to man, and which man finds himself all the more ready to

 

challenge because Rousseau, by his example, teaches him how to elude the intolerable

 

contradictions of civilized life. For if it is true that Nature has expelled man, and that society

 

persists in oppressing him, man can at least reverse the horns of the dilemma to his own

 

advantage, 

and seek out the society 

of 

nature in order to meditate there upon the nature 

of

 

society. 

This, it seems to me, is the indissoluble message of 

The Social Contract, 

the 

Lettres

 

sur la botanique, 

and the 

Reveries. 

12

“

A Little Glass of Rum,” which is a severe criticism of Diderot and a glorification of

 

Rousseau (“[who] of all the 

philosophes, 

came nearest to being an anthropologist . . . our

 

master . . . our brother, great as has been our ingratitude toward him; and every page of this

 

book could have been dedicated to him, had the object thus proffered not been unworthy of

 

his great memory”) concludes thus: “. . . the question to be solved is whether or not these evils

 

are themselves inherent in that state [of society]. We must go beyond the evidence of the

 

injustices or abuses to which the social order gives rise and discover the unshakeable basis of

 

human society.” 13

The diversified thinking of Lévi-Strauss would be impoverished if it were not emphatically

 

recalled here that this goal and this motivation do not exhaust, though they do more than

 

connote, the task of science. They

((116))

mark it profoundly in its very content. I had promised a second pointer. The Nambikwara,

 

around whom the “Writing Lesson” will unfold its scene, among whom evil will insinuate

 

itself with the intrusion of writing come from 

without (exothen, 

as the 

Phaedrus 

says) —the

 

Nambikwara, who do not know how to write, are 

good, we 

are told. The Jesuits, the Protestant

 

missionaries, the American anthropologists, the technicians on the Line, who believed they

 

perceived violence or hatred among the Nambikwara are not only mistaken, they have

 

probably projected their own wickedness upon them. And even provoked the evil that they

 

then believed they saw or wished to perceive. Let us reread the end of Chapter 17 [24],

 

entitled, al-ways with the same skill, “Family Life.” This passage immediately precedes “A

 

Writing Lesson” and is, in a certain way, indespensable to it. Let us first confirm what goes

 




without saying: if we subscribe to Lévi-Strauss’s declara

tions about their innocence and

 

goodness, their “great sweetness of nature,” “the most . . . authentic manifestations of human

 

tenderness,” etc. only by assigning them a totally derived, relative, and empirical place of

 

legitimacy, regarding them as descriptions of the empirical affections of the 

subject 

of this

 

chapter—the Nambikwara as well as the author—if then we subscribe to these descriptions

 

only as 

empirical relation, 

it does not follow that we give credence to the moralizing

 

descriptions of the American anthropolo

gist’s converse deploring of the hatred, surliness, and

 

lack of civility of the natives. In fact these two accounts are symmetrically opposed, they have

 

the same dimensions, and arrange themselves around one and the same axis. After having

 

cited a foreign colleague’s publication, which is very severe toward the Nambikwara for their

 

complacency in the face of disease, their filthiness, wretchedness, and rudeness, their

 

rancorous and distrustful character, Lévi-Strauss argues:

When I myself had known them, the diseases introduced by white men had already decimated

 

them; but there had not been, since Rondon’s always hu-mane endeavors, any attempt to

 

enforce their submission. I should prefer to forget Mr. Oberg’s harrowing description and

 

remember the Nambikwara as they appear in a page from my notebooks. I wrote it one night

 

by the light of my pocket-lamp: “The camp-fires shine out in the darkened savannah. Around

 

the hearth which is their only protection from the cold, behind the flimsy screen of foliage and

 

palm-leaves which had been stuck into the ground where it will best break the force of wind

 

and rain, beside the baskets filled with the pitiable objects which comprise all their earthly

 

belongings, the Nam

bikwara lie on the bare earth. Always they are haunted by the thought of

 

other groups, as fearful and hostile as they are themselves, and when they lie entwined

 

together, couple by couple, each looks to his mate for support and comfort and finds in the

 

other a bulwark, the only one he knows, against the difficulties of every day and the

 

meditative melancholia which from time to time overwhelms the Nambikwara. The visitor

 

who camps among the Indians for the first time cannot but feel anguish and pity at the sight of

 

a people so totally dis-provided

((117))

for; beaten down into the hostile earth, it would seem, by an implacable cataclysm; naked and

 

shivering beside their guttering fires. He gropes his way among the bushes, avoiding where he

 

can the hand, or the arm, or the torso that lies gleaming in the firelight. But this misery is

 

enlivened by laughing whispers. Their embraces are those of couples possessed by a longing

 

for a lost oneness; Their_caresses are in no wise disturbed by the footfall of a stranger. In one

 

and all there may be glimpsed a great sweetness of nature, a profound nonchalance, an animal

 

satisfaction as ingenuous as it is charming, and, beneath all this, something that can be

 

recognized as one of the most moving and authentic manifestations of human tenderness” [p.

 

285].

The “Writing Lesson” follows this description, which one may indeed read for what it claims,

 

at the outset, to be: a page “from my notebooks” scribbled one night in the light of a pocket

 

lamp. It would be different if this moving painting were to belong to an anthropological

 

discourse. How-ever, it certainly sets up a premise—the goodness or innocence of the

 

Nambikwara—indispensable to the subsequent demonstration of the con-joint intrusion of

 

violence and writing. Here a strict separation of the anthropological confession and the

 

theoretical discussion of the anthro

pologist must be observed. The difference between

 

empirical and essential must continue to assert its rights.




We know that Lévi-Strauss has very harsh words for the philosophies that have made the

 

mind aware of this distinction, and which are, for the most part, philosophies of

 

consciousness, of the cogito in the Cartesian or Hus

serlian sense. Very harsh words also for

 

L’Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience, * 

which Lévi-Strauss reproaches his old

 

teachers for having pondered too much instead of studying Saussure’s 

Course in General

 

Linguistics. 14

 Now whatever one may finally think of philosophies thus incriminated or

 

ridiculed (and of which I shall say nothing here except to note that only their ghosts, which

 

sometimes haunt school manuals, selected extracts, or popular opinion, are evoked here), it

 

should be recog

nized that the difference between empirical affect and the structure of essence

 

was for them a major rule. Neither Descartes nor Husserl would ever have suggested that they

 

considered an empirical modification of their relationship with the world or with others as

 

scientific truth, nor the quality of an emotion as the premise of a syllogism. Never in the

 

Regulae 

does one pass from the phenomenologically irrefutable truth of “I see yellow” to the

 

judgment “the world is yellow.” Let us not pursue this direction. Never, at any rate, would a

 

rigorous philosopher of consciousness have been so quickly persuaded of the fundamental

 

goodness and virginal innocence of the Nambikwara merely on the strength of an empirical

 

ac-count. From the point of view of anthropological science, this conclusion is

((118))

as surprising as the wicked American anthropologist’s might be “distress-ing” (Lévi-Strauss’s

 

word). Surprising, indeed, that this unconditional affirmation of the radical goodness of the

 

Nambikwara comes from the pen of an anthropologist who sets against the bloodless

 

phantoms of the philosophers of consciousness and intuition, those who have been, if the

 

beginning of 

Tristes Tropiques is 

to be believed, his only true masters: Marx and Freud.

The thinkers assembled hastily at the beginning of that book under the banner of metaphysics,

 

phenomenology, and existentialism, would not be recognized in the lineaments ascribed to

 

them. But it would be wrong to conclude that, conversely, Marx and Freud would have been

 

satisfied by the theses written in their name—and notably the chapters that interest us. They

 

generally demanded to see proof when one spoke of “great sweetness of nature,” “profound

 

nonchalance,” “animal satisfac

tion as ingenuous as it is charming,” and “something that can

 

be recog

nized as one of the most moving and authentic manifestations of human tenderness.”

 

They wanted to see proof and would undoubtedly not have understood what could possibly be

 

referred to as “the original alliance, later renewed,” permitting “the found[ing] together of the

 

we 

against the 

him” 

(already quoted), or as “that regular and, as it were crystalline struc

ture

 

which the best-preserved of primitive societies teach us is not antago

nistic to the human

 

condition” 

(Leçon inaugurale au College de France,

P. 49) *

Within this entire system of philosophical kinship and claims of genealogical filiations, not

 

the least surprised might well be Rousseau. Had he not asked that he be allowed to live in

 

peace with the philosophers of consciousness and of interior sentiment, in peace with that

 

sensible cogito, 15 with that interior voice which, he believed, never lied? To recon

cile

 




Rousseau, Marx, and Freud is a difficult task. Is it possible to make them agree among

 

themselves in the systematic rigor of conceptuality?

Dialogues

Let us finally open “A Writing Lesson.” If I give so much attention to the chapter, it is not in

 

order to take unfair advantage of a travel journal,

((119))

something that could be considered the least scientific expression of a thought. On the one

 

hand, all the themes of the systematic theory of writing presented for the first time in 

Tristes

 

Tropiques 

may be found in other writings, 16 in another form and more or less dispersed. On

 

the other hand, the theoretical content is itself expounded at length in this work, at greater

 

length than anywhere else, by way of comment on an “extraordi

nary incident.” This incident

 

is also reported in the same terms at the beginning of the dissertation on the Nambikwara,

 

seven years earlier than 

Tristes Tropiques. 

Finally, it is only in 

Tristes Tropiques 

that the sys

-

tem is articulated in the most rigorous and complete way. The indispensable premises, namely

 

the nature of. the organism submitted to the aggression of writing, are nowhere more explicit.

 

That is why I have followed the description of the innocence of the Nambikwara at length.

 

Only an inno

cent community, and a community of reduced dimensions (a Rousseauist theme

 

that will soon become clearer), only a micro-society of non-violence and freedom, all the

 

members of which can by rights remain within range of an immediate and .transparent, a

 

“crystalline” address, fully self-present in its living speech, only such a community can suffer,

 

as the surprise of an aggression coming 

from without, 

the insinuation of writing, the infiltra

-

tion of its “ruse” and of its “perfidy.” Only such a community can import 

from abroad 

“the

 

exploitation of man by man.” “The Lesson” is therefore complete; in subsequent texts, the

 

theoretical conclusions of the incident will be presented without the concrete premises,

 

original innocence will be 

implied but not expounded. 

In the previous text, the dissertation on

 

the Nambikwara, the incident is reported but it does not lead, as in 

Tristes Tropiques, 

to a long

 

meditation on the historical meaning, origin, and function of the written. On the other hand, I

 

shall draw from the disserta

tion information that will be valuable as annotations to 

Tristes

 

Tropiques.

Writing, the exploitation of man by man: I do not impose these words upon Lévi-Strauss. Let

 

us recall the 

Conversations 

by way of precaution: “... writing itself, in that first instance,

 

seemed to be associated in any permanent way only with societies which were based on the

 




exploitation of man by man” (p. 36) [p. 3o]. In 

Tristes Tropiques, 

Lévi-Strauss is aware of

 

proposing a Marxist theory of writing. He says it in a letter of 1955 (the year the book

 

appeared) to the 

Nouvelle critique. 

Criticized by M. Rodinson in the name of Marxism, he

 

complains:

If he [M. Rodinson] had read my book, instead of confining himself to the extracts published

 

a few months ago, he would have discovered—in addition to a Marxist hypothesis on the

 

origins of writing—two studies dedicated to Bra

zilian tribes (the Caduveo and the Bororo),

 

which are efforts to interpret native superstructures based upon dialectical materialism. The

 

novelty of this approach in the Western anthropological literature perhaps deserves more

 

attention and sympathy. 17

((120))

Our question is therefore no longer only “how to reconcile Rousseau and Marx” but also: “Is

 

it sufficient to speak of superstructure and to denounce in an hypothesis an exploitation of

 

man by man in order to confer a Marxian pertinence upon this hypothesis?” A question that

 

has meaning only through implying an original rigor in Marxist criticism and distinguish it

 

from all other criticism of suffering, of violence, of exploitation, etc.; for example, from

 

Buddhist criticism. Our question has clearly no meaning at the point where one can say

 

“between Marxist criticism . . . and Buddhist criticism . . . there is neither opposition nor

 

contradiction.” 18

Another precaution is necessary before the “Lesson.” I have earlier emphasized the ambiguity

 

of the ideology which governs the Saussurian exclusion of writing: a profound ethnocentrism

 

privileging the model of phonetic writing, a model that makes the exclusion of the 

graphie

 

easier and more legitimate. It is, however, an ethnocentrism 

thinking itself 

as anti-

ethnocentrism, an ethnocentrism in the consciousness of a liberating pro

gressivism. By

 

radically separating language from writing, by placing the latter below and outside, believing

 

at least that it is possible to do so, by giving oneself the illusion of liberating linguistics from

 

all involvement with written evidence, one thinks in fact to restore the status of authentic lan

-

guage, human and fully signifying language, to all languages practiced by 

peoples whom one

 

nevertheless continues to describe as “without writing.” 

It is not fortuitous that the same

 

ambiguity affects Lévi-Strauss’s intentions.

On the one hand, 

the colloquial difference between language and writing, the rigorous

 

exteriority of one with respect to the other, is admitted. This permits the distinction between

 

peoples using writing and peoples without writing. Lévi-Strauss is never suspicious of the

 

value of such a distinction. This above all allows him to consider the passage from speech to

 

writing as a 

leap, 

as the instantaneous crossing of a line of discontinuity: passage from a fully

 

oral language, pure of all 

writing—pure, 

innocent—to a language appending to itself its

 

graphic “representation” as an accessory signifier of a new type, opening a technique of

 

oppression. Lévi-Strauss needed this “epigenetist” concept of writing in order that the theme

 

of evil and of exploitation suddenly coming about with the 

graphie 

could indeed be the theme

 

of a surprise and an accident affecting the purity of an innocent language from without.

 

Affecting it 

as if by chance. 

19 At any rate the epigenetist thesis repeats, in connection with

 

writing this time, an affirmation that we could have encountered five years previously in the

 

Introduction à l’oeuvre de Marcel Mauss 

(p. 

47) : 

“Language could only have been born

 

suddenly.” We might well find numerous questions to raise about this paragraph, which ties

 




sense to signification and more narrowly to linguistic signification in the 

spoken 

language. Let

 

us simply read these few lines:

((121))

Whatever might have been the moment and the circumstances of its appearance on the scale

 

of animal life, language could only have been born suddenly. Things could not have begun to

 

signify progressively. Following a transforma

tion whose study does not belong to the social

 

sciences, but to biology and psychology, a passage was effected from a stage where nothing

 

had sense to another where everything did.

(That biology and psychology could account for this rupture would seem to us more than

 

problematic. There follows a fertile distinction between 

signifying 

discourse and 

knowing

 

discourse, which, some fifty years previ

ously, a philosopher of consciousness, more neglected

 

than others, had articulated rigorously in logical investigations.) *

This epigenetism is, nevertheless, not the most Rousseauist aspect of a thought which so often

 

gives as its authority the Essay 

on the Origin of Languages 

and the second Discourse—where

 

however it is also a question of “the infinite space of time that the first invention of languages

 

must have cost” [p. 189].

The traditional and fundamental ethnocentrism which, inspired by the model of phonetic

 

writing, separates writing from speech with an ax, is thus handled and thought of as anti-

ethnocentrism. It supports an ethico-politi

cal accusation: man’s exploitation by man is the fact

 

of writing cultures of the Western type. Communities of innocent and unoppressive speech are

 

free from this accusation.

On the other hand—it 

is the other side of the same gesture—if Lévi-Strauss constantly

 

recognizes the pertinence of the division between peoples with and peoples without writing,

 

this division is effaced by him from the moment that one might ethnocentrically wish to make

 

it play a role in the reflection on history and on the respective value of cultures. The

 

difference between peoples with and peoples without writing is accepted, but writing as the

 

criterion of historicity or cultural value is not taken into account; ethnocentrism will

 

apparently be avoided at the very moment when it will have already profoundly operated,

 

silently imposing its standard concepts of speech and writing. This was exactly the pattern of

 

the Saussurian gesture. In other words, all the liberating criticisms and legitimate

 

denunciations with which Lévi-Strauss has harried the pre-supposed distinctions between

 

historical societies and societies without his-tory, remain dependent on the concept of writing

 

I problematize here.

What is the “Writing Lesson?”

Lesson in a double sense. The title effectively preserves both senses. Writing lesson since it is

 

a question of the learning of writing. The Nambikwara chief learns writing from the

 

anthropologist, at first without

comprehension, he mimics writing before he understands its function as language; or rather he

 

understands its profoundly enslaving function before understanding its function, here

 

accessory, of communication, signification, of the tradition of a signified. But the writing

 

lesson is also a lesson learned from writing; instruction that the anthropologist believes he can

 

induce from the incident in the course of a long meditation, when, fighting against insomnia,

 

he reflects on the origin, function, and meaning of writing. Hav-ing taught the gesture of

 

writing to a Nambikwara chief who learned with-out comprehension, the anthropologist

 

understands what he has taught and induces the lesson of writing.

Thus, two moments:

A.The empirical relation of a perception: the scene of the “extraordi

nary incident.”

B.After the vicissitudes of .the day, sleepless in the watches of the night, a historico-

philosophical reflection on the scene of writing and the profound meaning of the incident, of

 

the closed history of writing.

A. 

The extraordinary incident. 

From the very first lines, the decor reminds us of that

 

anthropological violence of which I spoke above. The two parts are well engaged here, and

 

that restores the true meaning of the remarks on “a great sweetness of nature,” “an animal

 

satisfaction as in

genuous as it is charming,” the “profound nonchalance,” “the most moving

 

and authentic manifestations of human tenderness.” For example:

... their more than dubious welcome combined with their leader’s extreme nervousness

 

seemed to suggest that he had forced their hand, somewhat, in the whole matter. Neither we

 

nor the Indians felt at all at our ease, the night promised to be cold, and, as there were no

 

trees, we had to lie, like the Nam

bikwara, on the bare ground. No one slept: we kept, all night

 

long, a polite watch upon one another. It would have been rash to prolong the adventure, and I

 

suggested to the leader that we should get down to our exchanges without further delay. It was

 

then that there occurred an extraordinary incident which forces me to go back a little in time.

 

That the Nambikwara could not write goes without saying. But they were also unable to draw,

 

except for a few dots and zigzags on their calabashes. I distributed pencils and paper among

 

them, none the less, as I had done with the Caduveo. At first they made no use of them. Then,

 

one day, I saw that they were all busy drawing wavy horizontal lines on the paper. What were

 

they trying to do? I could only conclude that they were writing—or, more exactly, they were

 

trying to do as I did with my pencils. As I had never tried to amuse them with drawings, they

 

could not conceive of any other use for this implement. With most of them, that was as far as

 

they got: but their leader saw further into the problem. Doubtless he was the only one among

 

them to have understood what writing was for [p. z88].

Let us mark a first pause here. Among many others, this fragment comes superimposed upon a

 

passage from the thesis on the Nambikwara. The

((123))




incident was already related there and it may be useful to refer to it. Three specific points

 

omitted from 

Tristes Tropiques 

can be found in the thesis. They are not without interest.

1. This small group of Nambikwara 

20

 nevertheless uses a word to desig

nate the act of

 

writing, at least a word that may serve that end. There is no linguistic surprise in the face of

 

the supposed irruption of a new power. This detail, omitted from 

Tristes Tropiques, 

was

 

indicated in the thesis:

The Nambikwara of group (a) do not know anything about design, if one excepts some

 

geometric sketches on their calabashes. For many days, they did not know what to do with the

 

paper and the pencils that we distributed to them. Some time later, we saw them very busily

 

drawing wavy lines. In that they imitated the only use that they had seen us make of our

 

notebooks, namely writing, but without understanding its meaning or its end. They called the

 

act of writing iekariukedjutu, namely: “drawing lines.”

It is quite evident that a literal translation of the words that mean “to write” in the languages

 

of peoples with writing would also reduce that word to a rather poor gestural signification. It

 

is as if one said that such a language has no word designating writing—and that therefore

 

those who practice it do not know how to write—just because they use a word meaning “to

 

scratch,” “to engrave,” “to scribble,” “to scrape,” “to incise,” “to trace,” “to imprint,” etc. As

 

if “to write” in its metaphoric kernel, meant something else. Is not ethnocentrism always

 

betrayed by the haste with which it is satisfied by certain translations or certain domestic

 

equivalents? To say that a people do not know how to write because one can translate the

 

word which they use to designate the act’of inscribing as “drawing lines,” is that not as if one

 

should refuse them “speech” by translating the equivalent word by “to cry,” “to sing,” “to

 

sigh?” Indeed “to stammer.” By way of simple analogy with respect to the mechanisms of

 

ethnocentric assimilation/exclusion, let us recall with Renan that, “in the most ancient

 

languages, the words used to designate foreign peoples are drawn from two sources: either

 

words that signify ‘to stammer,’ ‘to mumble,’ or words that signify ‘mute.’ “ 21 And ought

 

one to conclude that the Chinese are a people without writing because the word 

wen

 

designates many things besides writing in the narrow sense? As in fact J. Geniet notes:

The word 

wen 

signifies a conglomeration of marks, the simple symbol in writing. It applies to

 

the veins in stones and wood, to constellations, represented by the strokes connecting the

 

stars, to the tracks of birds and quadrupeds on the ground (Chinese tradition would have it

 

that the observation of these tracks suggested the invention of writing), to tattoo and even, for

 

example, to the designs that decorate the turtle’s shell (“The turtle is wise,” an ancient text

 

says—gifted with magico-religious powers—“for it carries designs on its back”). The term

 

wen 

has designated, by extension, literature and social courtesy. Its

((124))

antonyms are the words wu (warrior, military) and 

zhi 

(brute matter not yet polished or

 

ornamented). 22

2.In this operation, which consists of “drawing lines” and which is thus incorporated into the

 

dialect of this subgroup, Lévi-Strauss finds an ex

clusively “aesthetic” signification: “They

 

called the act of writing iekariukedjutu, namely ‘drawing lines,’ which had an aesthetic

 

interest for them.” One wonders what the import of such a conclusion could be and what the

 

specificity of the aesthetic category could signify here. Lévi-Strauss seems not only to

 




presume that one can isolate aesthetic value (which is clearly most problematic, and in fact it

 

is the anthropologists more than anyone else who have put us on guard against this

 

abstraction), but also to suppose that in writing “properly speaking,” to which the

 

Nambikwara would not have access, the aesthetic quality is extrinsic. Let us merely men

tion

 

this problem. Moreover, even if one did not wish to treat the meaning of such a conclusion

 

with suspicion, one could still be troubled by the paths that lead to it. The anthropologist has

 

arrived at this conclusion through a sentence noted in 

another 

subgroup: “Kihikagnere

 

mu~iene” ((NB! ordet foran inneholder et spesialtegn som likner en speilvendt S.)) translated

 

by “drawing lines, that’s pretty.” To conclude from this proposi

tion thus translated and

 

recorded within another group (bl), that drawing lines held for group (al) an “aesthetic

 

interest,” which implies 

only 

an aesthetic interest, is what poses problems of logic that once

 

again we are content simply to mention.

3.When, in 

Tristes Tropiques, 

Lévi-Strauss remarks that “the Nambik

wara could not write . . .

 

they were also unable to draw, except for a few dots and zigzags on their calabashes,”

 

because, helped by instruments fur

nished by them, they trace only “wavy horizontal lines”

 

and that “with most of them, that was as far as they got,” these notations are brief. Not only

 

are they not to be found in the thesis, but, in fact, eighty pages further on (p. 123), the thesis

 

presents the results at which certain Nambikwara very quickly arrived and which Lévi-Strauss

 

treats as “a cultural innovation inspired by our own designs.” It is not merely a question of

 

representational designs (cf. Figure 19, p. 123) showing a man or a monkey, but of diagrams

 

describing, explaining, writing, a genealogy and a social structure. And that is a decisive

 

phenomenon. It is now known, thanks to unquestionable and abundant information, that the

 

birth of writing (in the colloquial sense) was nearly everywhere and most often linked to

 

genealogical anxiety. The memory and oral tradition of generations, which sometimes goes

 

back very far with peoples supposedly “without writing,” are often cited in this con

nection.

 

Lévi-Strauss himself does it in the 

Conversations 

(p. 

29) 

[p. 26]:

I know, of course, that the societies we call primitive often have a quite stag-gering capacity

 

for remembering, and we have been told about Polynesian

((125))

communities who can recite straight off family trees involving dozens of gen

erations; but that

 

kind of feat obviously has its limits.

Now it is this limit which is crossed more or less everywhere when writing—in the colloquial

 

sense—appears. Here its function is to conserve and give to a genealogical classification, with

 

all that that might imply, a supplementary objectification of another order. So that a people

 

who accede to the genealogical pattern accede also to writing in the colloquial sense,

 

understand its function and go much farther than 

Tristes Tropiques 

gives it to be understood

 

(“that was as far as they got”). Here one passes from arche-writing to writing in the colloquial

 

sense. This passage, whose difficulty I do not wish to underestimate, is not a passage from

 

speech to writing, it operates within writing in general. The genealogical relation and social

 

classification are the stitched seam of arche-writing, condition of the (so-called oral)

 

language, and of writing in the colloquial sense.

“

But their leader saw further into the problem.” The dissertation tells us that this leader is

 

“remarkably intelligent, aware of his responsibilities, active, enterprising, and ingenious.” “He

 

was a man of about thirty-five, married to three women.” “His attitude to writing is most

 




revealing. He immediately understood its role as sign, and the social superiority that it

 

confers.” Lévi-Strauss follows up with an account which is reproduced in nearly the same

 

terms in 

Tristes Tropiques:

Doubtless he was the only one among them who understood what writing was for. So he

 

asked me for one of my note pads and thus we were similarly equipped when we were

 

working together; he did not give me his answers in words, but traced a wavy line or two on

 

the paper and gave it to me, as if I could read what he had to say. He himself was all but

 

deceived by his own play-acting. Each time he drew a line he examined it with great care, as

 

if its meaning must suddenly leap to the eye; and every time a look of disappointment came

 

over his face. But he would never give up trying, and there was an unspoken agree-ment

 

between us that his scribblings had a meaning that I pretended to decipher; his own verbal

 

commentary was so prompt in coming that I had no need to ask him to explain what he had

 

written [pp. 288-89].

What immediately follows this passage corresponds to a passage in the thesis which comes

 

more than forty pages (p. 89) after the above and concerns the function of the commandment,

 

a significant fact to which I shall return.

And now, no sooner was everyone assembled than he drew forth from a basket a piece of

 

paper covered with scribbled lines and pretended to read from it. With a show of hesitation he

 

looked up and down his “list” for the objects to be given in exchange for his people’s

 

presents. To so and so a bow and arrows, a machete! and another a string of beads! for his

 

necklaces—and so on for

((126))

two solid hours. What was he hoping for? To deceive himself, perhaps: but, even more, to

 

amaze his companions and persuade them that his intermediacy was responsible for the

 

exchanges, that he had allied himself with the white man, and that he could now share in his

 

secrets. We were in a hurry to get away, since there would obviously be a moment of real

 

danger at which all the marvels L had brought would have been handed over. . . . So I did not

 

go further into the matter and we set off on the return journey, still guided by the Indians [p.

 

289].

The story is very beautiful. It is in fact tempting to read it as a parable in which each element,

 

each semanteme, refers to a recognized function of writing: hierarchization, the economic

 

function of mediation and of capi

talization, participation in a quasi-religious secret; all this,

 

verified in any phenomenon of writing, is here assembled, concentrated, organized in the

 

structure of an exemplary event or a very brief sequence of fact and ges

tures. All the organic

 

complexity of writing is here collected within the simple focus of a parable.

B. The rememoration of the scene. 

Let us now pass on to the lesson of the lesson. It is longer

 

than the relation of the incident, covers three very dense pages, and the text of the

 

Conversations, 

which reproduces the essen

tial parts of it, is considerably briefer. It is

 

therefore in the thesis that the incident is reported without theoretical commentary and in the

 

anthro

pologist’s confession that the theory is most abundantly developed.

Let us follow the thread of the demonstration through the evocation of apparently

 

unquestionable historical facts. It is the split between the factual certainty and its

 




interpretative reconsideration that will be of special inter-est to us. The most serious split

 

appears first, but not only, between the meager fact of the “extraordinary incident” and the

 

general philosophy of writing. The point of the incident in effect supports an enormous theo

-

retical edifice.

After the “extraordinary incident,” the anthropologist’s situation re-mains precarious. Certain

 

words dominate the description: “abortive meet-ing,” “mystifications,” “something irritating,”

 

the anthropologist “suddenly ... found . . . [himself] alone, and lost, in the middle of the bush,”

 

“in despair,” “demoralized,” he “was no longer armed” in a “hostile zone” and he is agitated

 

by “dark thoughts.” Then the threat subsides, the hostility disappears. It is night, the incident

 

is closed, the exchanges have taken place; it is time to reflect upon the story, it is the moment

 

of wakefulness and rememoration. “Still tormented by this absurd incident, I slept badly. To

 

while away the hours I went back, in my mind, to the scene of the previous morning.”

Two significances are quickly drawn from the incident itself.

1. The appearance of writing is 

instantaneous. 

It is not prepared for. Such a leap would prove

 

that the possibility of writing does not inhabit

((127))

speech, but the outside of speech. “So writing had made its appearance among the

 

Nambikwara! But not at all, as one might have supposed, as the result of a laborious

 

apprenticeship.” From what does Lévi-Strauss arrive at this epigenetism that is indispensable

 

if one wishes to safeguard the exteriority of writing to speech? From the incident? But the

 

scene was not the scene of the 

origin, 

but only that of the 

imitation 

of writing. Even if it were

 

a question of writing, what has the character of suddenness here is not the passage to writing,

 

the invention of writing, but the importation of an already constituted writing. It is a

 

borrowing and an artificial borrowing. As Lévi-Strauss himself says: “The symbol had been

 

borrowed, but the reality remained quite foreign to them” [p. zqo]. Besides, this character of

 

sudden

ness obviously belongs to all the phenomena of the diffusion or transmis

sion of

 

writing. It could never describe the appearance of writing, which has, on the contrary, been

 

laborious, progressive, and differentiated in its stages. And the rapidity of the borrowing,

 

when it happens, presupposes the previous presence of the structures that make it possible.

2. The second significance that Lévi-Strauss believes he can read in the very text of the scene

 

is connected to the first. Since they learned without understanding, since the Chief used

 

writing effectively without knowing either the way it functioned or the content signified by it,

 

the end of writ-ing is political and not theoretical, 

“sociological, rather than . . . intellec

tual”

 

[p. 290]. This opens and covers the entire space within which Lévi-Strauss is now going to

 

think writing.

The symbol had been borrowed, but the reality remained quite foreign to them. Even the

 

borrowing had had a sociological, rather than an intellectual object: for it was not a question

 

of knowing specific things, or understanding them, or keeping them in mind, but merely of

 

enhancing the prestige and authority of one individual—or one function—at the expense of

 

the rest of the party. A native, still in the period of the stone age, had realized that even if he

 

could not himself understand the great instrument of understanding he could at least make it

 

serve other ends [p. 2901.




Distinguishing thus “the sociological” from the “intellectual end,” at

tributing the former and

 

not the latter to writing, one credits a very problematic difference between intersubjective

 

relationship and knowledge. If it is true, as I in fact believe, that writing cannot be thought

 

outside of the horizon of intersubjective violence, is there anything, even science, that

 

radically escapes it? Is there a knowledge, and, above all, a language, scien

tific or not, that

 

one can call alien at once to writing and to violence? If one answers in the negative, as I do,

 

the use of these concepts to discern the specific character of writing is not pertinent. So much

 

so that all the examples 

23

 by which Lévi-Strauss next illustrates this proposition are of

 

course true and probing, but too much so. The conclusion that they sustain goes far beyond

 

the field of what is here called “writing” (“writing” in the

((128))

usual sense). It also covers the field of unwritten speech. In other words, if writing is to be

 

related to violence, writing appears well before writing in the narrow sense; already in the

 

differance or the arche-writing that opens speech itself.

Thus suggesting what he will later confirm, that the essential function of writing is to favor

 

the enslaving power rather than “disinterested” science, according to the distinction he seems

 

to hold, Lévi-Strauss now can, in a second wave of meditation, neutralize the frontier between

 

peoples without and with writing; not with regard to the use of writing, but with regard to

 

what is supposed to be deducible from it, with regard to their historicity or nonhistoricity. This

 

neutralization is very valuable; it author

izes the themes (a) of the essential and irreducible

 

relativity in the per

ception of historical movement (cf. 

Race et Histoire), 

(b) of the differ

ences

 

between “warm” and “cold” in the “historical temperature” of socie

ties 

(Conversations, 

p. 

43

 

[pp. 38–39] 

and passim), (c) of the relationships between anthropology and history. 24

Thus, given this trust in the presumed difference between knowledge and power, it is a matter

 

of showing that writing is not at all pertinent to the appreciation of historical rhythms and

 

types; the age of the wholesale creation of social, economic, technical, political, and other

 

structures, upon which we still subsist—the neolithic age—did not know writing. 

25

 What

 

does this imply?

In the text that follows, I shall isolate three potentially controversial propositions. I shall not

 

engage in the controversy, because I want to pro

ceed more quickly to the end of the argument

 

that interests Lévi-Strauss and to situate the debate there.

First Proposition.

After eliminating all the criteria by which people habitually distinguish civili

zation from

 

barbarism, this one should at least be retained: that certain peoples write and others do not.

 

The first group can accumulate a body of knowledge [earlier acquisitions—acquisitions

 

anciennes] 

that helps it to move ever faster toward the goal that it has assigned to itself; the

 

second is confined within limits that the memory of individuals can never hope to extend, and

 

it must remain the prisoner of a history worked out from day to day, with neither an origin nor

 

the lasting consciousness of a plan. Yet nothing of what we know of writing, or of its role in

 

evolution, can be said to justify this conception [P. 291].

This proposition has meaning only on two conditions:




1. That one take no notice of the idea and the project of science, of the idea, that is, of truth as

 

a theoretically infinite transmissibility; this has an historical possibility only with writing.

 

Faced with the Husserlian analyses 

(Krisis 

and 

The Origin of Geometry) 

which remind us of

 

this evi

dence, Lévi-Strauss’s proposal can be sustained only by denying all spec-

((129))

ificity to the scientific project and to the value of truth in general. This last position does not

 

lack force, but it cannot show the worth and coherence of that force except by relinquishing

 

its claim to be a scientific discourse. A well-known pattern. It is in 

fact 

what seems to be

 

happening here.

2. 

That the Neolithic, to which in fact may be attributed the creation of the deep structures

 

upon which we still live, did not know anything like writing. It is here that the concept of

 

writing, as it is used by a modern anthropologist, would seem singularly narrow.

 

Anthropology today gives us a great deal of information about scripts that preceded the

 

alphabet, about other systems of phonetic writing or systems quite ready to be phoneticized.

 

The weight of this information makes it unnecessary for us to insist.

Second Proposition. 

Supposing every thing was acquired before writing, Lévi-Strauss has

 

only to argue:

Conversely, between the invention of writing and the birth of modem science, the western

 

world has lived through some five thousand years, during which time the sum of its

 

knowledge has rather 

gone up and down 

than known 

a steady in-crease 

[p. 292] (italics

 

added).

One could be shocked by this affirmation, but I shall avoid that. I do not believe that such an

 

affirmation is 

false. 

But no more do I believe that it is 

true. 

It is rather an answer, suiting a

 

particular purpose, to a meaning-less question. 26 Is not the notion of the quantity of

 

knowledge suspect? What is a quantity of knowledge? How is it modified? Without speaking

 

of the science of order or of quality, we may wonder what the quantity of the science of pure

 

quantity signifies. How can it be evaluated in quantity? Such questions can only be answered

 

in the style of pure empiricity. Unless one attempts to respect the very complex laws of the

 

capitalization of learn-ing, something that cannot be done without considering writing more

 

at

tentively. One can say the opposite of what Lévi-Strauss says and it would be neither truer

 

nor more false. One can say that during such and such a half-century, even before “modern

 

science,” and today every minute, the accretion of knowledge has gone infinitely beyond what

 

it was for millennia. So much for accretion. As for the notion of fluctuation, it presents itself

 

as perfectly empirical. In anv case, propositions of essence can never be made to fit a scale.

Third Proposition. 

It is the most disconcerting step in the development of this paragraph. Let

 

us suppose that the advent of writing three or four thousand years ago had brought nothing

 

decisive in the domain of knowl

edge. Lévi-Strauss concedes nevertheless that it has not at all

 

been the same thing for the last two centuries. However, according to his own scale, it is not

 

clear what justifies this cut-off point. Yet it is there: “Doubtless the scientific expansion of the

 

nineteenth and twentieth centuries could hardly

((130))




have occurred, had writing not existed. But this condition, however neces

sary, cannot in itself

 

explain that expansion” [p. 

292]

Not only is the cut-off point surprising, but one also wonders what par

ticular objection Lévi-

Strauss seems to reject here. No one has ever thought that writing—the written notation, since

 

that is at issue here—was the suf

ficient condition of science; and that it would suffice to know

 

how to write in order to be learned. Much has been written that would suffice to rid us of this

 

illusion if we possessed it. But to recognize that writing is the “neces

sary condition” of

 

science, that there is no science without writing, is what is important, and Lévi-Strauss knows

 

this. And as it is difficult in any rigor

ous way to place the beginnings of science in the

 

nineteenth century, his entire argument founders on or is contaminated by the gross mark of

 

em

pirical approximation.

In truth this depends—and that is why I pass over this argument quickly —on the fact that

 

Lévi-Strauss is determined to abandon this terrain, to explain very quickly why the problem

 

of science is not the best access to the origin and function of writing: “If we want to correlate

 

the appearance of writing with certain other characteristics of civilization, we must look

 

elsewhere” [p. 292). Thus it must rather be demonstrated that, according to the dissociation

 

which had perplexed us, the origin of writing responded to a more “sociological” than

 

“intellectual” necessity. The following page must therefore not only make clear this

 

sociological necessity—which would be a poor truism and would have little enough to do

 

with the sociological specificity of writing—but also that this social necessity is that of

 

“domina

tion,” “exploitation,” “enslavement,” and “perfidy.”

To read this page appropriately, one must differentiate it into its strata. The author presents

 

here what he calls his “hypothesis:” “If my hypothesis is correct, the primary function of

 

writing, as a means of communication, is to facilitate 27 the enslavement of other human

 

beings.” On a first level, this hypothesis is so quickly confirmed that it hardly merits its name.

 

These facts are well known. It has long been known that the power of writing in the hands of

 

a small number, caste, or class, is always contemporaneous with hierarchization, let us say

 

with political differance; it is at the same time distinction into groups, classes, and levels of

 

economico-politico

technical power, and delegation of authority, power deferred and aban

-

doned to an organ of capitalization. This phenomenon is produced from the very onset of

 

sedentarization; with the constitution of stocks at the origin of agricultural societies. Here

 

things are so patent 28 that the empirical illustration that Lévi-Strauss sketches could be

 

infinitely enriched. This entire structure appears as soon as a society begins to live as a

 

society, that is to say from the origin of life in general, when, at very heterogeneous levels of

 

organization and complexity, it is possible to 

defer presence, 

that is to say 

expense 

or

 

consumption, and to organize production, that is to say

((131))

reserve 

in general. This is produced well before the appearance of writing in the narrow sense,

 

but it is true, and one cannot ignore it, that the appear

ance of certain systems of writing three

 

or four thousand years ago was an extraordinary leap in the history of life. All the more

 

extraordinary because a prodigious expansion of the power of differance was not

 

accompanied,, at least during these millennia, by any notable transformation of the organism.

 

It is precisely the property of the power of differance to modify life less and less as it spreads

 

out more and more. If it should grow infinite—and its essence excludes this a priori—life

 




itself would be made into an impassive, intangible, and eternal presence: infinite differance,

 

God or death.

This leads us to a second level of reading. It will show, at the same time, Lévi-Strauss’s final

 

intention, toward which the demonstration orients the factual evidence, as well as the political

 

ideology that, in the name of a Marxist hypothesis, is articulated with the finest example of

 

what I have called the “metaphysics of presence.”

Previously the empirical character of the analyses concerning the status of science and the

 

accumulation of knowledge removed all rigor from each of the propositions advanced and

 

permitted their consideration with an equal pertinence as true or false. It is the pertinence of

 

the question which appeared doubtful. The same thing happens here again. ‘What is going to

 

be called 

enslavement 

can equally legitimately be called 

liberation. 

And it is at the moment

 

that this oscillation is 

stopped 

on the signification of enslavement that the discourse is frozen

 

into a determined ideology that we would judge disturbing if such were our first

 

preoccupation here.

In this text, Lévi-Strauss does not distinguish between hierarchization and domination,

 

between political authority and exploitation. The tone that pervades these reflections is of an

 

anarchism that deliberately con-founds law and oppression. The idea of law and positive right,

 

although it is difficult to think them in their formality—where it is so general that ignorance

 

of the law is no defense—before the possibility of writing, is determined by Lévi-Strauss as

 

constraint and enslavement. Political power can only be the custodian of an unjust power. A

 

classical and coherent thesis, but here advanced as self-evident, without opening the least bit

 

of critical dialogue with the holders of the other thesis, according to which the generality of

 

the law is on the contrary the condition of liberty in the city. No dialogue, for example, with

 

Rousseau who would no doubt have shuddered to see a self-proclaimed disciple define law as

 

follows:

Writing may not have sufficed to consolidate human knowledge, but it may well have been

 

indispensable to the consolidation of dominions. To bring the matter nearer to our own time:

 

the European-wide movement towards com

pulsory education in the nineteenth century went

 

hand in hand with the ex-tension of military service and with proletarization. The struggle

 

against illiteracy is thus indistinguishable from the increased powers exerted over the

 

individual

((132))

citizen by the central authority. For it is only when everyone can read that Authority can

 

decree that “ignorance of law is no defence.” 29

One must be careful in order to appreciate these grave declarations. One must above all avoid

 

reversing them and taking the opposite view. In a certain given historical structure—for

 

example, in the age of which Lévi-Strauss speaks—it is undoubtedly true that the progress of

 

formal legality, the struggle against illiteracy, and the like, could have functioned as a

 

mystifying force and an instrument consolidating the power of a class or a state whose formal-

universal significance was confiscated by a par

ticular empirical force. Perhaps this necessity

 

is indispensable and impossi

ble to supersede. But to derive from it the authority to define the

 

law and the state in a simple and univocal manner, to condemn them from an ethical point of

 

view, and with them the extension of writing, compulsory military service and proletarization,

 




the generality of political obligation and the idea that “ignorance of the law is no defense,” is

 

a consequence that cannot be rigorously deduced from these premises. If they are never

theless

 

deduced, as here, it must also be concluded that nonexploitation, liberty and the like “go hand

 

in hand” (to utilize this most equivocal concept) with illiteracy and the absence of compulsory

 

military service, public instruction or law in general. I shall not belabor the obvious.

Let us beware of opposing Lévi-Strauss to the system of classical argu

ments, or of opposing

 

him to himself (on the preceding page, he had linked the violence of writing to the fact that it

 

was reserved for a minority, confiscated by the scribes in the service of a caste. Now, an

 

enslaving vio

lence is assigned to total literacy.) The incoherence is only apparent; uni

versality

 

is always monopolized as empirical force by a determined empirical force, such is the unique

 

affirmation that is common to both these propositions.

In order to tackle this problem, should one wonder what the meaning of enslavement to a law

 

of universal form can be? One could do it, but it is better to give up that classical course; it

 

would soon enough show us that the access to writing is the constitution of a free subject in

 

the violent move-ment of its own effacement and of its own bondage. A movement unthink

-

able within the classical concepts of ethics, psychology, political philosophy, and

 

metaphysics. Let us leave that proposition up in the air, for We have not yet finished reading

 

the writing “Lesson.”

For Lévi-Strauss goes further under the auspices of this libertarian ideology, whose

 

anticolonialist and antiethnocentric hue is rather specific:

All this moved rapidly from the national to the international level, thanks to the mutual

 

complicity which sprang up between new-bom states—confronted as these were with the

 

problems that had been our own, a century or two ago—

((133))

and an international society of peoples long privileged. These latter recognize that their

 

stability may well be endangered by nations whose knowledge of the written word has not, as

 

yet, empowered them to think in formulae which can be modified at will. Such nations are not

 

yet ready to be “edified;” and when they are first given the freedom of the library shelves 

[au

 

savoir 

entassé 

dans les bibliothèques] 

they are perilously vulnerable to the ever more

 

deliberately misleading (mendacious—mensonges] effects of the printed word (italics added).

Taking the same precautions that we took a moment ago with respect to the possible

 

truthfulness of such statements, let us paraphrase this text. It is, in the name of the liberty of

 

formerly colonized peoples, a critique of the young states that side with the old states so

 

recently denounced (“complicity . . . between young states . . . and an international society of

 

peoples long privileged”). Critique of an “enterprise:” the propagation of writing is presented

 

through the concepts of a voluntarist psychology, the international political phenomenon that

 

it constitutes is described in terms of a deliberately and consciously organized plot. A critique

 

of the State in general and of the young States that extend writing for propa

gandistic ends, to

 

assure the legibility and effectiveness of their tracts, to protect themselves from “nations

 

whose knowledge of the written word has not, as yet, empowered them to think in formulae

 

which can be modi

fied at will.” Which implies that oral formulae are not modifiable, not more

 

modifiable at will than written formulae. This is not the least of the paradoxes. Yet once again,

 

I do not profess that writing may not and does not in fact play this role, but from that to

 




attribute to writing the specificity of this role and to conclude that speech is exempt from it, is

 

an abyss that one must not leap over so lightly. I shall not comment on what is said about

 

access to “[knowledge 

piled up on] 

library shelves,” determined in an unequivocal way as

 

vulnerability to the “mendacious effects of the printed word” and so on. The ideological

 

atmosphere within which such formulae breathe 

today 

could be described. Suffice it to

 

recognize here the heritage of the second 

Discourse 

(“throwing aside, therefore, all those

 

scientific books . . . and contemplating the first and most simple operations of the human soul

 

. . .” [p. 157] “O man, . . . behold your history, such as I have thought to read it, not in books

 

written by your fellow-creatures, who are liars, but in nature, which never lies” [p. 1761), of

 

Emile 

(“The misuse of books is the death of learning . . .” “. . . so many books lead us to

 

neglect the book of the world ...” “. . . we should not read, but rather look.” “I get rid of the

 

chief cause of their sorrows, namely their books. Reading is the curse of childhood.” “The

 

child who reads ceases to think,” etc.), of 

A Savoyard Priest (“So 

I closed all my books ...”),

 

(pp. 574, 575, 186, 378) [pp. 414, 415, 131, 270] of the 

Lettre å Christophe de Beaumont

((134))

(“I looked for truth in books: I found in them nothing but lies and error”). *

After this nocturnal meditation, Lévi-Strauss returns to the “extraordi

nary incident.” And it is

 

to give praise, now justified by history, to those wise Nambikwara who had the courage to

 

resist writing as well as the mystification of their leader. Praise to those who knew to interrupt

—only for a time, alas—the fatal course of evolution and who “[won] themselves a respite.”

 

In this respect and with regard to what concerns Nambikwara society, the anthropologist is

 

resolutely conservative. As he will note about a hundred pages later, “at home, the

 

anthropologist may be a natural subversive, a convinced opponent of traditional usage: but no

 

sooner has he in focus a society different from his own than he becomes respectful of even the

 

most conservative practices” [p. 380].

Two motifs in the concluding lines: on the one hand, as with Rousseau, the theme of a

 

necessary or rather fatal degradation, as the very form of progress; on the other hand,

 

nostalgia for what preceded this degradation, an affective impulse toward the islets of

 

resistance, the small communities that have provisionally protected themselves from

 

corruption (cf. 

Con

versations, 

p. 49 [p. 41] on this subject), a corruption linked, as in

 

Rousseau, to writing and to the dislocation of a unanimous people assem

bled in the sell-

presence of its speech. We shall return to this. Let us read: “Doubtless the die is already cast”

 

(the question here is the fatal evolution into which peoples who were hitherto protected from

 

writing are already seduced; a more fatalistic than determinable proposition. The historical

 

concatenation is thought under the concept of play and chance. The fre

quent metaphor of the

 

player in Lévi-Strauss’s texts must be studied) . “But in 

my 

Nambikwara village people [in the

 

original 

“fortes têtes,” 

“strong-minded people”] were not so easily taken in” (italics added).

These strong-minded people are the resisters, those whom their leader could not trick, and

 

who have more character than subtlety, more heart and traditional pride than openness of

 

mind.

Those who moved away from him, after he had tried to play the civilized man (after my visit

 

he was abandoned by most of his followers), must have had a confused understanding of the

 

fact that writing, on this its first appearance in their midst, had allied itself with falsehood; and

 

so they had taken refuge, deeper in the bush, to win themselves a respite [p. 293].




(The episode of this resistance is also given in the thesis, p. 89.)

1.—If words have a meaning, and if “writing, on this its first appearance in their midst, had

 

allied itself with falsehood,” one should think that de

ception and all the associated values and

 

nonvalues were absent in societies

((135))

without writing. To doubt this it is not necessary to cover a lot of ground; only an empirical

 

detour by the evocation of facts, the aprioric or transcen

dental regression that we followed by

 

way of introduction. Recalling in this introduction that violence did not wait for the

 

appearance of writing in the narrow sense, that writing has always begun in language, we, like

 

Lévi-Strauss, conclude that violence is writing. But, coming at it another way, this proposition

 

has a radically different meaning. It ceases to be sup-ported by the myth of myth, by the myth

 

of a speech originally good, and of a violence which would come to pounce upon it as a fatal

 

accident. A fatal accident which is nothing but history itself. Not that, by this more or less

 

overt reference to the idea of a fall into evil from the innocence of the word, Lévi-Strauss

 

makes this classical and implicit theology his own. It is just that his anthropological discourse

 

is produced through concepts, sche

mata, and values that are, systematically and

 

genealogically, accomplices of this theology and this metaphysics.

Therefore I shall not make the long empirical or aprioric disgression here. I shall merely

 

compare different moments in the description of Nambik

wara society. If the “Lesson” is to be

 

believed, the Nambikwara did not know violence before writing; nor hierarchization, since

 

that is quickly assimilated into exploitation. Round about the “Lesson,” it suffices to open

 

Tristes Tropiques 

and the thesis at any page to find striking evidence to the contrary. We are

 

dealing here not only with a strongly hierarchized society, but with a society where

 

relationships are marked with a spectacular violence. As spectacular as the innocent and

 

tender frolics evoked at the beginning of the “Lesson,” and that we were thus justified in

 

considering as the calculated premises of a loaded argument.

Among many analogous passages that we cannot cite here, let us look at page 87 of the

 

dissertation. The subject is clearly the Nambikwara before writing:

And the leader must display an unfailing talent, related more to electoral poli-tics than to the

 

exercise of power, to maintain his group, and, if possible, enlarge it through new

 

memberships. The nomadic band represents in fact a fragile unity. If the leader’s authority is

 

too exacting, if he monopolizes too great a number of women, if he is not capable—during

 

periods of dearth—of resolving problems of food, discontent arises, individuals or families

 

break away and con-glomerate into a kindred group whose affairs seem better conducted;

 

better nourished due to the discovery of hunting- or fruit-and-berry-picking grounds, or richer

 

through exchange with neighboring groups, or more powerful after victorious battles. The

 

leader then finds himself at the head of too limited a group, incapable of facing daily

 

difficulties, or whose women are open to rape by stronger neighbors. He is then obliged to

 




abdicate, and with his last faithful friends, to throw in his lot with a more fortunate faction;

 

Nambikwara society is thus in a perpetual state of flux; groups form and unform, enlarge and

 

dis-

((136))

appear and, sometimes at intervals of a few months, the composition, number, and regrouping

 

of the bands become unrecognizable. All these transformations are accompanied by intrigues

 

and conflicts, rises and falls, all being produced at an extremely fast pace.

One could also cite entire chapters of the thesis entitled “War and Commerce,” and “From

 

Birth to Death.” Also everything concerning the use of poisons, in the thesis and in 

Tristes

 

Tropiques; 

just as there is a battle of proper names, there is a battle of poisons in which the

 

anthropolo

gist is himself embroiled:

A delegation of four men came to me and, in a quite threatening tone, asked me to mix poison

 

(which they brought me at the same time) with the next dish that I should offer to A6; it was

 

considered indispensable to suppress him rapidly, because, I was told, he was “very wicked”

 

(kakore) “and totally worthless” (aidotiene) (p. 124).

I shall cite only one more passage, happy complement of an idyllic description :

I have described the tender comradeship which presides over the relationship between the

 

sexes, and the general harmony which reigns in the bosom of the groups. But as soon as these

 

change for the worse, it is to make room for the most extreme solutions: poisonings and

 

assassinations. . . . No South American group, to our knowledge, conveys in so sincere and

 

spontaneous a manner .. . violent and opposed sentiments, whose individual expression seems

 

indissociable from a social stylization that never betrays them (p. 126) .

(Is this final formula not applicable to all social groups in general?)

2.—Thus we are led back to Rousseau. The ideal profoundly underlying this philosophy of

 

writing is therefore the image of a community immedi

ately present to itself, without

 

difference, a community of speech where all the members are within earshot. To confirm this,

 

I shall refer neither to 

Tristes Tropiques 

nor to its theoretical echo (the 

Conversations), 

but to

 

a text included in 

Structural Anthropology 

and completed in 1958 with allusions to 

Tristes

 

Tropiques. 

Writing is here defined as the condition of 

social inauthenticity:

In this respect it is, rather, modem societies that should be defined by a privative character.

 

Our relations with one another are now only occasionally and frag

mentarily based upon

 

global experience, 

the concrete “apprehension” of one person by another. 

They are largely

 

the result of a [indirect] construction, through written documents. We are no longer linked to

 

our past by an oral tra

dition which implies 

direct [vécu] contact 

with others (storytellers,

 

priests, wise men, or elders), but by books 

amassed 

in libraries, books from which criticism

 

endeavors—with extreme difficulty—to form a picture of their authors. And we communicate

 

with the immense majority of our contemporaries by all kinds of intermediaries—written

 

documents or administrative machinery—which un-

((137))




doubtedly vastly extend our contacts but at the same time make those contacts somewhat

 

“unauthentic.” 

This has become typical of the relationship between the citizen and the public

 

authorities. We should like to avoid describing nega

tively the tremendous revolution brought

 

about by the invention of writing. But it is essential to realize that writing, while it conferred

 

vast benefits on humanity, did in.fact deprive it of something fundamental. (pp. 400—o2;

 

italics added) [pp. 363–64]

From then on, the anthropologist’s mission carries an ethical significance: to find and fix on

 

that terrain the “levels of authenticity.” The criterion of authenticity is the “neighborliness” in

 

the small communities where “every-one knows everyone else.”

On the contrary, if we carefully consider the points on which anthropological investigations

 

have been brought to bear, we note that in its increasingly inten

sive study of modern societies,

 

anthropology has endeavored to identify 

levels of authenticity 

within them. When the

 

ethnologist studies a village, an enterprise, or the neighborhood of a large town, his task is

 

facilitated by the fact that almost everyone knows everyone else. . . . In the future, it will no

 

doubt be recognized that anthropology’s most important contribution to social sciences is to

 

have introduced, if unknowingly, this fundamental distinction between two types of social

 

existence: a way of life recognized at the outset as traditional and archaic and characteristic of

 

“authentic” societies and a more modem form of existence, from which the first-named type is

 

not absent but where groups that are not completely, or are imperfectly, “authentic” are

 

organized within a much larger and specifically “unauthentic” system (pp. 402–03) [pp. 364–

65].

The clarity of this text is sufficient unto itself. “In the future, it may be recognized” if this is in

 

fact “anthropology’s most important contribution to social science.” This model of a small

 

community with a “crystalline” structure, completely sell-present, assembled in its own

 

neighborhood, is undoubtedly Rousseauistic.

We shall have to examine this very closely in more than one text. For the moment, and always

 

for the same reasons, let us rather turn to the 

Essay. 

Rousseau shows there that social

 

distance, 

the dispersion of the neighbor-hood, is the condition of oppression, arbitrariness,

 

and vice. The govern

ments of oppression all make the same gesture: to break presence, the

 

co-presence of citizens, the unanimity of “assembled peoples,” to create a situation of

 

dispersion, holding subjects so far apart as to be incapable of feeling themselves together in

 

the space of one and the same speech, one and the same persuasive exchange. This

 

phenomenon is described in the last chapter of the 

Essay. 

The now recognized ambiguity of

 

this structure is such that one can equally well reverse its direction and show that this co-

presence is sometimes also that of the crowd subjected to a demagogic harangue. We must

 

attend to the signs of Rousseau’s vigilance when con-fronted by the possibility of such a

 

reversal. Nevertheless, the 

Essay 

first

((138))

puts us on guard against the structures of social life and of information within the modern

 

political machine. It is a praise of eloquence or rather of the elocution of the full speech, a

 

condemnation of mute and im-personal signs: money, tracts (“placards”), weapons and

 

soldiers in uniform:




The languages develop naturally on the basis of men’s needs, changing and varying as those

 

needs change. In ancient times, when persuasion played the role of public force, eloquence

 

was necessary. Of what use would it be today, when public force has replaced persuasion. One

 

needs neither art nor metaphor to say 

such 

is 

my pleasure. 

What sort of public discourses

 

remain then? Sermons. And why should those who preach them be concerned to persuade the

 

people, since it is not they who dispose of benefices. Our popular tongues have become just as

 

completely useless as eloquence. Societies have assumed their final form: no longer is

 

anything changed except by arms and cash. And since there is nothing to say to people besides

 

give money, 

it is said with placards on street corners or by soldiers in their homes. It is not

 

necessary to assemble anyone for that. On the contrary, the subjects must be kept apart. That

 

is the first maxim of modern politics. . . . It was easy for the ancients to make themselves

 

under-stood by people in public. They could speak all day with no discomfort... . If a man

 

were to harangue the people of Paris in the Place Vendôme in French, if he shouted at the top

 

of his voice, people would hear him shouting, but they would not be able to distinguish a

 

word. . . . If charlatans are less common in the public squares of France than in those of Italy,

 

it is not because they would be less well heard 

[écoutés] 

in France, but only because they

 

would not be as well understood 

[entendus] . . . . 

But I say that any tongue with which one

 

can-not make oneself understood to the people assembled is a slavish tongue. It is impossible

 

for a people to remain free and speak the tongue (Chap. 1o, “Rela

tionship of Langauges to

 

Government”) [pp. 72-73].

Self-presence, transparent proximity in the face-to-face of countenances and the immediate

 

range of the voice, this determination of social au

thenticity is therefore classic: Rousseauistic

 

but already the inheritor of Platonism, it relates, we recall, to the Anarchistic and Libertarian

 

protesta

tions against Law, the Powers, and the State in general, and also with the dream of the

 

nineteenth-century Utopian Socialisms, most specifically with the dream of Fourierism. In his

 

laboratory, or rather in his studio, the anthropologist too uses this dream, as one weapon or

 

instrument among others. Serving the same obstinate desire within which the anthropologist

 

“always puts something of himself,” this tool must come to terms with other “means to hand.”

 

For the anthropologist also desires to be Freudian, Marxist (with a “Marxism,” as we recall,

 

whose work of criticism would be neither in “opposition” nor in “contradiction” with

 

“Buddhist criticism”) and he even confesses to being tempted by “vulgar materialism.” 30

The only weakness of 

bricolage—but, 

seen as a weakness is it not irremediable?—is a total

 

inability to justify itself in its own discourse. The

((139))

already-there-ness of instruments and of concepts cannot be undone or re-invented. In that

 

sense, the passage from desire to discourse always loses itself in 

bricolage, 

it builds its castles

 

with debris (“Mythical thought .. . builds ideological castles out of the debris of what was

 

once a social dis-course.” 

The Savage Mind, 

p. 

32 

[p. 21]). In the best of cases, the discourse

 

of 

bricolage 

can confess itself, confess in itself its desire and its defeat, pro-voke the thought

 

of the essence and the necessity of the already-there, recognize that the most radical

 

discourse, the most inventive and systematic engineer are surprised and circumvented by a

 

history, a language, etc., a 

world 

(for “world” means nothing else) from which they must

 

borrow their tools, if only to destroy the former machine (the strop-catapult 

[bricole] 

seems

 

originally to have been a machine of war or the hunt, constructed to destroy. And who can

 

believe the image of the peaceful 

bricoleur?). 

The idea of the engineer breaking with all

 

bricolage is 

dependent on a creation-ist theology. Only such a theology can sanction an

 




essential and rigorous difference between the engineer and the 

bricoleur. 

But that the engineer

 

should always be a sort of 

bricoleur 

should not ruin all criticism of 

bricolage; 

quite the

 

contrary. Criticism in what sense? First of all, if the difference between 

bricoleur 

and engineer

 

is basically theological, the very concept of 

bricolage 

implies a fall and an accidental finitude.

 

This techno-theological significance must be abandoned in order to think the originary

 

appurte

nance of desire to discourse, of discourse to the history of the world, and the already-

three-ness of the language in which desire deludes itself. Then, even supposing that, 

by

 

bricolage, 

one conserves the idea of 

bricolage, 

one must know that all 

bricolages 

are not

 

equally worthwhile. 

Bricolage 

criti

cizes itself.

Finally, the value of “social authenticity” is one of the two indispensa

ble poles of the structure

 

of morality in general. The ethic of the living word would be perfectly respectable,

 

completely utopian and a-topic 

[utopique et atopique] 

as it is (unconnected to 

spacing 

and to

 

differ

ance as writing), it would be as respectable as respect itself if it did not live on a

 

delusion and a nonrespect for its own condition of origin, if it did not dream in speech of a

 

presence denied to writing, denied by writ-ing. The ethic of speech is the 

delusion 

of presence

 

mastered. Like the 

bri

cole, 

the delusion or lure designates first a hunter’s stratagem. It is a

 

term of falconry: “a piece of red feather,” says Littré, “in the form of a bird, which serves to

 

recall the bird of prey when it does not return straight to the fist.” Example: “. . . the master

 

called, made a feint,/Held fist and lure toward what seemed turned to stone, . . .” 

(La

 

Fontaine) 

[Fables, XII, 

12; 

The Fables of La Fontaine, 

tr. 

Marianne Moore (New York, 1952),

P• 294]

To recognize writing in speech, that is to say differance and the absence of speech, is to begin

 

to think the lure. There is no ethics without the

((140))

presence 

of the other 

but also, and consequently, without absence, dis-simulation, detour,

 

differance, writing. The arche-writing is the origin of morality as of immorality. The

 

nonethical opening of ethics. A violent opening. As in the case of the vulgar concept of

 

writing, the ethical in-stance of violence must be rigorously suspended in order to repeat the

 

genealogy of morals.

Since they both scorn writing, Rousseau and Lévi-Strauss both praise the range of the voice.

 

Nevertheless, in the texts that we must now read, Rousseau is suspicious also of the illusion of

 

full and present speech, of the illusion of presence within a speech believed to be transparent

 

and inno

cent. It is toward the praise of silence that the myth of a full presence wrenched from

 

differance and from the violence of the word is then devi

ated. Nevertheless, in a certain way,

 

“public force” has already begun to “compensate for 

[suppléer] 

persuasion.”

It is perhaps time to reread the 

Essay on the Origin of Languages.

((141))

2. “...That Dangerous Supplement . . .”

How people will cry out against me! I hear from afar the shouts of that false wisdom which

 

is ever dragging us onwards, counting the present as nothing, and pursuing without a

 




pause a future which flies as we pursue, that false wisdom which removes us from our

 

place and never brings us to any othe

r.—Emile

All the papers which I have collected to fill the gaps in my memory and to guide me in my

 

undertaking, have passed into other hands, and will never return to mine.

—Confessions

I have implied it repeatedly: the praise of living speech, as it 

preoccupies 

Lévi-Strauss’s

 

discourse, is faithful to only one particular motif in Rousseau. This motif comes to terms with

 

and is organized by its contrary: a per

petually reanimated mistrust with regard to the so-called

 

full speech. In the spoken address, presence is at once promised and refused. The speech that

 

Rousseau raised above writing is speech as it should be or rather as it 

should have been. 

And

 

we must pay attention to that mode, to that tense which relates us to presence within living

 

colloquy. 

In fact, 

Rousseau had tested the concealment within speech itself, in the mirage of

 

its immediacy. He had recognized and analyzed it with incomparable acu

men. We are

 

dispossessed of the longed-for presence in the gesture of language by which we attempt to

 

seize it. To the experience of the “robber robbed” that Starobinski admirably describes in

 

L’oeil vivant 

[Paris, 1961]. Jean Jacques is subjected not only in the play of the mirror image

 

which “captures his reflection and exposes his presence” (p. 109) . It lies in wait for us from

 

the first word. The speculary dispossession which at the same time institutes and deconstitutes

 

me is also a law of language. It operates as a power of death in the heart of living speech: a

 

power all the more re-doubtable because it opens as much as it threatens the possibility of the

 

spoken word.

Having in a certain way recognized this power which, inaugurating speech, dislocates the

 

subject that it constructs, prevents it from being present to its signs, torments its language

 

with a complete writing, Rousseau is nevertheless more pressed to exorcise it than to assume

 

its necessity. That is why, straining toward the reconstruction of presence, he valorizes and

((142))

disqualifies writing at the same time. At the same time; that is to say, in one divided but

 

coherent movement. We must try not to lose sight of its strange unity. Rousseau condemns

 

writing as destruction of presence and as disease of speech. He rehabilitates it to the extent

 

that it promises the reappropriation of that of which speech allowed itself to be dispossessed.

 

But by what, if not already a writing older than speech and already installed in that place?

The first movement of this desire is formulated as a theory of language. The other governs the

 

experience of the writer. In the 

Confessions, 

when Jean-Jacques tries to explain how he

 

became a writer, he describes the pas-sage to writing as the restoration, by a certain absence

 

and by a sort of calculated effacement, of presence disappointed of itself in speech. To write is

 

indeed the only way of keeping or recapturing speech since speech denies itself as it gives

 

itself. Thus an 

economy of signs is 

organized. It will be equally disappointing, closer yet to the

 

very essence and to the necessity of disappointment. One cannot help wishing to master

 

absence and yet we must always let go. Starobinski describes the profound law that

 

commands the space within which Rousseau must move:

How will he overcome the misunderstanding that prevents him from expressing himself

 

according to his true value? How escape the risks of improvised speech? To what other mode

 

of communication can he turn? By what other means mani-fest himself? Jean-Jacques chooses

 

to be 

absent 

and to 

write. 

Paradoxically, he will hide himself to show himself better, and he

 




will confide in written speech: “I would love society like others, if I were not sure of showing

 

myself not only at a disadvantage, but as completely different from what I am. The part that I

 

have taken of 

writing and hiding myself is 

precisely the one that suits me. If I were present,

 

one would never know what I was worth” 

(Confes

sions). The admission is singular and merits

 

emphasis: Jean-Jacques breaks with others, only to present himself to them in written speech.

 

Protected by solitude, he will turn and re-turn his sentences at leisure. 1

Let us note that the economy is perhaps indicated in the following: the operation that

 

substitutes writing for speech also replaces presence by value: to the 

I am 

or to the 

I am

 

present 

thus sacrificed, a 

what 

I am or a 

what I am worth is preferred. 

“If I were present, one

 

would never know what I was worth.” I renounce my present life, my present and concrete

 

existence in order to make myself known in the ideality of truth and value. A well-known

 

schema. The battle by which I wish to raise myself above my life even while I retain it, in

 

order to enjoy recognition, is in this case within myself, and writing is indeed the

 

phenomenon of this battle.

Such would be the writing lesson in Jean-Jacque’s existence. The act of writing would be

 

essentially—and here in an exemplary fashion—the great-

((143))

est sacrifice aiming at the greatest symbolic reappropriation of presence. From this point of

 

view, Rousseau knew that death is not the simple outside of life. Death by writing also

 

inaugurates life. “I can certainly say that I never began to live, until I looked upon myself as a

 

dead man” 

(Confessions, 

Book 6 [p. 236]). As soon as one determines it within the system of

 

this economy, is not the sacrifice—the “literary suicide”—dis

sipated in the 

appearance? 

Is it

 

anything but a symbolic reappropria

tion? Does it not renounce the 

present 

and the 

proper 

in

 

order to master them better in their meaning, in the ideal form of truth, of the presence of the

 

present and of the proximity or property of the proper? We would be obliged to decide that a

 

ruse and an appearance are necessary if in fact we were to abide by these concepts (sacrifice,

 

expenditure, renunciation, symbol, appearance, truth, etc.) which determine what we here call

 

econ

omy in terms of truth and appearance, starting from the opposition presence/absence.

But the work of writing and the economy of differance will not be domi

nated by this classical

 

conceptuality, this ontology, or this epistemology. On the contrary, these furnish its hidden

 

premises. Differance does not 

resist 

appropriation, it does not impose an exterior limit upon it.

 

Differance began by 

broaching 

alienation and it ends by leaving reappropriation 

breached.

 

Until death. Death is the movement of differance to the extent that that movement is

 

necessarily finite. This means that differance makes the opposition of presence and absence

 

possible. Without the possibility of differance, the desire of presence as such would not find

 

its breathing-space. That means by the same token that this desire carries in itself the destiny

 

of its non-satisfaction. Differance produces what it forbids, makes possible the very thing that

 

it makes impossible.

If differance is recognized as the obliterated origin of absence and presence, major forms of

 

the disappearing and the appearing of the entity, it would still remain to be known if being,

 

before its determination into absence or presence, is already implicated in the thought of

 

differance. And if differance as the project of the mastery of the entity should be under-stood

 

with reference to the sense of being. Can one not think the con-verse? Since the sense of

 

being is never produced as history outside of its determination as presence, has it not always

 




already been caught within the history of metaphysics as the epoch of presence? This is

 

perhaps what Nietzsche wanted to write and what resists the Heideggerian reading of

 

Nietzsche; 

differance 

in its 

active 

movement—what is comprehended in the concept of

 

differance 

without exhausting it—is what not only precedes metaphysics but also extends

 

beyond the thought of being. The latter speaks 

nothing other than 

metaphysics, even if it

 

exceeds it and thinks it as what it is within its closure.

((144))

From/Of Blindness to the Supplement

In terms of this problematical scheme, we must therefore think Rousseau’s experience and his

 

theory of writing together, the accord and the discord that, under the name of writing, relate

 

Jean-Jacques to Rous-seau, uniting and dividing his proper name. On the side of experience, a

 

recourse to literature as reappropriation of presence, that is to say, as we shall see, of Nature;

 

on the side of theory, an indictment against the negativity of the letter, in which must be read

 

the degeneracy of culture and the disruption of the community.

If indeed one wishes to surround it with the entire constellation of concepts that shares its

 

system, the word 

supplement 

seems to account for the strange unity of these two gestures.

In both cases, in fact, Rousseau considers writing as a dangerous means, a menacing aid, the

 

critical response to a situation of distress. When Nature, as self-proximity, comes to be

 

forbidden or interrupted, when speech fails to protect presence, writing becomes necessary. It

 

must 

be added 

to the word urgently. I have identified in advance one of the forms of this

 

addition; 

speech being natural or at least the natural expression of thought, the most natural

 

form of institution or convention for signifying thought, writing is added to it, is adjoined, as

 

an image or representation. In that sense, it is not natural. It diverts the immediate presence of

 

thought to speech into representation and the imagination. This recourse is not only “bizarre,”

 

but dangerous. It is the addition of a technique, a sort of artificial and artful ruse to make

 

speech present when it is actually absent. It is a violence done to the natural destiny of the

 

language:

Languages are made to be spoken, writing serves only as a supplement to speech. ... Speech

 

represents thought by conventional signs, and writing represents the same with regard to

 

speech. Thus the art of writing is nothing but a medi

ated representation of thought.

Writing is dangerous from the moment that representation there claims to be presence and the

 

sign of the thing itself. And there is a fatal necessity, inscribed in the very functioning of the

 

sign, that the substitute make one forget the vicariousness of its own function and make itself

 

pass for the plenitude of a speech whose deficiency and infirmity it nevertheless only

 

supplements. 

For the concept of the supplement—which here determines that of the

 

representative image—harbors within itself two significations whose cohabitation is as

 

strange as it is necessary. The supplement adds itself, it is a surplus, a plenitude enriching

 

another plenitude, the 

fullest measure 

of presence. It cumulates and accumulates presence. It

 

is thus that art, 

technè, 

image, representation, convention, etc., come as supplements to

((145))




nature and are rich with this entire cumulating function. This kind of supplementarity

 

determines in a certain way all the conceptual oppositions within which Rousseau inscribes

 

the notion of Nature to the extent that it 

should 

be self-sufficient.

But the supplement supplements. It adds only to replace. It intervenes or insinuates itself 

in-

the-place-of; 

if it fills, it is as if one fills a void. If it represents and makes an image, it is by

 

the anterior default of a presence. Compensatory 

[suppléant] 

and vicarious, the supplement is

 

an adjunct, a subaltern instance which 

takes-(the)-place [tient-lieu]. 

As substitute, it is not

 

simply added to the positivity of a presence, it produces no relief, its place is assigned in the

 

structure by the mark of an emptiness. Somewhere, something can be filled up 

of itself, 

can

 

accomplish itself, only by allowing itself to be filled through sign and proxy. The sign is

 

always the supplement of the thing itself.

This second signification of the supplement cannot be separated from the first. We shall

 

constantly have to confirm that both operate within Rous

seau’s texts. But the inflexion varies

 

from moment to moment. Each of the two significations is by turns effaced or becomes

 

discreetly vague in the presence of the other. But their common function is shown in this:

 

whether it adds or substitutes itself, the supplement is 

exterior, 

outside of the positivity to

 

which it is super-added, alien to that which, in order to be replaced by it, must be other than it.

 

Unlike the 

complement, 

dictionaries tell us, the supplement is an 

“exterior 

addition” (Robert’s

 

French Dic

tionary).

According to Rousseau, the negativity of evil will always have the form of supplementarity.

 

Evil is exterior to nature, to what is by nature innocent and good. It supervenes upon nature.

 

But always by way of compensation for 

[sous l

’

espèce de la suppléance] 

what 

ought to 

lack

 

nothing at all in itself.

Thus presence, always natural, which for Rousseau more than for others means maternal,

 

ought to be 

self-sufficient. Its 

essence, 

another name for presence, may be read through the

 

grid of this ought to be 

[ce conditionnel]. 

Like Nature’s love, “there is no substitute for a

 

mother’s love,” says 

Emile. 

2 It is in no way 

supplemented, 

that is to say it does not have to be

 

supplemented, it suffices and is self-sufficient; but that also means that it is irreplacable; what

 

one would substitute for it would not equal it, would be only a mediocre makeshift. Finally it

 

means that Nature does not supple-ment 

itself 

at all; Nature’s supplement does not proceed

 

from Nature, it is not only inferior to but other than Nature.

Yet all education, the keystone of Rousseauist thought, will be described or presented as a

 

system of substitution 

[suppléance] 

destined to recon

stitute Nature’s edifice in the most

 

natural way possible. The first chapter of 

Emile 

announces the function of this pedagogy.

 

Although there is no

((146))

substitute for a mother’s love, “it is better that the child should suck the breast of a healthy

 

nurse rather than of a petted mother, if he has any further evil to fear from her who has given

 

him birth” (ibid.) [p. 12]. It is indeed culture or cultivation that must supplement a deficient

 

nature, a deficiency that cannot by definition be anything but an accident and a deviation from

 

Nature. Culture or cultivation is here called habit; it is necessary and insufficient from the

 

moment when the substitution of mothers is no longer envisaged only “from the physiological

 

point of view”:




Other women, or even other animals, may give him the milk she denies him, but there is no

 

substitute for a mother’s love. The woman who nurses another’s child in place of her own is a

 

bad mother; how can she be a good nurse? She may become one in time; use [habit] will

 

overcome nature . . . (ibid.) .

Here the problems of natural right, of the relationship between Nature and Society, the

 

concepts of alienation, alterity, and corruption, are adapted most spontaneously to the

 

pedagogic problem of the substitution of mothers and children:

And this affection when developed has its drawbacks, which should make every sensible

 

woman, afraid to put her child out to nurse. Is she prepared to divide her mother’s rights, or

 

rather to abdicate them in favor of a stranger; to see her child loving another as much as and

 

more than herself . . . (ibid.) .

If, premeditating the theme of writing, I began by speaking of the sub

stitution of mothers, it is

 

because, as Rousseau will himself say, “more de-pends on this than you realize.”

How emphatically would I speak if it were not so hopeless to keep struggling in vain on

 

behalf of a real reform. More depends on this than you realize. Would you restore all men to

 

their primal duties, begin with the mothers; the results will surprise you. Every evil follows in

 

the train of this first sin; the whole moral order is disturbed, nature is quenched in every breast

 

. . . (p. 18) [p. 13].

Childhood is the first manifestation of the deficiency which, in Nature, calls for substitution

 

[suppléance]. 

Pedagogy illuminates perhaps more crudely the paradoxes of the supplement.

 

How is a natural weakness pos

sible? How can Nature ask for forces that it does not furnish?

 

How is a child possible in general?

First Maxim.—Far 

from being too strong, children are not strong enough for all the claims of

 

nature. Give them full use of such strength as they have and which they will not abuse.

 

Second 

Maxim.—Help them and supply what they lack, in intelligence or in strength,

 

whenever the need is of the body (p. 5o) [P. 35].

All the organization of, and all the time spent in, education will be regulated by this necessary

 

evil: “supply 

[suppléer] . . . 

[what] . . . is lacking”

((147))

and to replace Nature. It must be done as little and as late as possible. “One of the best rules

 

of good farming 

[culture] 

is to 

keep things back 

as much as possible” (p. 274) [p. 193]. “Give

 

nature time to work before you 

take over her business 

[act in her place—agir à 

sa {dace]” 

(p.

 

1oz; italics added) [p. 71].

Without childhood, no supplement would ever appear in Nature. The supplement is here both

 

humanity’s good fortune and the origin of its perversion. The health of the human race:

Plants are fashioned by cultivation, and men by education. If man were bom big and strong,

 

his size and strength would be useless to him until he had learned to use them; they would

 

create a prejudice against him, by not allowing others to think of assisting him; and, left to

 

himself, he would die miserably before knowing his needs. We complain of the state of

 




infancy; we do not see that, if man had not begun by being a child, the human race would

 

have perished (p. 67).

The threat of perversion:

While the Author of nature has given children the active principle, He takes care that it shall

 

do little harm by giving them small power to use it. But as soon as they can think of people as

 

tools that they are responsible for acti

vating, they use them to carry out their wishes and to

 

supplement 

their own weakness. This is how they become tiresome, masterful, imperious,

 

naughty, and unmanageable; a development which does not spring from a natural love of

 

power, but one which gives it to them, for it does not need much experience to realize how

 

pleasant it is to act through the hands of others and to move the world by simply moving the

 

tongue (p. 49; italics added) [p. 34].

The supplement will always be the moving of the tongue or acting through the hands of

 

others. In it everything is brought together: progress as the possibility of perversion,

 

regression toward an evil that is not natural and that adheres to the power of substitution that

 

permits us to asbent ourselves and act by proxy, through representation, through the hands of

 

others. Through the written 

[par écrit]. 

This substitution always has the form of the sign. The

 

scandal is that the sign, the image, or the representer, become forces and make “the world

 

move.”

This scandal is such, and its evil effects are sometimes so irreparable, that the world seems to

 

turn the wrong way (and we shall see later what such 

a catastrophe 

can signify for Rousseau);

 

then Nature becomes the supple-ment of art and society. It is the moment when evil seems

 

incurable: “As the child does not know how to be cured, let him know how to be ill. The one

 

art takes the place of 

[supplée] 

the other and is often more successful; it is the art of nature”

 

(p. 31) [p. zz]. It is also the moment when maternal nature, ceasing to be loved, as she ought

 

to be, for herself and in an im-mediate proximity (“O Nature! 0 my mother! behold me under

 

thy

((148))

protection alone! Here there is no cunning or knavish mortal to thrust him-self between me

 

and thee.” 

[Confession, 

Book 12] [p. 669]) becomes the substitute for another love and for

 

another attachment:

The contemplation of Nature always had a very great attraction for his heart; he found there a

 

supplement to the attachments that he needed; but he would have left the supplement for the

 

thing, if he had had the choice, and he was reduced to converse with the plants only after vain

 

efforts to converse with human beings 

(Dialogues, 

p. 794)

That botany becomes the supplement of society is more than a catastro

phe. It is the

 

catastrophe of the catastrophe. For in Nature, the plant is the most 

natural 

thing. It is natural

 

life. 

The mineral is distinguished from the vegetable in that it is a dead and useful Nature,

 

servile to man’s industry. When man has lost the sense and the taste of true natural riches—

plants

he rummages in the entrails of his mother and risks his health:

The Mineral Kingdom has nothing in itself either amiable or attractive; its riches, enclosed in

 

the breast [womb—sein] of the earth, seem to have been removed from the gaze of man in

 




order not to tempt his cupidity; they are there like a reserve to serve one day as 

a supplement

 

to the true wealth which is more within his grasp, and for which he loses taste according to the

 

extent of his cor

ruption. Then he is compelled to. call in industry, to struggle, and to labor to

 

alleviate his miseries; he searches the entrails of earth; he goes seeking to its center, at the risk

 

of his life and at the expense of his health, for imaginary goods in place of the real good

 

which the earth offers of herself if he knew how to enjoy it. 

He flies from the sun and the day,

 

which he is no longer worthy to see 3

Man has thus put out his eyes, he blinds himself by the desire to rum-mage in these entrails.

 

Here is the horrible spectacle of the punishment that follows the crime, in sum a simple

 

substitution:

He buries himself alive, and does well, not being worthy of living in the light of day. There

 

quarries, pits, forges, furnaces, a battery of anvils, hammers, smoke and fire, succeed to the

 

fair images of his rustic labors. The wan faces of the unhappy people who languish in the

 

poisonous vapors of mines, of black forgemen, of hideous cyclops, are the spectacle which the

 

working of the mine substitutes, in the heart [womb] of the earth for that of green fields and

 

flowers, the azure sky, amorous shepherds and robust laborers upon its surface . 4

Such is the scandal, such the catastrophe. The supplement is what neither Nature nor Reason

 

can tolerate. Neither Nature, our “common mother” 

(Reveries, p. 

îo66) [p. 143], nor the

 

reason which is reasonable, if not reasoning 

(De l’état de nature, [Pléiade, 

vol. 3], p. 478).

 

And had they not done everything to avoid this catastrophe, to protect themselves from this

 

violence and to guard and keep us from this fatal crime? “so

((149))

that,” says the second 

Discourse 

precisely of mines, “it looks as if nature had taken pains to

 

keep the fatal secret from us” (p. 172) [p. 200]. And let us not forget that the violence that

 

takes us toward the entrails of the earth, the moment of mine-blindness, that is, of metallurgy,

 

is the origin of society. For according to Rousseau, as we shall often confirm, agriculture,

 

marking the organization of civil society, assumes the beginning of metal

lurgy. Blindness thus

 

produces that which is born at the same time as society: the languages, the regulated

 

substitution of signs for things, the order of the supplement. One goes 

from blindness to the

 

supplement. 

But the blind person cannot see, in its origin, the very thing he produces to

 

supplement his sight. 

Blindness to the supplement is 

the law. And espe

cially blindness to its

 

concept. Moreover, it does not suffice to locate its functioning in order to 

see 

its meaning. The

 

supplement has no sense and is given to no intuition. We do not therefore make it emerge out

 

of its strange penumbra. We speak its reserve.

Reason is incapable of thinking this double infringement upon Nature: that there is 

lack 

in

 

Nature and that 

because of that very fact 

something 

is added 

to it. Yet one should not say that

 

Reason is 

powerless to think this; 

it is constituted by that lack of power. It is the principle of

 

identity. It is the thought of the self-identity of the natural being. It cannot even de-termine the

 

supplement as its other, as the irrational and the non-natural, for the supplement comes

 

naturally 

to put itself in Nature’s place. The sup

plement is the image and the representation of

 

Nature. The image is neither in nor out of Nature. The supplement is therefore equally

 

dangerous for Reason, the natural health of Reason.




Dangerous supplement. These are the words that Rousseau uses in the 

Confessions. 

He uses

 

them in a context which is only apparently different, and in order to explain, precisely, a

 

“condition almost unintelligible and inconceivable [to reason]”: “In a word, between myself

 

and the most passionate lover there was only one, but that an essential, point of dis

tinction,

 

which makes my condition almost unintelligible and inconceiv

able” 

(Pléiade, 

vol. 1, [p. 1]).

If we lend to the text below a paradigmatic value, it is only provisional and does not prejudge

 

what the discipline of a future reading might rigor

ously determine. No model of reading

 

seems to me at the moment ready to measure up to this text—which I would like to read as a

 

text 

and not as a document. Measure up to it fully and rigorously, that is, beyond what al-

ready makes the text most legible, and more legible than has been so far thought. My only

 

ambition will be to draw out of it a signification which that presumed future reading will not

 

be able to dispense with 

[faire économie]; 

the economy of a written text, circulating through

 

other texts, leading back to it constantly, conforming to the element of a language and to its

 

regulated functioning. For example, what unites the word “supple-

((150))

ment” to its concept was not invented by Rousseau and the originality of its functioning is

 

neither fully mastered by Rousseau nor simply imposed by history and the language, by the

 

history of the language. To speak of the writing of Rousseau is to try to recognize what

 

escapes these categories of passivity and activity, blindness and responsibility. And one

 

cannot abstract from the written text to rush to the signified it 

would mean, 

since the signified

 

is here the text itself. It is so little a matter of looking for a 

truth signified 

by these writings

 

(metaphysical or psychological truth: Jean-Jacque’s life behind his work) that if the texts that

 

interest us 

mean 

some-thing, it is the engagement and the appurtenance that encompass

 

existence and writing in the same 

tissue, 

the same 

text. 

The same is here called sup

plement,

 

another name for differance.

Here is the irruption of the dangerous supplement in Nature, between nature and nature,

 

between natural innocence as 

virginity 

and natural inno

cence as 

pucelage *: 

“In a word,

 

between myself and the most passionate lover there was only one, but that an essential, point

 

of distinction, which makes my condition almost unintelligible and inconceivable.” Here, the

 

lineation should not hide the fact that the following paragraph is destined to explain the “only

 

one point of distinction” and the “almost unintelligible and inconceivable” “condition.”

 

Rousseau elaborates:

I had returned from Italy not quite the same as I had entered it, but as, perhaps, no one of my

 

age had ever returned from it. I had brought back, not my virginity but my 

pucelage. I 

had felt

 

the progress of years; my restless temper

atment had at last made itself felt, and its first

 

outbreak, quite involuntary, had caused me alarm about my health in a manner which shows

 

better than anything else the innocence in which I had lived up to that time. Soon reassured, I

 

learned that dangerous means of assisting it 

[ce dangereux supplément], 

which cheats Nature

 

and saves up for young men of my temperment many forms of excess at the expense of their

 

health, strength, and, sometimes, their life 

(Pléiade, I, 

pp. 108—09 [p. iii].

We read in 

Emile 

(Book IV) : “If once he acquires this dangerous habit 

[supplément] 

he is

 

ruined” [p. 299]. In the same book, it is also a question of “mak[ing] up . . . by trading on . . .

 

inexperience” 

[suppléer en gagnant de vitesse sur l’experience; 

literally “supplementing by

 




out-distancing ex

perience”] (p. 437) [p. 315], and of the “mind, which reinforces 

[supplée] ...

 

the bodily strength” (p. 183) [p. 129].

The experience of auto-eroticism is lived in anguish. Masturbation re-assures (“soon

 

reassured”) only through that culpability traditionally at

tached to the practice, obliging

 

children to assume the fault and to

xxx fotnote start xxx

•

“

Pucelage” is 

the more earthy French word for the actual physical fact of sexual

 

intactness, in the female the membrane itself. Rousseau applies the word to his own case with

 

some derision, contrasting it to the spiritual innocence of true “virginity.”

xxx fotntoe slutt xxx

((151))

interiorize the threat of castration that always accompanies it. Pleasure is thus lived as the

 

irremediable loss of the vital substance, as exposure to madness and death. It is produced “at

 

the expense of their health, strength, and, sometimes, their life.” In the same way, the

 

Reveries 

will say, the man who “searches the entrails of earth . . . goes seeking to its center, at

 

the risk of his life and at the expense of his health, for imaginary goods in place of the real

 

good which the earth offers of herself if he knew how to enjoy it.” 

(Pléiade, 

vol. 1, îo67 [p.

 

145])

And indeed it is a question of the imaginary. The supplement that “cheats” maternal “nature”

 

operates as writing, and as writing it is dan

gerous to life. This danger is that of the image. Just

 

as writing opens the crisis of the living speech in terms of its “image,” its painting or its

 

representation, so onanism announces the ruin of vitality in terms of imaginary seductions:

This vice, which shame and timidity find so convenient, possesses, besides a great attraction

 

for lively imaginations—that of being able to dispose of the whole sex as they desire, and to

 

make the beauty which tempts them minister to their pleasures, without being obliged to

 

obtain its consent 

[Confessions, 

p. 111].

The dangerous supplement, which Rousseau also calls a “fatal ad-vantage,” is properly

 

seductive; 

it leads desire away from the good path, makes it err far from natural ways, guides

 

it toward its loss or fall and therefore it is a sort of lapse or scandal 

(scandalon) . 

It thus

 

destroys Nature. But the scandal of Reason is that nothing seems more natural than this

 

destruction of Nature. It is myself who exerts myself to separate myself from the force that

 

Nature has entrusted to me: “Seduced by this fatal advantage, I did my best to destroy the

 

good constitution which Nature had restored to me, and [to] which I had allowed time to

 

strengthen itself.” We know what importance 

Emile 

gives to time, to the slow maturation of

 

natural forces. The entire art of pedagogy is a calculated patience, allowing the work of

 

Nature time to come to fruition, respecting its rhythm and the order of its stages. The

 

dangerous supplement destroys very quickly the forces that Nature has slowly constituted and

 

accumulated. In “out-distancing” natural experience, it runs non-stop 

[brûle les étapes—

literally “burns the halting-points”] and consumes energy without possi

bility of recovery. As I

 

shall confirm, like the sign it bypasses the presence of the thing and the duration of being.




The dangerous supplement breaks with Nature. The entire description of this moving away

 

from Nature has 

a scene [thédtre]. 

The 

Confessions 

stage the evocation of the dangerous

 

supplement at the moment when it is a question of making visible a distancing which is

 

neither the same nor an other; Nature draws away at the same time as the Mother, or rather

((152))

“

Mamma,” who already signified the disappearance of the true mother and has substituted

 

herself in the well-known ambiguous manner. It is therefore now a question of the distance

 

between Mamma and the person she called “Little one.” 5 As 

Emile 

says, all evil comes from

 

the fact that “women have ceased to be mothers, they do not and will not return to their duty”

 

(p. 18) [p. 14]. A certain absence, then, of a certain sort of mother. And the experience of

 

which we speak is such as to reduce that absence as much as to maintain it. 

A furtive

 

experience, that of a thief who needs invisibility: that the mother be invisible and not see.

 

These lines are often quoted:

I should never have done, if I were to enter into the details of all the follies which the

 

remembrance of this dear mamma caused me to commit when I was no longer in her

 

presence. How often have I kissed my bed, since she had slept in it; my curtains, all the

 

furniture of my room, since they belonged to her, and her beautiful hand had touched them;

 

even the floor, on which I prostrated myself, since she had walked upon it! Sometimes, even

 

in her presence, I was guilty of extravagances, which only the most violent love seemed

 

capable of inspiring. At table one day, just when she had put a piece of food into her mouth, I

 

exclaimed that I saw a hair in it; she put back the morsel on her plate, and I eagerly seized and

 

swallowed it. 6 In a word, between myself and the most passionate lover there was only one,

 

but that an essential, point of distinction, which makes my condition almost unintelligible and

 

inconceivable ... [A little above, we read] I only felt the full strength of my attachment when I

 

no longer saw her (p. rod) [pp. rio–ir]

The Chain of Supplements

The discovery of the dangerous supplement will be next cited 

among 

these “follies,” but it

 

will still retain a privilege; Rousseau evokes it after the others and as a sort of explanation of

 

the state inconceivable to reason. For it is not the question of diverting total enjoyment toward

 

a particular substitute, but now of experiencing it or miming it 

directly and in its totality. 

It is

 

no longer a question of kissing the bed, the floor, the curtains, the furniture, etc., not even of

 

“swallowing” the “piece . . . [that] she had put into her mouth,” but of “dispos[ing] of the

 

whole sex as . . . [one] desire[s].”

I remarked that the stage of this theater was not only a setting in the generally understood

 

sense: an ensemble of accessories. The topographic disposition of the experience is not

 

unimportant. Jean-Jacques is in the house of Madame de Warens; close enough to 

Mamma 

to

 

see her and to nourish his imagination upon her but with the possibility of a partition. It is at

 

the moment when the mother disappears that substitution becomes

((153))

possible and necessary. The play of maternal presence or absence, this alteration of perception

 

and imagination must correspond to an organiza

tion of space; the text argues as follows:




Add to this habit the circumstances of my position, living as I was with a beautiful woman,

 

caressing her image in the bottom of my heart, seeing her con

tinually throughout the day,

 

surrounded in the evening by objects which reminded me of her, sleeping in the bed in which

 

I knew she had slept! What causes for excitement! Many a reader, who reflects upon them, no

 

doubt al-ready considers me as half-dead! Quite the contrary; that which ought to have

 

destroyed me was just the thing that saved me, at least for a time. Intoxicated with the charm

 

of living with her, with the ardent desire of spending my life with her, I always saw in her,

 

whether she were absent or present, a tender mother, a beloved sister, a delightful friend, and

 

nothing more. . . . She was for me the only woman in the world; and the extreme sweetness of

 

the feelings with which she inspired me did not allow my senses time to awake for others, and

 

protected me against her and all her sex.

This experience was not an event marking an archaic or adolescent period. Not only did it

 

construct or sustain a particular hidden foundation, an edifice of significations. It remained an

 

active obsession whose “present” is constantly reactivated and constituted in its turn, until the

 

end of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s “life” and “text.” A little later, a little further on in the text of

 

the 

Confessions 

(Book IV), 7 “a little incident, which I find some difficulty in relating,” [p.

 

150] is related to us. The encounter with a man “addicted to the same vice.” Terrified, Jean-

Jacques runs away, “trembling as if” he had just “committed a crime.” “The recollection of

 

this incident cured me of it for a long time” [p. 151].

For a long time? Rousseau will never stop having recourse to, and ac

cusing himself of, this

 

onanism that permits one to be himself affected by providing himself with presences, by

 

summoning absent beauties. In his eyes it will remain the model of vice and perversion.

 

Affecting oneself by another presence, one 

corrupts 

oneself [makes oneself other] by oneself

 

[on s’altère soi-même]. 

Rousseau neither wishes to think nor can think that this alteration

 

does not simply happen to the self, that it is the self’s very origin. He must consider it a

 

contingent evil coming from without to affect the integrity of the subject. But he cannot give

 

up what immediately restores to him the other desired presence; no more than one can give up

 

language. This is why, in this respect as well, as he says in the 

Dialogues [Pléiade, vol. 

1] (p.

 

Soo), “to the end of his life he will remain an aged child.”

The restitution of presence by language, restitution at the same time symbolic and immediate.

 

This contradiction must be thought. Immediate experience of restitution because as

 

experience, as consciousness or con-

((154))

science, 

it dispenses with passage through the world. 

What is touching is touched, auto-

affection gives itself as pure autarchy. If the presence that it then gives itself is the substitutive

 

symbol of another presence, it has never been possible to desire that presence “in person”

 

before this play of substitution and this symbolic experience of auto-affection. The thing itself

 

does not appear outside of the symbolic system that does not exist without the possibility of

 

auto-affection. Experience of 

immediate 

restitution, also because it 

does not wait. 

It is

 

satisfied then and there and in the moment. If it waits, it is not because the other makes it

 

wait. Pleasure seems no longer to be deferred. “Why give oneself so much trouble in a hope

 

remote from so poor and uncertain a success, when one can, from the very instant . . .”

 

(Dialogues) .




But what is no longer deferred is also absolutely deferred. The presence that is thus delivered

 

to us in the present is a chimera. Auto-affection is a pure speculation. The sign, the image, the

 

representation, which come to supplement the absent presence are the illusions that sidetrack

 

us. To culpability, to the anguish of death and castration, is added or rather is assimilated the

 

experience of frustration. 

Donner le change 

[”sidetracking” or, “giving money”): in whatever

 

sense it is understood, this expression describes the recourse to the supplement admirably. In

 

order to explain his “dislike” for “common prostitutes,” Rousseau tells us that in Venice, at

 

thirty-one, the “propensity which had modified all my passions” 

(Confes

sions, p. 

41) [p. 35] 8

 

has not disappeared: “I had not lost the pernicious habit of satisfying my wants 

[donner le

 

change]” 

(p. 316) [p. 289].

The enjoyment of the 

thing itself is 

thus undermined, in its act and in its essence, by

 

frustration. One cannot therefore say that it has an essence or an act 

(eidos, ousia, energeia,

 

etc.). Something promises itself as it escapes, gives itself as it moves away, and strictly

 

speaking it cannot even be called presence. Such is the constraint of the supplement, such,

 

exceeding all the language of metaphysics, is this structure “almost inconceivable to reason.”

 

Almost 

inconceivable: simple irrationality, the opposite of reason, are less irritating and

 

waylaying for classical logic. The supplement is maddening because it is neither presence nor

 

absence and because it con

sequently breaches both our pleasure and our virginity. “. . .

 

abstinence and enjoyment, pleasure and wisdom, escaped me in equal measure” 

(Confes

sions,

 

p. 12).

Are things not complicated enough? The symbolic is the immediate, presence is absence, the

 

nondeferred is deferred, pleasure is the menace of death. But one stroke must still be added to

 

this system, to this strange economy of the supplement. In a certain way, it was already

 

legible. A terrifying menace, the supplement is also the first and surest protection; against that

 

very menace. This is why it cannot be given up. And sexual auto-affection, that is auto-

affection in general, neither begins nor ends with

((155))

what one thinks can be circumscribed by the name of masturbation. The supplement has not

 

only the power of 

procuring 

an absent presence through its image; procuring it for us through

 

the proxy 

[procuration] 

of the sign, it holds it at a distance and masters it. For this presence is

 

at the same time desired and feared. The supplement transgresses and at the same time re

-

spects the interdict. This is what also permits writing as the supplement of speech; but already

 

also the spoken word as writing in general. Its economy exposes and protects us at the same

 

time according to the play of forces and of the differences of forces. Thus, the supplement is

 

dangerous in that it threatens us with death, but Rousseau thinks that it is not at all as

 

dangerous as “cohabitation with women.” Pleasure 

itself, 

without symbol or suppletory, that

 

which would accord us (to) pure presence itself, if such a thing were possible, would be only

 

another name for death. Rousseau says it:

Enjoyment! Is such a thing made for man? Ah! If I had ever in my life tasted the delights of

 

love even once in their plenitude, I do not imagine that my frail existence would have been

 

sufficient for them, I would have been dead in the act 

(Confessions, 

Book VIII).

If one abides by the universal evidence, by the necessary and a priori value of this proposition

 

in the form of a sigh, one must immediately recognize that “cohabitation with women,”

 

hetero-eroticism, can be lived (effectively, really, as one believes it can be said) only through

 




the ability to reserve within itself its own supplementary protection. In other words, be

tween

 

auto-eroticism and hetero-eroticism, there is not a frontier but an economic distribution. It is

 

within this general rule that the differences are mapped out. This is Rousseau’s general rule.

 

And before trying—what I do not pretend to be doing here—to encompass the pure

 

singularity of Rous

seau’s economy or his writing, we must carefully raise and articulate be

-

tween them all the structural or essential necessities on their different levels of generality.

It is from a certain determined representation of “cohabitation with women” that Rousseau

 

had to have recourse throughout his life to that type of dangerous supplement that is called

 

masturbation and that cannot be separated from his activity as a writer. To the end. Thérèse—

the Thérèse of whom we can speak, Thérèse in the text, whose name and “life” belong to the

 

writing we read—experienced it at her cost. In Book XII of the 

Con-fessions, 

at the moment

 

when “I must speak without reserve,” the “two reasons combined” of certain “resolutions” is

 

confided to us:

I mutt speak without reserve. I have never concealed either my poor mamma’s faults or my

 

own. I must not show greater favor to Thérèse either; and, pleased as I am to render honor to

 

one who is so dear to me, neither do I wish to conceal her faults, if so be that an involuntary

 

change in the heart’s affections is

((156))

really a fault. I had long since observed that her affection for me had cooled... . I was

 

conscious again of an unpleasantness, the effects of which I had formerly felt when with

 

mamma; and the effect was the same with Thérèse. Let us not look for perfections which are

 

not to be found in nature; it would be the same with any other woman whatsoever. . . . My

 

situation, however, was at that time the same, and even aggravated by the animosity of my

 

enemies, who only sought to find me at fault. I was afraid of a repetition; and, not desiring to

 

run the risk of it, I preferred to condemn myself to strict continence, than to expose Thérèse to

 

the risk of finding herself in the same condition again. Besides, I had observed that

 

intercourse with women distinctly aggravated my ill-health. ... These two reasons combined

 

caused me to form resolutions which I had sometimes been very inconsistent in keeping, but

 

in which I had persevered with greater firmness for the last three or four years (p. 595) [pp.

 

616-17].

In the 

Manuscrit de Paris, 

after “distinctly aggravated my ill-health!” we read: “the

 

corresponding vice, of which I have never been able to cure myself completely, appeared to

 

me to produce less injurious results. These two reasons combined ...” 9

This perversion consists of preferring the sign and protects me from mortal expenditure. To be

 

sure. But this apparently egotistical economy also functions within an entire system of moral

 

representation. Egotism is redeemed by a culpability, which determines auto-eroticism as a

 

fatal waste and a wounding of the self by the self. But as I thus harm only myself, this

 

perversion is not truly condemnable. Rousseau explains it in more than one letter. Thus: “With

 

that exception and [the exception of] vices that have always done harm to me alone, I can

 

expose to all eyes a life irreproachable in all the secrets of my heart” (to M. de Saint-Germain,

 

2—26-7o). “I have great vices, but they have never harmed anyone but me” (to M. Le Noir, 1

—15—72) . 10




Jean-Jacques could thus look for a supplement to Thérèse only on one condition: that the

 

system of supplementarity in general be already open in its possibility, that the play of

 

substitutions be already operative for a long time and that 

in a certain way Thérèse herself be

 

already a supple-ment. As 

Mamma was already the supplement of an unknown mother, and as

 

the “true mother” herself, at whom the known “psychoanalyses” of the case of Jean-Jacques

 

Rousseau stop, was also in a certain way a supplement, from the first trace, and even if she

 

had not “truly” died in giving birth. Here is the chain of supplements. The name Mamma

 

already designates one:

Ah, my Thérèse! I am only too happy to possess you, modest and healthy, and not to find

 

what I never looked for. [The question is of “maidenhood” 

[pucelage] 

which Thérèse has just

 

confessed to have lost in innocence and by accident.] At first I had only sought amusement; I

 

now saw that I had found more and gained a companion. A little intimacy with this excellent

 

girl, a little

((157))

reflection upon my situation, made me feel that, while thinking only of my pleasures, I had

 

done much to promote my happiness. To 

supply the place of 

my extinguished ambition, I

 

needed a lively sentiment which should 

take complete possession of 

[literally “fill”—remplit]

 

my heart. In a word, I needed a successor to mamma. As I should never live with her again, I

 

wanted some-one to live with her pupil, in whom I might find the simplicity and docility of

 

heart which she had found in me. I felt it neecssary that the gentle tranquillity of private and

 

domestic life 

should make up 

to me for the loss of the brilliant career which I was renouncing.

 

When I was quite alone, I felt a void in my heart, which it only needed another heart to 

fill.

 

Destiny had deprived me of, or, at least in part, alienated me from, that heart for which Nature

 

had formed me. From that moment I was alone; for’ 

with me it has always been everything or

 

nothing. I found in Thérèse the substitute [supplément] that I needed 

11

Through this sequence of supplements a necessity is announced: that of an infinite chain,

 

ineluctably multiplying the supplementary mediations that produce the sense of the very thing

 

they defer: the mirage of the thing itself, of immediate presence, of originary perception.

 

Immediacy is derived. That all begins through the intermediary is what is indeed “in-

conceivable [to reason].”

The Exorbitant. Question of Method

“

For me there has never been an intermediary between everything or nothing.” The

 

intermediary is the mid-point and the mediation, the middle term between total absence and

 

the absolute plenitude of presence. It is clear that mediacy is the name of all that Rousseau

 

wanted opinionatedly to efface. This wish is expressed in a deliberate, sharp, thematic way. It

 

does not have to be deciphered. Jean-Jacques recalls it here at the very moment when he is

 

spelling out the supplements that are linked together to replace a mother or a Nature. And here

 

the supplement occupies the middle point between total absence and total presence. The play

 

of substitution fills and marks a determined lack. But Rousseau argues as if the recourse to the

 

supplement—here to Thérèse—was going to appease his impatience when confronted with

 

the intermediary: “From that moment I was alone; for me there has never been an

 

intermediary between everything and nothing. I found in Thérèse the substitute that I needed.”

 

The virulence of this concept is thus appeased, as if one were able to 

arrest it, 

domesticate it,

 

tame it.




This brings up the question of the usage of the word “supplement”: of Rousseau’s situation

 

within the language and the logic that assures to this word or this concept sufficiently

 

surprising 

resources so that the presumed subject of the sentence might always say, through

 

using the “supplement,”

((158))

more, less, or something other than what he 

would mean [voudrait dire]. 

This question is

 

therefore not only of Rousseau’s writing but also of our reading. We should begin by taking

 

rigorous account of this 

being held within [prise] 

or this 

surprise: 

the writer writes 

in a

 

language and 

in 

a logic whose proper system, laws, and life his discourse by definition cannot

 

domi

nate absolutely. He uses them only by letting himself, after a fashion and up to a point,

 

be governed by the system. And the reading must always aim at a certain relationship,

 

unperceived by the writer, between what he com

mands and what he does not command of the

 

patterns of the language that he uses. This relationship is not a certain quantitative distribution

 

of shadow and light, of weakness or of force, but a signifying structure that critical reading

 

should 

produce.

What does produce mean here? In my attempt to explain that, I would initiate a justification of

 

my principles of reading. A justification, as we shall see, entirely negative, outlining by

 

exclusion a space of reading that I shall not fill here: a task of reading.

To produce this signifying structure obviously cannot consist of repro

ducing, by the effaced

 

and respectful doubling of commentary, the con

scious, voluntary, intentional relationship that

 

the writer institutes in his exchanges with the history to which he belongs thanks to the

 

element of language. This moment of doubling commentary should no doubt have its place in

 

a critical reading. To recognize and respect all its classical exigencies is not easy and requires

 

all the instruments of traditional criti

cism. Without this recognition and this respect, critical

 

production would risk developing in any direction at all and authorize itself to say almost

 

anything. But this indispensable guardrail has always only 

protected, 

it has never 

opened, 

a

 

reading.

Yet if reading must not be content with doubling the text, it cannot legitimately transgress the

 

text toward something other than it, toward a referent (a reality that is metaphysical,

 

historical, psychobiographical, etc.) or toward a signified outside the text whose content could

 

take place, could have taken place outside of language, that is to say, in the sense that we give

 

here to that word, outside of writing in general. That is why the meth

odological

 

considerations that we risk applying here to an example are closely dependent on general

 

propositions that we have elaborated above; as regards the absence of the referent or the

 

transcendental signified. 

There is nothing outside of the text 

[there is no outside-text; 

it n’y a

 

pas de hors-texte]. 

And that is neither because Jean-Jacques’ life, or the existence of Mamma

 

or Thérèse 

themselves, is 

not of prime interest to us, nor because we have access to their so-

called “real” existence only in the text and we have neither any means of altering this, nor any

 

right to neglect this limita

tion. All reasons of this type would already be sufficient, to be sure,

 

but there are more radical reasons. What we have tried to show by’ following

((159))

the guiding line of the “dangerous supplement,” is that in what one calls the real life of these

 

existences “of flesh and bone,” beyond and behind what one believes can be circumscribed as

 




Rousseau’s text, there has never been anything but writing; there have never been anything

 

but supple

ments, substitutive significations which could only come forth in a chain of

 

differential references, the “real” supervening, and being added only while taking on meaning

 

from a trace and from an invocation of the supple-ment, etc. And thus to infinity, for we have

 

read, 

in the text, 

that the ab-solute present, Nature, that which words like “real mother” name,

 

have always already escaped, have never existed; that what opens meaning and language is

 

writing as the disappearance of natural presence.

Although it is not commentary, our reading must be intrinsic and re-main within the text. That

 

is why, in spite of certain appearances, the locating of the word 

supplement is 

here not at all

 

psychoanalytical, if by that we understand an interpretation that takes us outside of the writing

 

toward a psychobiographical signified, or even toward a general psycho-logical structure that

 

could rightly be separated from the signifier. This method has occasionally been opposed to

 

the traditional doubling com

mentary; it could be shown that it actually comes to terms with it

 

quite easily. 

The security with which the commentary considers the self-identity of the text, the

 

confidence with which it carves out its contour, goes hand in hand with the tranquil assurance

 

that leaps over the text toward its presumed content, in the direction of the pure signified. 

And

 

in effect, in Rousseau’s case, psychoanalytical studies like those of Dr. Laforgue trans-gress

 

the text only after having read it according to the most current methods. The reading of the

 

literary “symptom” is most banal, most aca

demic, most naive. And once one has thus blinded

 

oneself to the very tissue of the “symptom,” to its proper texture, one cheerfully exceeds it

 

toward a psychobiographical signified whose link with the literary signifier then be-comes

 

perfectly extrinsic and contingent. One recognizes the other aspect of the same gesture when,

 

in general works on Rousseau, in a package of classical shape that gives itself out to be a

 

synthesis that faithfully re-stores, through commentary and compilation of themes, the totality

 

of the work and the thought, one encounters a chapter of biographical and psychoanalytical

 

cast on the “problem of sexuality in Rousseau,” with a reference in an Appendix to the

 

author’s medical case-history.

If it seems to us in principle impossible to separate, through interpreta

tion or commentary, the

 

signified from the signifier, and thus to destroy writing by the writing that is yet reading, we

 

nevertheless believe that this impossibility is historically articulated. It does not limit attempts

 

at deciphering in the same way, to the same degree, and according to the same rules. Here we

 

must take into account the history of the text in general. When we speak of the writer and of

 

the encompassing power of the lan-

((160))

guage to which he is subject, we are not only thinking of the writer in literature. The

 

philosopher, the chronicler, the theoretician in general, and at the limit everyone writing, is

 

thus taken by surprise. But, in each case, the person writing is inscribed in a determined

 

textual system. Even if there is never a pure signified, there are different relationships as to

 

that which, from the signifier, 

is presented 

as the irreducible stratum of the signified. For

 

example, the philosophical text, although it is in fact always written, includes, precisely as its

 

philosophical specificity, the project of effacing itself in the face of the signified content

 

which it transports and in general teaches. Reading should be aware of this project, even if, in

 

the last analysis, it intends to expose the project’s failure. The entire history of texts, and

 

within it the history of literary forms in the West, should be studied from this point of view.

 

With the exception of a thrust or a point of resistance which has only been very lately

 

recognized as such, literary writing has, almost always and almost everywhere, according to

 




some fashions and across very diverse ages, lent itself to this 

transcendent 

reading, in that

 

search for the signified which we here put in question, not to annull it but to understand it

 

within a system to which such a reading is blind. Philo

sophical literature is only one example

 

within this history but it is among the most significant. And it interests us particularly in

 

Rousseau’s case. Who at the same time and for profound reasons produced a philosophical

 

literature to which belong 

The Social Contract 

and 

La nouvelle Héloise, 

and chose to live by

 

literary writing; by a writing which would not be ex

hausted by the message—philosophical or

 

otherwise—which it could, so to speak, deliver. And what Rousseau has said, as philosopher

 

or as psycholo

gist, of writing in general, cannot be separated from the system of his own

 

writing. We should be aware of this.

This poses formidable problems. Problems of outlining in particular. Let me give three

 

examples.

I. If the course I have followed in the reading of the “supplement” is not merely

 

psychoanalytical, it is undoubtedly because the habitual psy

choanalysis of literature begins by

 

putting the literary signifier as such within parentheses. It is no doubt also because

 

psychoanalytic theory itself is for me a collection of texts belonging to my history and my

 

culture. To that extent, if it marks my reading and the writing of my interpretation, it does not

 

do so as a principle or a truth that one could abstract from the textual system that I inhabit in

 

order to illuminate it with complete neutrality. In a certain way, I am 

within 

the history of

 

psychoanalysis as I am 

within 

Rousseau’s text. Just as Rousseau drew upon a language that

 

was already there—and which is found to be somewhat our own, thus assuring us a certain

 

minimal readability of French literature—in the same way we operate today within a certain

 

network of significations marked by psycho-

((161))

analytic theory, even if we do not master it and even if we are assured of never being able to

 

master it perfectly.

But it is for another reason that this is not even a somewhat inarticulate psychoanalysis of

 

Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Such a psychoanalysis is already obliged to have located all the

 

structures of appurtenance within Rousseau’s text, all that is not unique to it—by reason of the

 

encompassing power and the already-thereness of the language or of the culture—all that

 

could be in

habited rather than produced by writing. Around the irreducible point of originality

 

of this writing an immense series of structures, of historical totalities of all orders, are

 

organized, enveloped, and blended. Supposing that psychoanalysis can by rights succeed in

 

outlining them and their interpretations, supposing that it takes into account the entire history

 

of metaphysics—the history of that Western metaphysics that entertains rela

tionships of

 

cohabitation with Rousseau’s text, it would still be necessary for this psychoanalysis to

 

elucidate the law of its own appurtenance to meta-physics and Western culture. Let us not

 

pursue this any further. We have already measured the difficulty of the task and the element of

 

frustration in our interpretation of the supplement. We are sure that something irreducibly

 




Rousseauist is captured there but we have carried off, at the same time, a yet quite unformed

 

mass of roots, soil, and sediments of all sorts.

2.Even supposing that Rousseau’s text can be rigorously isolated and articulated within

 

history in general, and then within the history of the sign “supplement,” one must still take

 

into consideration many other possibilities. Following the appearances of the word

 

“supplement” and of the corresponding concept or concepts, we traverse a certain path within

 

Rousseau’s text. To be sure, this particular path will assure us the economy of a synopsis. But

 

are other paths not possible? And as long as the totality of paths is not effectively exhausted,

 

how shall we justify this one?

3.In Rousseau’s text, after having indicated—by anticipation and as a prelude—the function

 

of the sign “supplement,” I now prepare myself to give special privilege, in a manner that

 

some might consider exorbitant, to certain texts like the 

Essay on the Origin of Languages

 

and other fragments on the theory of language and writing. By what right? And why these

 

short texts, published for the most part after the author’s death, difficult to classify, of

 

uncertain date and inspiration?

To all these questions and within the logic of their system, there is no satisfying response. In a

 

certain measure and in spite of the theoretical pre-cautions that I formulate, my choice is in

 

fact 

exorbitant.

But what is the exorbitant?

I wished to reach the point of a certain exteriority in relation to the totality of the age of

 

logocentrism. Starting from this point of exteriority,

((162))

a certain deconstruction of that totality which is also a traced path, of that orb 

(orbis) 

which is

 

also orbitary 

(orbita), 

might be broached. The first gesture of this departure and this

 

deconstruction, although subject to a cer

tain historical necessity, cannot be given

 

methodological or logical intra

orbitary assurances. Within the closure, one can only judge its

 

style in terms of the accepted oppositions. It may be said that this style is empiricist and in a

 

certain way that would be correct. The 

departure is 

radically empiricist. It proceeds like a

 

wandering thought on the possi

bility of itinerary and of method. It is affected by

 

nonknowledge as by its future and it 

ventures out 

deliberately. I have myself defined the form

 

and the vulnerability of this empiricism. But here the very concept of empiri

cism destroys

 

itself. To 

exceed 

the metaphysical orb is an attempt to get out of the orbit 

(orbita), 

to think the

 

entirety of the classical conceptual oppositions, particularly the one within which the value of

 

empiricism is held: the opposition of philosophy and nonphilosophy, another name for

 

empiricism, for this incapability to sustain on one’s own and to the limit the coherence of

 

one’s own discourse, for being produced as truth at the moment when the value of truth is

 

shattered, for escaping the internal contradictions of skepticism, etc. 

The thought of this

 

historical opposition between philosophy and empiricism is not simply empirical and it

 

cannot be thus qualified without abuse and misunderstanding.




Let us make the diagram more specific. What is exorbitant in the read-ing of Rousseau? No

 

doubt Rousseau, as I have already suggested, has only a very relative privilege in the history

 

that interests us. If we merely wished to situate him within this history, the attention that we

 

accord him would be clearly disproportionate. But that is not our intention. We wish to

 

identify a decisive articulation of the logocentric epoch. For purposes of this identification

 

Rousseau seems to us to be most revealing. That obvi

ously supposes that we have already

 

prepared the exit, determined the repression of writing as the fundamental operation of the

 

epoch, read a certain number of texts but not all of them, a certain number of Rous

seau’s texts

 

but not all of them. This avowal of empiricism can sustain itself only by the strength of the

 

question. The opening of the question, the de

parture from the closure of a self-evidence, the

 

putting into doubt of a system of oppositions, all these movements necessarily have the form

 

of empiricism and of errancy. At any rate, they cannot be described, 

as to past norms, 

except

 

in this form. No other trace is available, and as these errant questions are not absolute

 

beginnings in every way, they allow themselves to be effectively reached, on one entire

 

surface, by this description which is also a criticism. We must begin 

wherever we are 

and the

 

thought of the trace, which cannot not take the scent into account, has already taught us that it

 

was impossible to justify a point of departure absolutely. 

Wherever we are: 

in a text where we

 

already believe ourselves to be.

((163))

Let us narrow the arguments down further. In certain respects, the theme of supplementarity is

 

certainly no more than one theme among others. It is in a chain, carried by it. Perhaps one

 

could substitute some-thing else for it. 

But it happens that this theme describes the chain

 

itself, the being-chain 

of 

a textual chain, the structure of substitution, the articu

lation of

 

desire and of language, the logic of all conceptual oppositions taken over by 

Rousseau, and

 

particularly the role and the function, in his system, of the concept of Nature. It tells us in a

 

text what a text is, it tells us in writing what writing it, in Rousseau’s writing it tells us Jean-

Jacque’s desire, etc. If we consider, according to the axial proposition of this essay, that there

 

is nothing outside the text, our ultimate justification would be the following: the concept of

 

the supplement and the theory of writing designate textuality itself in Rousseau’s text in an

 

indefinitely multi-plied structure—en 

abyme [in an 

abyss]—to employ the current phrase.

 

And we shall see that this abyss is not a happy or unhappy accident. An entire theory of the

 

structural necessity of the abyss will be gradually constituted in our reading; the indefinite

 

process of supplementarity has always already 

infiltrated 

presence, always already inscribed

 

there the space of repetition and the splitting of the self. Representation 

in the abyss 

of

 

presence is not an accident of presence; the desire of presence is, on the contrary, born from

 

the abyss (the indefinite multiplication) of repre

sentation, from the representation of

 

representation, etc. The supplement itself is quite exorbitant, in every sense of the word.

Thus Rousseau inscribes textuality in the text. But its operation is not simple. It tricks with a

 

gesture of effacement, and strategic relations like the relationships of force among the two

 

movements form a complex design. This design seems to us to be represented in the handling

 

of the concept of the supplement. Rousseau cannot utilize it at the same time in all the

 

virtualities of its meaning. The way in which he determines the concept and, in so doing, lets

 

himself be determined by that very thing that he excludes from it, the direction in which he

 




bends it, here as addition, there as substitute, now as the positivity and exteriority of evil, now

 

as a happy auxiliary, all this conveys neither a passivity nor an activity, neither an

 

unconsciousness nor a lucidity on the part of the author. Read-ing should not only abandon

 

these categories—which are also, let us recall in passing, the founding categories of

 

metaphysics—but should produce the law of this relationship to the concept of the

 

supplement. It it certainly a production, because I do not simply duplicate what Rousseau

 

thought of this relationship. The concept of the supplement is a sort of blind spot in

 

Rousseau’s text, the not-seen that opens and limits visibility. But the production, if it attempts

 

to make the not-seen accessible to sight, does not leave the text. It has moreover only believed

 

it was doing so by illusion. It is contained in the transformation of the language it

((164))

designates, in the regulated exchanges between Rousseau and history. We know that these

 

exchanges only take place by way of the language and the text, in the infrastructural sense that

 

we now give to that word. And what we call production is necessarily a text, the system of a

 

writing and of a reading which we know is ordered around its own blind spot. We know this a

 

priori, but only now and with a knowledge that is not a knowledge at all.

((165))

3. Genesis and Structure of the 

Essay on the Origin of

 

Languages

I. The Place of the “Essay”

What about the voice within the logic of the supplement? within that which should perhaps be

 

called the “graphic” of the supplement?

Within the chain of supplements, it was difficult to separate writing from onanism. Those two

 

supplements have in common at least the fact that they are dangerous. They transgress a

 

prohibition and are ex

perienced within culpability. But, by the economy of differance, they

 

con-firm the interdict they transgress, get around a danger, and reserve an ex

penditure. In

 

spite of them but also thanks to them, we are authorized to see the sun, to deserve the light

 

that keeps us on the surface of the mine.

What culpability attaches to these two experiences? What fundamental culpability is found

 

fixed or deflected there? These questions may be elab-orated in their proper place only if we

 




first describe the structural and “phenomenological” superficies of these two experiences,

 

especially the area they have in common.

In both cases, the possibility of auto-affection manifests itself as such: it leaves a trace of

 

itself in the world. The worldly residence of a signifier becomes impregnable. That which is

 

written remains, and the experience of touching-touched admits the world as a third party. The

 

exteriority of space is irreducible there. Within the general structure of auto-affection, within

 

the giving-oneself-a-presence or a pleasure, the operation of touching-touched receives the

 

other within the narrow gulf that separates doing from suffering. And the outside, the exposed

 

surface of the body, signifies and marks forever the division that shapes auto-affection.

Auto-affection is a universal structure of experience. All living things are capable of auto-

affection. And only a being capable of symbolizing, that is to say of auto-affecting, may let

 

itself be affected by the other in general. Auto-affection is the condition of an experience in

 

general. This possibility —another name for “life”—is a general structure articulated by the

 

history of life, and leading to complex and hierarchical operations. Auto-affection,

((166))

the as-for-itself or for-itself—subjectivity—gains in power and in its mas-tery of the other to

 

the extent that its power of repetition 

idealizes itself. 

Here idealization is the movement by

 

which sensory exteriority, that which affects me or serves me as signifier, submits itself to my

 

power of repetition, to what thenceforward appears to me as my spontaneity and escapes me

 

less and less.

One must understand speech in terms of this diagram. Its system re-quires that it be heard and

 

understood immediately by whoever emits it. It produces a signifier which seems not to fall

 

into the world, outside the ideality of the signified, but to remain sheltered—even at the

 

moment that it attains the audiophonic system of the other—within the pure interiority of

 

auto-affection. It does not fall into the exteriority of space, into what one calls the world,

 

which is nothing but the outside of speech. Within so-called “living” speech, the spatial

 

exteriority of the signifier seems absolutely reduced. 1 It is in the context of this possibility

 

that one must pose the problem of the cry—of that which one has always excluded, pushing it

 

into the area of animality or of madness, like the myth of the inarticulate cry—and the

 

problem of speech (voice) within the history of life.

Conversation is, then, a communication between two absolute origins that, if one may venture

 

the formula, auto-affect reciprocally, repeating as immediate echo the auto-affection produced

 

by the other. Immediacy is here the myth of consciousness. Speech and the consciousness of

 

speech—that is to say consciousness simply as self-presence—are the phenomenon of an

 

auto-affection lived as suppression of differance. That 

phenomenon, 

that presumed

 

suppression of differance, that lived reduction of the opacity of the signifier, are the origin of

 

what is called presence. That which is not subjected to the process of differance is 

present.

 

The present is that from which we believe we are able to think time, effacing the inverse

 

necessity: to think the present from time as differance.




This very formal structure is implied by all analyses of the investments of the system of

 

orality and of the audiophonic system in general, however rich and diverse the field might be.

From the moment that nonpresence comes to be felt within speech itself —and there is at least

 

a foreboding of it from the very threshold of articula

tion and diacriticity—writing is somehow

 

fissured in its value. On the one hand, as we have seen, it is the effort of symbolically

 

reappropriating presence. On the other, it consecrates the dispossession that had already

 

dislocated the spoken word. In both senses, one may say that in one way or another, it had

 

already begun to undermine and shape “living” speech, exposing it to the death within the

 

sign. But the supplementary sign does not expose to death by affecting a self-presence that is

 

already possible. Auto-affection constitutes the same 

(auto) 

as it divides the same. Privation

 

of presence is the condition of experience, that is to say of presence.

((167))

In as much as it 

puts into play 

the presence of the present and the life of the living, the

 

movement of language does not, one suspects, have only an analogical relationship with

 

“sexual” auto-affection. It is totally indis

tinguishable from it, even if that totality is severely

 

articulated and differ

entiated. The logocentric longing par excellence is to distinguish one

 

from the other. Its last resort would be to dissolve sexuality within the trans

cendental

 

generality of the structure “touching-touched,” as a certain phenomenology might describe it.

 

That dissociation is the very one by which one wishes to distinguish speech from writing. In

 

the same way that the “fatal advantage” of sexual auto-affection begins well before what is

 

thought to be circumscribed by the name of masturbation (organization of so-called wrong

 

and pathological gestures, confined to some children or adolescents), the supplementary

 

menace of writing is older than what some think to exalt by the name of “speech.”

From then on, metaphysics consists of excluding non-presence by de

termining the supplement

 

as 

simple exteriority, 

pure addition or pure absence. The work of exclusion operates within the

 

structure of supple

mentarity. The paradox is that one annuls addition by considering it a pure

 

addition. 

What is added is nothing because it is added to a full presence to which it is exterior.

 

Speech comes to be added to intuitive presence (of the entity, of 

essence, 

of the 

eidos, 

of

 

ousia, 

and so forth); writing comes to be added to living self-present speech; masturbation

 

comes to be added to so-called normal sexual experience; culture to nature, evil to innocence,

 

history to origin, and so on.

The concept of origin or nature is nothing but the myth of addition, of supplementarity

 

annulled by being purely additive. It is the myth of the effacement of the trace, that is to say

 

of an originary differance that is neither absence nor presence, neither negative nor positive.

 

Originary dif

ferance is supplementarity as 

structure. 

Here structure means the irreduci

ble

 

complexity within which one can only shape or shift the play of presence or absence: that

 

within which metaphysics can be produced but which metaphysics cannot think.

This movement of the effacement of the trace has been, from Plato to Rousseau to Hegel,

 

imposed upon writing in the narrow sense; the neces

sity of such a displacement may now be

 

apparent. Writing is one of the representatives of the trace in general, it is not the trace itself.

 




The trace itself does not exist. (To 

exist is to be, to be an entity, a being-present, 

to on.) 

In a

 

way, this displacement leaves the place of the decision hidden, but it also indicates it

 

unmistakably.

Writing, Political Evil, and Linguistic Evil.

 

Desire desires the exteriority of presence and

 

nonpresence. This exterority is a matrix. Among all its representations (exteriority of nature

 

and its others, of good and of evil, of

((168))

innocence and perversity, of consciousness and nonconsciousness, of life and death, etc.), one

 

in particular requires our special notice. It will intro-duce us to 

The Essay on the Origin of

 

Languages. 

It is the exterioirty of mastery and servitude or of liberty and nonliberty. Among

 

all these repre

sentations, the exteriority of liberty and nonliberty is perhaps privileged. More

 

clearly than others, it brings together the historical (political, eco

nomic, technological) and the

 

metaphysical. Heidegger has summarized the history of metaphysics by repeating that which

 

made of liberty the condition of presence, that is to say, of truth. 2 And speech always pre

-

sents itself as the best expression of liberty. It is by itself language at liberty and the liberty of

 

language, the freedom of a speech which need not borrow its signifiers from the exteriority of

 

the world, and which there-fore seems incapable of being dispossessed. Do the most

 

imprisoned and deprived beings not make use of that interior spontaneity which is speech?

 

What is true of the citizen is in the first place true of those naked beings exposed to the power

 

of others: the newborn. “Your first gifts are fetters, your first treatment, torture. 

Their voice

 

alone is free; 

why should they not raise it in complaint?” 

(Emile, 

p. 

15 

[p. 11]; italics added).

The Essay on the Origin of Languages 

opposes speech to writing as presence to absence and

 

liberty to servitude. These are almost the final words of the 

Essay: 

“But I say that any tongue

 

with which one cannot make oneself understood to the people assembled is a slavish tongue.

 

It is impossible for a people to remain free and speak that tongue” (Chap. XX). With this

 

sentence, through the detour of the Lévi-Straussian ideology of the “neighborhood,” of a

 

“small community where everybody knew every-body else” and where nobody went beyond

 

earshot we have set foot again upon a Rousseauist ground that we had hardly left: a classical

 

ideology according to which writing takes the status of a tragic fatality come to prey upon

 

natural innocence, interrupting the golden age of the present and full speech.

Rousseau concludes thus:

These superficial reflections, which hopefully might give birth to more profound ones, I shall

 

conclude with the passage that suggested them to me:

“

To observe in fact and to show by examples, the degree to which the char

acter, customs and

 

interests of a people influence their language, would provide material for a sufficiently

 

philosophical investigation.” (Remarks on a General and Reasoned Grammar, 

by M. Duclos,

 

p. 

2 

[pp. 73–74] )




In fact, the 

Commentary 3 

of Duclos, with the 

Essai sur l’origine des con-naissances

 

humaines* 

of Condillac (1746), seems to have been one of the

((169))

major “sources” of 

The Essay on the Origin of Languages. 

One might even be tempted to

 

consider Rousseau’s 

Essay 

as the accomplishment of the “philsophic” program charted by

 

Duclos. The latter regrets

the penchant we have of making our language soft, effeminate and monotonous. We have

 

reason to avoid roughness in pronunciation, but I think we go too far into the opposite fault.

 

Formerly we pronounced many more diphthongs than we do today; in the tenses, as J’avois

 

[jhavwa], j’aurois [jhorwa], and in many nouns, such as François [Franswa], Anglois

 

[Anglwa], Polonois [Polonwa], whereas today we say j’avais [jhavay], Fransay, Anglay,

 

Polonay. Those diph

thongs, however, gave force and variety to pronunciation, and saved it

 

from a monotony that partly arises from our multitude of mute e-s. 

4

The degradation of the language is the symptom of a social and political degradation (a theme

 

that will become most frequent in the second half of the eighteenth century); it has its origins

 

in the aristocracy and in the capital city. Duclos announces the Rousseauist themes most pre

-

cisely when he holds forth thus: “What we call 

society, 

and what our ancestors would merely

 

have called 

a coterie, 

decides the nature of language and manners 

[moeurs] 

today. When a

 

word has been for a time in use 

in these social circles, 

its pronunciation softens.” 5 Duclos

 

finds equally intol

erable similar multilations inflicted upon words, their corruptions, and

 

above all their abridgements; one must on no account 

shorten [couper] 

words:

This nonchalance in pronunciation, which is not incompatible with an im-patience in

 

expression, makes us corrupt even the nature of words, by chopping them up in such a way

 

that the meaning is no longer recognizable. Today, for example, one pronounces the proverb

 

as, in spite of him and his teeth 

[ses dens], 

rather than in spite of him and his helpers 

[ses

 

aidans]. 

We have more of these words shortened or corrupted by usage than one would credit.

 

Our language will become imperceptibly more proper for conversations than for the tribune,

 

and conversation sets the tone for the Chair, the Bar, and for the Theater; whereas with the

 

Greeks and Romans, the tribune did not submit to it. A sustained pronunciation and a fixed

 

and distinct prosody must be maintained in particular by peoples who are obliged to treat

 

publicly matters that are of interest to all the auditors, for, other things being equal, an orator

 

whose pronunciation is firm and varied would be understood at a greater distance than another

 

.. .




Deterioration in the language and in pronounciation is thus inseparable from political

 

corruption. The political model that inspires Duclos is Athe

nian or Roman democracy. The

 

language is the property of the people. Each derives its unity from the other. For if language

 

has a body and a system, they inhere in the people assembled and “bodily” united: “It is a

 

people in a body that makes a language.... A people is thus the absolute master of the

((170))

spoken 

language, and it is an empire they possess unawares.” 6 To dispossess the people of

 

their mastery of the language and thus of their self-mastery, one must suspend the 

spoken

 

element in language. Writing is the very proceess of the dispersal of peoples unified as bodies

 

and the beginning of their enslavement: “The body of a nation alone has authority over the

 

spoken language, 

and the writers have the right over the 

written 

language: 

The people, Varro

 

said, are not masters of writing as they are of speech” 

(p. 

420).

This unity of political and linguistic evil calls for a “philosophical examination.” Rousseau

 

already responds to this appeal by means of the 

Essay. 

But we shall, very much later,

 

recognize Duclos’s problematics in a much sharper form. The difficulty of the pedagogy of

 

language and of the teaching of foreign languages is, 

Emile 

will say, that one cannot sepa

rate

 

the signifier from the signified, and, changing words, one changes ideas in such a way that the

 

teaching of a language transmits at the same time an entire national culture over which the

 

pedagogue has no control, which resists him like the already-there preceding the formation,

 

the institution preceding instruction.

You will be surprised to find that I reckon the study of languages among the useless lumber of

 

education. . . . If the study of languages were merely the study of words, that is, of the

 

symbols by which language expresses itself, then this might be a suitable study for children;

 

but languages, as they change the symbols, also modify the ideas which the symbols express.

 

Minds are formed by language, thoughts take their color from its ideas. Reason alone is

 

common to all. Every language has its own form, a difference which may be partly cause and

 

partly effect of difference in national character; this conjecture appears to be confirmed by the

 

fact that in every nation under the sun speech follows the changes of manners, and is

 

preserved or altered along with them (p. 105 [P

.

 

73]).

And this entire theory of the teaching of languages rests on rigorous dis

tinctions separating

 

thing, meaning (or idea), and sign; today we would speak of the referent, the signified, and the

 

signifier. If the representer may have an effect, sometimes pernicious, on the represented, and

 

if the child must not and cannot “learn to speak more than one language,” it is that “each thing

 

may have a thousand different signs for him; but each idea may have only one form” (ibid.)

Launched by Duclos, the invitation to the “philosophic examination” occupied Rousseau for a

 

long time. In 1754 it had been formulated in the 

Commentary. 

It is cited at the conclusion of

 

the 

Essay; 

elsewhere other pas-sages of the 

Commentary 

are evoked, notably in Chapter VII.

 

Do these citations, which could not have been anterior to the publication of the second

 

Discourse (Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality Among Men), 

also dated

 

1754, lead us to some certainty about the date




((171))

of the composition of the 

Essay? 

And to what extent can one connect this chronological

 

problem with the systematic problem of what is called the author’s thought? The importance

 

that we assign to this work compels us to consider the question.

On the date of the composition of this little known and posthumously published text, the most

 

authoritative interpreters and historians rarely agree. And when they do, it is generally for

 

different reasons. The ultimate question at stake within this problem is evident: can one speak

 

of this as a work of maturity? does its content accord with the second 

Discourse 

and the later

 

works?

In this debate, external arguments always mingle with internal ones. The debate has continued

 

for more than seventy years and has gone through two phases. If we begin by remembering

 

the most recent, it is primarily because it has developed a little as if the first phase had not

 

brought the external aspect of the problem to what I would consider to be a definite

 

conclusion. But it is also because, in a certain way, it has re

newed the form of the internal

 

problem.

The Present Debate: The Economy of Pity.

 

The passages cited from Duclos are not the sole

 

indications that allow modern commentators to conclude that the 

Essay 

comes after the

 

second 

Discourse 

or that it is at the most its contemporary. B. Gagnebin and M. Raymond

 

recall in their edi

tion of the 

Confessions 7 

that “the 

Essay on the Origin of Languages

 

appeared for the first time in a volume of 

Treatises on Music 

by J.-J. Rous-seau which De

 

Peyrou published in Geneva in 1781, based on the manu-script which he possessed and which

 

he bequeathed to the Library of Neuchâtel (No. 7835).” The editors of the 

Confessions 

draw

 

attention to “this most remarkable little work, too little read” and use the citations from

 

Duclos as evidence for placing it after the second 

Discourse. 

“In short,” they add, “the very

 

material of the 

Essay 

presupposes a knowledge and a maturity of thought that Rousseau had

 

not acquired in 1750.” This is also the opinion of R. Derathé, 8 at least on Chapter IX and X,

 

which are among the most important and which, explaining the “Formation of the Languages

 

of the South” and the “Formation of the Languages of the North,” develop the themes most

 

akin to those of the second 

Discourse.

Is it not plausible—and tempting to imagine—that Rousseau might have spread out the

 

composition of this text over many years? Can one not isolate in it many strata of his

 

reflections? Could the passages from Duclos not have been introduced later? Could certain of

 

the important chapters not have been composed, completed, or revised at the same time as the

 

second 

Discourse 

or even after? That would reconcile the interpretations and would give a

 

certain authority to the hypothesis of those who now place the conception, if not the entire

 

execution, of the 

Essay 

well before




((172))

1754. Thus Vaughan thinks, for external reasons, that the Essay was planned before the

 

second 

Discourse, 

and even before the first 

Discourse 

(1750). 9 Indeed it relates very closely

 

to the writings on music. Its full title says it well: Essay on 

the Origin of Languages, which

 

treats of Melody, 

and 

Musical Imitation. 

It is known that the writings on music follow from a

 

very precocious inspiration. 

In 1742 Rousseau read at the Academy of Sciences his 

Projet

 

concernant les nouveaux signes pour la musique. 

In 1743 the 

Dissertation sur la musique

 

moderne 

appeared. In 1749, year of the composition of the first 

Discourse, 

Rousseau wrote, at

 

D’Alembert’s behest, the articles on music for the 

Encyclopaedia. 

It is in the context of these

 

articles that he will write the 

Dictionnaire de musique * 

to which the 

Essay 

was joined at the

 

time of its first publication. Can one not imagine that the 

Essay 

was projected at this time,

 

even if its execution stretched out over many years, Rousseau modifying till 1754 certain

 

intentions and certain chapters until he thought to make of the 

Essay, 

as he says in a

 

“Preface,” 10 a piece of the second 

Discourse?

However, in spite of the convenience and plausibility of this reconciling conjecture, there is

 

one point at which, for internal and systematic reasons, it is difficult to get rid of the

 

disagreement by assigning a period and a part of the truth to each hypothesis. Here one must

 

choose sides.

The moment comes with respect to the philosophical content of Chapter IX, “Formation of the

 

Southern Languages.” It is over the subject of this fundamental chapter that Derathé and

 

Starobinski differ. To be sure, they are never directly opposed on this point. But both give a

 

note 11 to it, and their confrontation may illuminate our problem.

That the essay was an intended part of the second 

Discourse 

is, accord-ing to Derathé, “the

 

most plausible hypothesis, at least with respect to Chapters IX and X . . . which show the

 

same preoccupations as 

The Dis-course on Inequality.”

Now, it is precisely in Chapter IX that Starobinski locates an affirma

tion which seems

 

incompatible to him with the intention of the second 

Discourse. 

From it he concludes that

 

Rousseau’s thought had evolved. And it could only have evolved from the Essay to the

 

Discourse, 

since the doc

trine will seemingly no longer vary on this point after 1754. Thus,

 

syste

matically and historically, the 

Essay 

is anterior to the second 

Discourse. 

And that would

 

appear from an examination of the status given by him to that fundamental sentiment which

 

according to him is 

pity. 

Briefly, the 

Discourse 

makes of it a 

natural 

feeling or virtue, coming

 

before the use of reflection, while in the Essay, Rousseau seems to think that it is previ

ously

 

aroused [éveillée]—let 

us conserve all the indeterminacy of the word for the moment—by

 

judgment.

((173))

Since it gives rise to no disagreement, let us first recall the doctrine of the 

Discourse.

 

Rousseau affirms there unambiguously that pity is more primitive than the work of reason and

 

reflection. That is a condition of its universality. And the argument could not help but aim at

 

Hobbes:

I think I need not fear contradiction in holding man to be possessed of the only 

natural 

virtue,

 

which could not be denied him by the most violent detractor of human virtue 12 I am

 

speaking of compassion 

[pitié], 

which is a disposition suitable to creatures so weak and

 

subject to so many evils as we certainly are: by so much the more universal and useful to

 

mankind, 

as it comes before any kind of reflection; 

and at the same time so natural, that the

 

very brutes them-selves sometimes give evident proofs of it.

And after giving examples of it within the human and the animal order, but referring almost

 

always to the mother-child relationship, Rousseau continues:

Such is the pure emotion of nature, 

prior to all kinds of reflection! Such 

is the force of natural

 

compassion 

[la pitié naturelle], 

which the greatest depravity of morals has as yet hardly been

 

able to destroy! . . . Mandeville well knew that, in spite of all their morality, men would have

 

never been better than monsters, had not nature bestowed on them a sense of compassion

 

[pitié], 

to aid their reason. ... It is then certain that compassion 

[pitié] 

is a natural feeling,

 

which, by moderating the violence of love of self in each individual, contributes to the

 

preservation of the whole species. It is this compassion 

[pitié] 

that hurries us 

without

 

reflection 

to the relief of those who are in distress: it is this which in a state of nature 

supplies

 

the place 

of laws, morals, and virtues, with the ad-vantage that none are tempted to disobey its

 

gentle voice [pp. 

183-84]. 13

Let us pause before we take up the thread of the debate. Let us recon

sider the system of

 

metaphors. Natural pity, which is illustrated archetypi

cally by the relationship between mother

 

and child, and generally by the relationship between life and death, commands like a gentle

 

voice. In the metaphor of that soft voice the presence of the mother as well as of Nature is at

 

once brought in. That the soft voice must be the mother’s as well as Nature’s is clear from the

 

fact that it is, as the metaphor of the voice clearly always indicates in Rousseau, a law. “No

 

one is tempted to disobey it” at the same time because it is soft and because, being natural,

 

and absolutely original, it is also inexorable. That matemal law is a voice. Pity is a voice. As

 

opposed to writing, which is 

without pity, 

the voice is always, in its essence, the passage of

 

virtue and good passion. The order of pity “takes the place of law,” it supplements law, that is

 

to say instituted law. But as institutional law is also the supplement of natural law when the

 

latter is lacking, it is clear that only the concept of the supplement allows us to think the

 

relationship between nature and law here. These two terms have no meaning except within the

 

structure of supplementarity. The au-

((174))




thority of nonmaternal law has no sense except as it is substituted for the authority of natural

 

law, for the “gentle voice” which it was clearly neces

sary to be “tempted to disobey.” The

 

order without pity to which one accedes when the gentle voice stops making itself heard, is it

 

quite simply, as we let it be imagined a moment ago, the order of writing? Yes and no. Yes, to

 

the extent that writing is read literally, or is tied to the letter 

[on lit écriture d la lettre, ou on

 

la lie å la lettre]. 

No, as long as writing is under-stood in its metaphor. One might then say

 

that the natural law, the gentle voice of pity, is not only uttered by a maternal solicitude, it is

 

inscribed in our hearts by God. It concerns the natural writing, the writing of the heart, which

 

Rousseau opposes to the writing of reason. Only the latter is with-out pity, it alone

 

transgresses the interdict that, under the name of natural affection, links the child to the

 

mother and protects life from death. To transgress the law and the voice of pity is to replace

 

natural affection by perverse passion. The first is good because it is inscribed in our hearts by

 

God. It is here that we encounter that divine or natural writing whose metaphoric

 

displacement we have already situated. In 

Emile, 

describing what he calls the “second birth,”

 

Rousseau will write:

Our passions are the chief means of self-preservation; to try to destroy them is therefore as

 

absurd as it is useless; this would be to overcome nature, to re-shape God’s handiwork. If God

 

bade man annihilate the passions he has given him, He would and would not do so; He would

 

contradict himself. He has never given such a foolish commandment, there is nothing like it

 

written on the heart of man, and what God will have a man do, He does not leave to the words

 

of another man, He speaks Himself; His words are written in the secret heart (pp. 246-47) [p.

 

173].

The absolutely primitive passion, which God may not ask us to deny without contradicting

 

Himself, is the love of self 

[l’amour de soi]. 

It is well-known that Rousseau distinguishes it

 

from that self-love 

[l’amour-propre] 

which is its corrupt form. Now, if the source of all

 

passions is natural, all the passions are not so. “A thousand strange channels have swollen it”

 

(ibid.) . ‘What concerns us here about the status of pity, the root of the love of others, is that it

 

is neither the source itself, nor a secondary stream of passion, one acquired passion among

 

others. It is 

the first diversion 

of the love of self. It is 

almost 

primitive, and it is in the

 

difference between absolute proximity and absolute identity that all the problematics of pity

 

are lodged. “The child’s first sentiment is love of self 

[l’amour de soi]; 

and his second, which

 

is derived from it, is love of those about him” (p. 248) [p. 174]. That diversion/derivation is

 

next demonstrated: it is less an estrangement and an interruption of the love of self than its

 

first and most necessary conse

quence. If pity moderates “the violence 

[l’activité] 

of love of

 

self” (second 

Discourse, 

p. 

156) 

[p. 

184], 

it is perhaps less by opposing itself to it 14 than

((175))

by expressing it in an indirect way, by defering it, since such moderation “contributes to the

 

preservation of the whole species” (ibid.).

It must further be understood how and why pity, itself supplanted by law and society, may

 

also play the role of that which supplants. Why at a given time or all the time does it take the

 

place of culture, being that which “in a state of nature supplies the place of laws, morals, and

 




virtues?” 

[Discourse, 

p. 184]. Against what analogue of itself, against what depravity does it

 

guard us, which resembles and yet differs from it enough so that a substitu

tion may take

 

place?

Is it by chance that, like many another supplement, the natural and prereflexive sentiment of

 

pity, which “contributes to the preservation of the whole species,” protects us from, among

 

other deadly menaces, love? Is it by chance that pity protects man 

(homo) 

from destruction

 

through the fury of love, to the extent that it protects man 

(vir) 

from his destruc

tion through

 

the fury of woman? What God’s inscription means is that pity—which ties the child to the

 

mother and life to nature—must pro

tect us from the amorous passion which ties the child’s

 

becoming-man (the “second birth”) to the mother’s becoming-woman. That becoming is the

 

great substitution. Pity protects the humanity of man, and the life of the living, to the extent

 

that it saves, as we shall go on to see, the virility of man and the masculinity of the male.

In fact, if pity is natural, if that which brings us to identify with others is an innate movement,

 

love or the amorous passion is, on the contrary, not natural at all. It is a product of history and

 

society.

Of the passions that stir the heart of man, there is one which makes the sexes necessary to

 

each other, and is extremely ardent and impetuous; a terrible passion that braves danger,

 

surmounts all obstacles, and in its transports seems calculated to bring destruction on the

 

human race which it is really destined to preserve. What must become of men who are left to

 

this brutal and boundless rage, without modesty, without shame, and daily upholding their

 

amours at the price of their blood? 

(Discourse, p. 

157) 

[p. 185]

Under this bloody picture one must read, as in a palimpsest, 

the other scene: 

that which, a

 

moment ago and in the same colors, exhibited a world of dead horses, ferocious animals, and

 

children torn from the mother’s breast.

The amorous passion is thus the perversion of natural pity. Unlike the latter, it limits our

 

attachment to a single person. As always in Rousseau, evil here has the form of determination,

 

of comparison and of 

preference. 

That is to say of difference. This invention of culture

 

denatures pity, de

flects its spontaneous movement, which would carry it instinctively and

 

indistinctly toward everything living, whatever may be its species and sex. Jealousy, which

 

marks the gap between pity and love, is not only a creation

((176))

of culture in our society. As a ruse of comparison, it is a stratagem of femi

ninity, an arresting

 

of nature by woman. What is cultural and historical in love is at the service of femininity:

 

made to enslave man to woman. It is “a factitious sentiment; born of social usage, super-

subtly celebrated by women, with care for the establishment of their empire, and rendering

 

dominant the sex that ought to obey” (p. 158). 

Emile 

will say that “the law of nature bids the

 

woman obey the man” (p. 517) [p. 370]. And Rousseau describes here the battle between man

 

and woman according to the pattern and in the very terms of the Hegelian dialectic of master

 

and slave, which illuminates not only his text but also 

The Phenomenology of the Mind:




If he takes a wife from a lower class, natural and civil law are in accordance and all goes well.

 

When he marries a woman of higher rank it is just the opposite case; the man must choose

 

between diminished rights or imperfect gratitude; he must be ungrateful or despised. Then the

 

wife, laying claim to authority, makes herself a tyrant over her lawful head; and the master,

 

who has become a slave, is the most ridiculous and miserable of creatures. Such are the

 

unhappy favorites whom the sovereigns of Asia honor and torment with their alliance; people

 

tell us that if they desire to sleep with their wife they must enter by the foot of the bed (ibid.).

The historical perversion15 is introduced through a double substitution: substitution of a

 

political command for domestic government, and of moral for physical love. It is natural that

 

the woman govern the home and Rous-seau recognizes her “natural talent” for it; but she must

 

do it under the husband’s authority, “as a minister reigns in the State, by contriving to be

 

ordered to do what she wants”:

I expect that many of my readers will remember that I think women have a natural gift for

 

managing men, and will accuse me of contradicting myself; yet they are mistaken. There is a

 

vast difference between claiming the right to command, and managing him who commands.

 

Women’s reign is a reign of 

gentleness, 

tact, and kindness; 

her commands are caresses, 

her

 

threats are tears. She should reign in the home as a minister reigns in the state, by contriving

 

to be ordered to do what she wants. In this sense, I grant you, that the best managed homes are

 

those where the wife has most power. But when she despises the 

voice 

of her head, when she

 

desires to usurp his rights and take the command upon herself, this inversion of the proper

 

order of things leads only to misery, scandal, and dishonor (ibid.; italics added) .

In modern society, then, order has been reversed by woman and that is the very form of

 

usurpation. That substitution is not one abuse among others. It is the paradigm of violence and

 

political anomaly. Like the

((177))

linguistic evil of which we spoke above—and we shall soon see the two directly linked—that

 

substitution is a political evil. The 

Letter to M. d’Alembert 

says it well:

... and, no longer wishing to tolerate separation, unable to make themselves into men, the

 

women make us into women. This disadvantageous result which degrades man is very

 

important everywhere; but it is especially so in states like ours, whose interest it is to prevent

 

it. Whether a monarch governs men or women ought to be rather indifferent to him, provided

 

that he be obeyed; but in a republic, men are needed. 16

The morality of this proposition is that women themselves would gain if the republic restored

 

the natural order, for in a perverse society man scorns the woman he must obey: “Cowardly

 

devoted to the will of the sex that we ought to protect rather than serve, we have learnt to

 

scorn them while we obey, to outrage them by our railing concern.” And Paris, guilty of the

 

degradations of language, is again incriminated: “And each Parisian woman in her apartment

 

assembles a seraglio of men more feminine than herself, who know how to render all kinds of

 

homage to beauty, except for that of the heart which she deserves” (ibid.).




The “natural” image of woman, as Rousseau reconstitutes it, emerges slowly: exalted by man

 

but submissive to him, she must govern without being mistress. One must 

respect 

her, that is

 

to say love her, from a suf

ficient distance so that the forces—our own and those of the body

 

politic —are not breached through it. For we risk our 

constitution 

not only by “cohabiting

 

with women” (instead of containing them within domestic government) but also by regulating

 

our society according to theirs. “They [men] are affected as much as and more than, women

 

by commerce that is too intimate: they lose only their morals, but we lose our morals and our

 

constitution” (p. 204) [p. ioo]. The contest is not equal; perhaps that is the most profound

 

signification of the play of supplementarity.

This takes us directly to the other form of substitutive perversion: that which adds moral to

 

physical love. There is a naturalness in love: it serves procreation and the conservation of the

 

species. That which Rousseau calls “the physicalness of Love” is, as its name indicates,

 

natural, and thus joined to the movement of pity. Desire is not pity, to be sure, but, according

 

to Rousseau, it is prereflexive like pity. Now one must “distinguish . . . be

tween what is moral

 

and what is physical in the passion called love” (second 

Discourse, p. 

157) [p. 196]. Within

 

the “moral” that substitutes itself for the natural, within the institution, history, and culture,

 

female perfidy, thanks to social usage, works to arrest natural desire in order to capture its

 

energy so that it may be directed to a single person. It thus makes sure of an usurping of

 

control:

((178))

The physical part of love is that general desire which urges the sexes to union with each other.

 

The moral part is that which determines and fixes this desird exclusively upon one particular

 

object; or at least gives it a greater degree of energy toward the object thus preferred.

 

(Discourse, 

pp. 157–58) [p. 186]

The operation of femininity—and that femininity, the feminine princi

ple, may be at work

 

among women just as much as among those whom society calls men and whom, Rousseau

 

says, “women turn to women”—consists therefore in capturing energy to attach it to a single

 

theme, a sole representation.

Such is the history of love. In it is reflected nothing but history as denaturalization: that which

 

adds itself to nature, the moral supplement, displaces the force of nature by substitution. In

 

that sense the supplement is nothing, it has no energy of its own, no spontaneous movement.

 

It is a parasitic organism, an imagination or representation which determines and orients the

 

force of desire. One can never explain, in terms of nature and natural force, the fact that

 

something like the difference of a 

preference 

might, without any force of its own, force force.

 

Such an inexplicability gives all its style and all its form to Rousseau’s thought.

This pattern is already an interpretation of history by Rousseau. But this interpretation lends

 

itself in its turn to a second interpretation where we notice a certain hesitation. Rousseau

 

seems to oscillate between two readings of this history. And the sense of that oscillation

 

should be recog

nized here. It will illuminate our analysis yet further. Sometimes the per-verse

 

substitution is described as the origin of history, as historicity itself and the first deviation

 




with respect to natural desire. Sometimes it is de-scribed as an historical depravity 

within

 

history, not just a corruption within the form of supplementarity but a supplementary

 

corruption. It is thus that one may read descriptions of an historical society within which

 

woman takes her place, remains in her place, occupies her natural place, as an object of

 

uncorrupted love:

The ancients spent almost their whole lives 

in the open air, 

either dispatching their business or

 

taking care of the state’s in the public place, or walking in the country, in gardens, on the

 

seashore, in the rain or under the sun, and almost always bareheaded. In all of this, no women;

 

but they were quite able to find them in case of need, and we do not find from their writings

 

and the samples of their conversation which are left to us that intelligence, taste, or even love,

 

lost anything by this reserve. 

(Letter to M. d’Alembert, p. 

204 [p. 1o1]. Italics added.)

But is there a difference between corruption in the form of supple

mentarity and

 

supplementary corruption? Perhaps it is the concept of supplementarity itself that allows us to

 

think these two interpretations of

((179))

interpretation at the same time. From the first departure from nature, the play of history—as

 

supplementarity—carries within itself the principle of its own degradation, of the

 

supplementary degradation, of the degradation of degradation. The acceleration, the

 

precipitation of perversion within history, is implied from the very start by the historical

 

perversion itself.

But the concept of the supplement, considered, as we have already done, as an 

economic

 

concept, should allow us to say the contrary at the same time without contradiction. The logic

 

of the supplement—which is not the logic of identity—allows the acceleration of evil to find

 

at once its historical compensation and its historical guardrail. History precipitates history,

 

society corrupts society, but the evil that links both in an in-definite chain 

[qui les abîme] 

has

 

its natural supplement as well: history and society produce their own resistance to the abyss

 

[l’abîme].

Thus, for example, the “moral part” of love is immoral: captor and destroyer. But just as one

 

may guard presence through defering it, just as one may defer the expense, put off the mortal

 

“cohabitation” with woman by that other power of death which is auto-eroticism, so also,

 

according to this economy of life or death, society may place a moral guardrail over the abyss

 

of “moral love.” The morality of society can in fact defer or weaken the capturing of energy

 

by imposing on woman the virtue of 

modesty. 

Within modesty, that product of social

 

refinement, it is in fact natural wisdom, the economy of life, that controls culture by culture.

 

(Rousseau’s entire discourse, let us note in passing, finds here its proper field of exercise.) As

 

women betray the natural morality of physical desire, society invents—but it is a ruse of

 

nature—the moral imperative of modesty which limits immorality; limits morality in fact, for

 

“moral love” was never immoral except as it menaced man’s life. The theme of modesty has a

 

greater importance in 

The Letter to M. d’Alembert 

than is generally thought. But it is central

 

in 

Emile, 

especially in that Fifth Book which one must follow here line by line. Modesty is

 




clearly defined there as a supple-ment of natural virtue. It has to do with knowing if men wish

 

to allow themselves to be “dragged to their death” (p. 447 [p. 3221), by the num-ber and

 

intemperance of women. Their “boundless desire” does not in fact have that sort of natural

 

restraint that one encounters in female ani

mals. With the latter,

when the need is satisfied, the desire ceases; they no longer make a feint of repulsing the

 

male, they do it in earnest. They do exactly the opposite of what Augustus’ daughter did; they

 

receive no more passengers when the ship has its cargo. . . . Instinct both drives and stops

 

them. 

But what would take the place of 

[supplement] 

this negative instinct in women if you

 

rob them of their mod

esty? 

To wait for them not to concern themselves with men, is to wait

 

for them to be good for nothing. (Italics added.) [And this supplement is indeed the

((180))

economy of men’s lives]: * Their natural intemperance would lead them to death; because it

 

contains their desires, modesty is the true morality of women.

It is clearly confirmed that the concept of nature and the entire system it commands may not

 

be thought except under the irreducible category of the supplement. Although modesty comes

 

to fill the lack of a natural and instinctive restraint, it is, nonetheless, as a supplement, and

 

moral as it certainly is, natural. This product of culture has a natural origin and a natural end.

 

God Himself has inscribed it in His creatures: “The Most High has deigned to do honor to

 

mankind; he has endowed man with boundless passions, together with a law to guide them, so

 

that man may be alike free and self-controlled; though swayed by these passions man is

 

endowed with reason by which to control them. Woman is also endowed with boundless

 

passions; God has given her modesty to restrain them” [p. 323]. Thus God gives 

reason 

to

 

supplement natural inclinations. Reason is thus at once within nature and in a supplementary

 

role to nature; it is a supplementary ration. Which supposes that nature might sometimes lack

 

something within itself or, what is the same thing, might sometimes exceed itself. And God

 

even adds a bonus 

(praemium), a 

recompense, a supple-ment to the supplement: “Moreover,”

 

Rousseau continues, “he has given to both a present reward for the right use of their powers,

 

in the delight which springs from that right use of them, i.e., the taste for right conduct

 

established as the law of our behavior. To my mind this is far higher than the instinct of the

 

beasts” [p. 323].

Guided by this pattern, one would have to reread all the texts describing culture as the

 

corruption of nature: in the sciences, the arts, spectacles, masques, literature, writing. One

 

would have to take them up again within the network of this structure of “moral love,” as the

 

war of the sexes and as the chaining of the force of desire by the feminine principle. Setting

 

not only men against women but also men against men, this war is historic. It is not a natural

 

or biological phenomenon. As in Hegel, it is a war of con

sciousness and desires, not of needs

 

or natural desires. How does one identify it? In particular by what cannot be explained by the

 

scarcity of females or by “the exclusive intervals, during which the females constantly refuse

 

the addresses of the male, which,” Rousseau notes,




amounts to the first cause, for if each female admits the male but during two months in the

 

year, it is the same as if the number of females were five-sixths less. Now, neither of these

 

two cases is applicable to the human species, in which the number of females usually exceeds

 

that of males, and among whom it has never been observed, even among savages, that the

 

females have, like those of other animals, their stated times of passion and indifference. 17

“

Moral love,” not having any biological foundation, is born of the power of the imagination.

 

All the depravity of culture, as the movement of differ

ence and preference, is therefore related

 

to the possession of 

women. 

One must know who will have the women but also what the

 

women will have. And what price will be paid within that calculation of forces. Now

 

according to the principle of acceleration or of capitalization that we have just defined, what

 

opens evil is also that which precipitates toward the worst. Rousseau might say like

 

Montaigne “Our morals bend with a marvelous inclination toward worsening” 

(Essais 

II.82).

 

* Thus writing, here literary, conspires with moral love. The first appears at the same time as

 

the second. But moral love degrades even writing. It enervates writing as it enervates man. It

 

provokes

these throngs of ephemeral works which come to light every day, made only to amuse women

 

and having neither strength nor depth, [and which] fly from the dressing table to the counter.

 

This is the way to rewrite ever again the same things and to make them always new. Two or

 

three will be cited which will serve as exceptions; but I will cite a hundred thousand which

 

will confine the rule. It is for this reason that most of the productions of our age will pass with

 

it, and posterity will think that very few books were written in this age which produced so

 

many. 18

Has this detour taken us far from our initial preoccupation? How will it help us to situate the

 

Essay 

more precisely?

We have just verified that, comprehended by the entire system of opposi

tions that it sustains,

 

the concept of natural pity is fundamental. Yet, according to Starobinski, it is absent, indeed

 

excluded, from the 

Essay on the Origin of Languages. 

And one cannot ignore this fact when

 

assigning it a place within the history and architechtonics of Rousseau’s thought:

The importance of the spontaneous outburst of pity, the unreasoned founda

tion of morality,

 

has been indicated by Rousseau since the Preface to the 

Dis-course; 

cf. p .126 and n. i. In this

 

part of the 

Discourse, 

and later in 

Emile, 

Rousseau does not cease affirming that pity is a

 

virtue that “precedes the usage of all reflexion.” This is the definitive state of Rousseau’s

 

thought on this sub

ject. Now the 

Essay on the Origin of Languages, 

ch. IX, formulates on this

 




point many quite different ideas, which will perhaps allow us to attribute to this text (or at

 

least to this chapter) a date anterior to the final draft of the 

Discourse on the Origin of

 

Inequality. 

In the 

Essay, 

Rousseau does not admit the possibility of an unpremeditated burst of

 

sympathy, and seems more inclined to sustain the Hobbesian idea of the war of all against all:

 

“They were not bound by any idea of common brotherhood and, having no rule but that of

 

force, they believed themselves each other’s enemies. . . . An individual isolated on the face of

 

the earth, at the mercy of mankind, is bound to be a ferocious

((182))

animal. . . . We develop social feeling only as we become enlightened. Al-though pity is

 

native to the human heart, it would remain eternally quiescent unless it were activated by

 

imagination. How are we moved to pity? By getting outside ourselves and identifying with a

 

being who suffers. We suffer only as much as we believe him to suffer. . . . He who has never

 

been reflective is in-capable of being merciful or just or pitying. He is just as incapable of

 

being malicious and vindictive” [pp. 31-321.

This more intellectualist conception of pity agrees with the thought of Wollaston.

Are these affirmations, extracted from the 

Essay 

and quoted by Staro

binski, incompatible

 

with the theses of the 

Discourse 

and 

Emile? 

It seems not. At least for three sorts of reasons:

A.First, Rousseau makes a concession in the 

Essay 

which assures its place within the entire

 

theory—supposedly “later”—of pity. He writes: “Al-though pity is native to the human heart .

 

. .” He thus recognizes that pity is an innate, spontaneous, and prereflexive virtue. That will be

 

the thesis of the 

Discourse 

and of 

Emile.

B.It is “imagination,” not “reason,” without which this pity “natural to man’s heart’.’ would

 

remain unawakened and “inactive.” According to the second 

Discourse, 

natural pity is in

 

danger of being strangled or cor

rupted by reason and reflection. Reflective reason is not

 

contemporaneous with pity. The 

Essay 

does not say the contrary. Pity does not awaken with

 

reason but with imagination which wrenches it from its slumbering in-actuality. Not only does

 

Rousseau take for granted the distinction between imagination and reason, but he makes this

 

difference the strength of his entire thought.

Certainly imagination here has a value whose ambiguity is often recog

nized. If it is able to

 

corrupt us, it is first because it opens the possibility of progress. It 

broaches 

history. Without it

 

perfectibility, which, as one knows, constitutes the absolute distinguishing trait of humanity

 

for Rous-seau, would be impossible. Although the concept of reason is very complex in

 

Rousseau,19 it may be said that, in certain regards, reason, in as much as it is the

 

understanding and the faculty of forming ideas, is less proper to humanity than imagination

 

and perfectibility. We have already noticed in what sense reason may be called natural. One

 




may also remark that from another point of view animals, although they are gifted with

 

intelligence, are not perfectible. They are deprived of the imagination, of that power of

 

anticipation that exceeds the givens of the senses and takes us toward the unperceived:

Every animal has ideas, since it has senses; it even combines those ideas in a certain degree;

 

and it is only in degree that man differs, in this respect, from the brute. Some philosophers

 

have even maintained that there is a greater difference between one man and another than

 

between some men and

((183))

some beasts. It is not, therefore, so much the understanding that constitutes the specific

 

difference between the man and the brute, as the human quality of free agency. (Second

 

Discourse, 

p. 141 [p. 1701)

Liberty is therefore perfectibility. “There is another very specific quality which distinguishes

 

them [man and animal], and which will admit of no dispute. This is the faculty of self-

improvement 

[se perfectionner] 

(p. 142)

[P. 171].

The imagination is at the same time the condition of perfectibility

liberty—and that without

 

which pity would neither awaken nor exercise itself within the human order. It activates and

 

excites a potential power.

1. Imagination inaugurates liberty and perfectibility because sensibility, as well as intellectual

 

reason, filled and satiated by the presence of the perceived, is exhausted by a fixist concept.

 

Animality has no history be-cause feeling and understanding are, at root, functions of

 

passivity. “As reason has little force, interest alone does not have as much force as one

 

believes. Only imagination is active and one excites the passions only by imagination” 

(Letter

 

to the Prince of Wurtemberg. 

11.1o.63). * Immedi

ate consequence: reason, a function of

 

interest and need, the technical and calculating faculty, is not the origin of language, which is

 

also a human property and without which there would be no perfectibility. Language is born

 

of the imagination which arouses or at any rate excites sentiment or passion. This affirmation,

 

which will be repeated ceaselessly, is already there at the opening of the 

Essay: 

“Speech

 

distinguishes man among animals.” The first words of Chapter II: “It seems then that need

 

dictated the first gestures, while the passions wrung forth the first words” [p. 11].

We thus see two series working themselves out: (1) animality, need, interest, gesture,

 

sensibility, understanding, reason, etc. (2) humanity, passion, imagination, speech, liberty,

 

perfectibility, etc.

It will gradually appear that, under the complexity of strands tangled in Rousseau’s texts

 

among these terms, requiring the minutest and most careful analyses, these two series always

 

relate to each other according to the structure of supplementarity. All the names of the second

 




series are meta-physical determinations—and therefore inherited, arranged with a laborious

 

and interrelating coherence—of 

supplementary differance.

A dangerous differance, of course. For we have omitted the master-name of the

 

supplementary series: death. Or rather, for death is nothing, the rela

tionship to death, the

 

anguished anticipation of death. All the possibilities of the supplementary series, which have

 

the relationships of metonymic sub

stitutions among themselves, indirectly name the danger

 

itself, the horizon and source of all determined dangers, the abyss from which all menaces an

-

nounce themselves. We should not be surprised when, in the second 

Dis-

((184))

course, 

the notion of perfectibility or liberty is set forth at the same time as the knowledge of

 

death. The property of man is announced from the double possibility of liberty and of the

 

express anticipation of death. The difference between human desire and, animal need,

 

between relationship with the woman and relationship with the female, is the fear of death:

The only goods he [the animal] recognizes in the universe are food, a female, and sleep: the

 

only evils he fears are pain and hunger. I say pain, and not death: for no animal can know

 

what it is to die; the knowledge of death and its terror being one of the first acquisitions made

 

by man in departing from an animal state. (Second 

Discourse, 

p. 143 [p. 171]) So does the

 

child 

become man when he opens himself to “the consciousness of death.” 

(Emile, 

p. 2o) [p.

 

15]

If one moves along the course of the supplementary series, he sees that imagination belongs to

 

the same chain of significations as the anticipation of death. Imagination is at bottom the

 

relationship with death. The image is death. A proposition that one may define or make

 

indefinite thus: 

the 

image is 

a 

death or 

(the) 

death is 

an 

image. Imagination is the power that

 

allows life to affect itself with its own re-presentation. The image cannot re-present and add

 

the representer to the represented, except in so far as the presence of the re-presented is

 

already folded back upon itself in the world, in so far as life refers to itself as to its own lack,

 

to its own wish for a sup

plement. The presence of the represented is constituted with the help

 

of the addition to itself of that nothing which is the image, announcement of its dispossession

 

within its own representer and within its death. The prop

erty 

[le propre] 

of the subject is

 

merely the movement of that representative expropriation. In that sense imagnation, like

 

death, is 

representative and supplementary. 

Let us not forget that these are the qualities

 

Rousseau ex

pressly recognizes in writing.

Imagination, liberty, and speech belong then to the same structure as the relationship with

 

death (let us rather say relationship than anticipation; to suppose that there is a being-faced-




with death is not necessarily to suppose that there is a relationship established with a more or

 

less distanced point on a horizon of time. It is a structure of presence). How do pity and the

 

identification with others’ suffering intervene there?

2. I have said that the imagination is the only thing which can excite natural pity. Rousseau

 

says this clearly in the 

Essay, 

but, contrary to what Starobinski’s most careful formulation

 

would seem to imply, he also in-variably says it elsewhere. For him, pity never stops being a

 

natural senti-ment or an inner virtue that only imagination has the power to awaken or reveal.

 

Let us note in passing that Rousseau’s entire theory of the theatre also establishes a

 

connection, within representation, between the power of identification—pity—and the faculty

 

of the imagination. If now it is remem

bered that Rousseau gives the name terror to the fear of

 

death 

(Discourse,

((185))

p. 143) [p. 171], one perceives together the entire system which organizes the concepts of

 

terror and pity on the one hand, and of the tragic scene, representation, the imagination, and

 

death on the other. This example makes the ambivalence of the power of imagining

 

understandable: it sur-mounts animality and arouses human passion only by opening the scene

 

and the space of theatrical representation. It inaugurates the perversion whose possibility is

 

itself inscribed in the notion of perfectibility.

The scheme upon which Rousseau’s thought has never varied would therefore be the

 

following: pity is innate, but in its natural purity it is not the property of man in particular, it

 

belongs to all living beings in general. It is “so natural, that the very brutes themselves

 

sometimes give evident proofs of it” [p. 182]. Without imagination, this pity does not awaken

 

of itself in humanity, is not accessible to passion, language, and representa

tion, does not

 

produce identification with the other as with another me. Imagination is the becoming-human

 

of pity.

That is indeed the thesis of the 

Essay: 

“Although pity is native to the human heart, it would

 

remain eternally quiescent unless it were activated by imagination” [p. 32]. This appeal to

 

activation and to actualization by the imagination is so little in contradiction with other texts

 

that one can follow everywhere in Rousseau’s work a theory of 

innateness 

as 

virtuality 

or of

 

naturality as sleeping potentiality.20 Not a very original theory to be sure, but one whose

 

organizing role is indispensable. It asks us to think of nature not as a given, as a real presence,

 

but as a 

reserve. 

This concept is itself confusing: one may determine it as a hidden actuality,

 

dissimulated deposit, but also as a reserve of indeterminate power. Such that the imagi

nation,

 

which makes the power of that reserve come forth, is at once beneficent and maleficent. “In

 

fact such is the empire of the imagination among us and such is its influence, that from it are

 

born not only the virtues and the vices, but also good and evil” 

(Dialogues, Pléiade I, pp. 

815-

16). And if “certain people pervert the usage of this consoling faculty” (ibid.), it is once more

 

by the power of the imagination. Escaping all real and exterior influence, the imagination,

 

faculty of signs and appearances, per-verts itself. It is the subject of perversion. It awakens the

 




potential faculty but just as quickly transgresses it. It brings forth the power which was held

 

back but, by showing that power what lies beyond it, by “superseding” it, imagination

 

signifies for it its powerlessness. It animates the faculty of enjoyment but inscribes a

 

difference between desire and power. If we desire beyond our power of satisfaction, the origin

 

of that surplus and of that difference is named imagination. This permits us to determine a

 

function of the concept of nature or of primitiveness: it is the equilibrium between reserve and

 

desire. An impossible equilibrium, for desire cannot awaken and move out of its reserve

 

except by the imagination, which also breaks the equilibrium. This impossible thing—another

 

name for nature— therefore

((186))

remains a limit. According to Rousseau, ethics, “human wisdom,” “the path of true

 

happiness,” consists, then, in staying as close as possible to that limit, and in “decreasing the

 

difference between our desires and our powers 

[l’excès des désirs sur les facultés].”

In this condition, nature, who does everything for the best, has placed him from the first. To

 

begin with, she gives him only such desires as are necessary for self-preservation and such

 

powers as are sufficient for their satisfaction. All the rest she has stored in his mind as a sort

 

of reserve, to be drawn upon at need. It is only in this primitive condition that we find the

 

equilibrium be

tween desire and power, and then alone man is not unhappy. As 

soon as his

 

potential powers of mind begin to function, imagination, more powerful than all the rest,

 

awakes, and precedes all the rest. 

It is imagination which enlarges the bounds of possibility

 

for us, whether for good or ill, and therefore stimu

lates and feeds desires by the hope of

 

satisfying them. But the object which seemed within our grasp flies quicker than we can

 

follow.... Thus we exhaust our strength, yet never reach our goal, and the nearer we are to

 

pleasure, the further we are from happiness. On the other hand, the more nearly a man’s

 

condition approximates to this state of nature 

the more the difference between his desires and

 

his powers is small, 

and he is therefore less remote from happiness. ... The world of reality

 

has its bounds, the world of imagination is boundless; as we cannot enlarge the one, let us

 

restrict the other; for all the sufferings which really make us miserable arise from the

 

difference between the real and the imaginary. 

(Emile, 

p. 

64 

[pp. 44-451. Italics added.)

Thus we note:

1. that imagination, origin of the difference between power and desire, is determined as

 

differance: 

of or within presence or pleasure 

[jouissance];

2.that the relationship to nature is defined in terms of negative distance. It is not a question of

 

departing from nature, or of rejoining it, but of re

ducing its “distance.”

3.that imagination, which excites other virtual faculties, is none the less itself a virtual faculty:

 

“the most active of all.” So much so that the power of transgressing nature is itself within

 

nature. It belongs to nature’s re-sources. Better: we shall see that the power of transgression

 

holds the reserve in reserve. This being-in-nature has thus the strange mode of being of the

 

supplement. Designating at once the excess and lack of nature 

within 

nature. Here we shall

 




locate the unsteadying of a classical logic through the signification of 

being-within, 

as through

 

one example among others.

In as much as it is “the most active of all” the faculties, imagination can-not be awakened by

 

any faculty. When Rousseau says it “awakens itself,” he means it in a very strictly reflexive

 

sense. Imagination alone has the power of 

giving birth to itself. 

It creates nothing because it is

 

imagination. But it receives nothing that is alien or anterior to it. It is not affected by

((187))

the “real.” It is pure auto-affection. It is the other name of differance as auto-affection.21

Rousseau delineates man out of this possibility. Imagination inscribes the animal within

 

human society. It makes the animal accessible to human-kind. The paragraph of the 

Essay

 

which we are considering ends thus: “He who imagines nothing senses no-one but himself; he

 

is alone in the midst of humankind.” This solitude or this nonbelonging to humankind is due

 

to the fact that suffering remains mute and closed in upon itself. Which sig

nifies on the one

 

hand that it cannot open itself, by the awakening of pity, to the suffering of the other as other;

 

and on the other hand that it cannot exceed itself toward death. Indeed, the animal does have a

 

potential faculty of pity, but it imagines neither the suffering of the other 

as such 

nor the

 

passage from suffering 

to death. 

Indeed, that is one and the same limit. The relation with the

 

other and the relation with death are one and the same opening. That which is lacking in what

 

Rousseau calls the animal is the ability to live its suffering as the suffering of another and as

 

the threat of death.

Thought within its concealed relation to the logic of the supplement, the concept of virtuality

 

or potentiality (like the entire problematic of power and the act) undoubtedly has for its

 

function, for Rousseau in par

ticular and within metaphysics in general, the systematic

 

predetermining of becoming as production and development, evolution or history, through the

 

substitution of the accomplishment of a 

dynamis 

for the substitution of a trace, of pure history

 

for pure play, and, as I noted above, of a welding to

gether for a break. The movement of

 

supplementarity seems to escape this alternative and to permit us to think it.

C. Rousseau thus comes to evoke the awakening of pity by the imagi

nation—that is to say by

 

representation and reflection—in the double but actually in the single sense of those words. In

 

the same chapter, he forbids us to think that before the actualization of pity through

 

imagination, man is wicked and bellicose. Let us recall Starobinski’s interpretation: “In the

 

Essay, 

Rousseau does not admit the possibility of an unpremeditated burst of sympathy, and

 

seems more inclined to sustain the Hobbesian idea of the war of all against all”:

They were not bound by an idea of common brotherhood and, having no rule but that of force,

 

they believed themselves each other’s enemies. . . . An indi

vidual isolated on the face of the

 

earth, at the mercy of mankind, is bound to be a ferocious animal. [Essay, pp. 31–32]




Rousseau does not say “they were each other’s enemies” but “they be

lieved themselves each

 

other’s enemies.” It seems to be that we have the right to, and indeed should, consider that

 

nuance. Primitive hostility

((188))

comes out of a primitive illusion. This first 

opinion 

is due to a misguided belief, born of

 

isolation, feebleness, dereliction. That it is only a simple opinion and already an illusion

 

appears clearly in these three sentences that must not be overlooked:

... they believed themselves each other’s enemies. 

This belief was due to their weakness and

 

ignorance. Knowing nothing, they feared everything. They at-tacked in self-defetse. 

An

 

individual isolated on the face of the earth . . . [Essay, p. 32. Italics added.]

Ferocity is thus not bellicose but fearful. Above all, it is incapable of declaring war. It is the

 

animal’s characteristic (“ferocious animal”), the characteristic of the isolated being who, not

 

having been awakened to pity by the imagination, does not yet participate in sociality or in

 

humankind. That animal, let us emphasize, “would be 

ready 

to do unto others all the evil that

 

he 

feared 

from them. 

Fear and weakness are the sources of cruelty” [Essay, 

p. 32. Italics

 

added]. Cruelty is not positive wickedness. The disposi

tion to do evil finds its resource only in

 

the other, in the illusory representa

tion of evil that the other 

seems 

disposed to do to me.

Is this not already sufficient reason for setting aside the resemblance with the Hobbesian

 

theory of a natural war that imagination and reason would merely organize into a sort of

 

economy of aggressivity? But Rousseau’s text is even clearer. In the 

Essay, 

the paragraph that

 

occupies us comprises another proposition which forbids us to consider the moment of

 

slumber-ing pity as the moment of bellicose wickedness, as a “Hobbesian” moment. How in

 

fact does Rousseau describe that moment (here at least it does not matter if it is real or

 

mythic), the structural instance of slumbering pity? What, according to him, is that moment

 

when language, imagination, relation to death, etc., are still 

reserved?

At that moment, he says, “he who has never been reflective is incapable of being merciful or

 

just or pitying” [p. 32]. To be sure. But that is not to say that he would be unjust and pitiless.

 

He is simply held short of that opposition of values. For Rousseau follows up immediately:

 

“He is just as incapable of being malicious and vindictive. He who imagines nothing is aware

 

only of himself; he is isolated in the midst of mankind” (ibid.).

In that “state,” the oppositions available in Hobbes have neither sense nor value. The system

 

of appreciation within which political philosophy moves, has as yet no chance to function.

 

And one thus sees more clearly within what (neutral, naked, and bare) element that system

 

enters into play. Here one may speak with indifference of goodness or badness, of peace or

 

war: each time it will be as true as false, always irrelevant. What Rous-seau thus reveals is the

 

neutral origin of all ethico-political conceptuality, its field of objectivity, and its axiological

 

system. All the oppositions that follow in the wake of the classical philosophy of history,

 

culture, and society




((189))

must therefore be neutralized. Before this neutraliaztion, or this reduction, political

 

philosophy proceeds within the naiveté of acquired and accidental evidence. And it

 

incessantly risks “the blunder made by those who, in reasoning on the state of nature, always

 

import into it ideas gathered in a state of society” (Second 

Discourse, 

p. 

146) 

[p. 174].

The reduction that the Essay operates has a particular style. Rousseau neutralizes oppositions

 

by erasing them; and he erases them by affirming contradictory values at the same time. The

 

procedure is used with coherence and firmness, precisely in Chapter 9:

This accounts for the apparent contradictions seen in the fathers of nations: so natural, and so

 

inhuman; such ferocious behavior and such tender hearts... These barbaric times were a

 

golden age, not because men were united, but because they were separated. . . . If you wish,

 

men would attack each other when they met, but they rarely met. A state of war prevailed

 

universally, and the entire earth was at peace [p. 33]. 22

To privilege one of the two terms, to believe that only a state of war actually existed, was the

 

Hobbesian error that strangely “redoubles” the illusory “opinion” of the first “men” who

 

“believed they were enemies of each other.” Again no difference between Essay and

 

Discourse. 

The reduc

tion operating within the Essay will be confirmed in the 

Discourse,

 

precisely in the course of a critique of Hobbes. ‘What is reproached in Hobbes is precisely

 

that he concludes too quickly that men were neither naturally awakened to pity, nor “bound by

 

any idea of common fraternity,” that they were therefore wicked and bellicose. We cannot

 

read the Essay as Hobbes might have hastily interpreted it. We cannot conclude wickedness

 

from nongoodness. The Essay says it and the 

Discourse 

confirms it, if we assume that the

 

latter comes after the former:

Above all, let us not conclude, with Hobbes, that because man has no idea of goodness, he

 

must be naturally wicked; that he is vicious because he does not know virtue. . . . Hobbes did

 

not reflect that the same cause, which prevents a savage from making use of his reason, as our

 

jurists hold, prevents him also from abusing his faculties, as Hobbes himself allows: so that it

 

may be justly said that savages are not bad merely because they do not know what it is to be

 

good: for it is neither the development of the understanding nor the restraint of law that

 

hinders them from doing ill; but the peacefulness of their passions, and their ignorance of

 

vice: 

tanto plus in illis proficit vitiorum ignoratio, quam in his cognitio virtutis. 23

One knows also from other indications that the economy of pity does not vary from the Essay

 

to the great works. When pity is awakened itself by imagination and reflection, when sensible

 

presence is exceeded by its image, we can imagine and judge that the other feels and suffers.

 

Yet, we neither can nor should 

simply experience 

the suffering of others 

by itself .




((190))

According to Rousseau pity does not allow the movement of identification to be simple and

 

entire. Apparently for two reasons, actually for a single profound reason. It is a question yet

 

again of a certain 

economy.

1.We neither can nor should feel the pain of others immediately and absolutely, for such an

 

interiorization or identification would be dangerous and destructive. That is why the

 

imagination, the reflection, and the judg

ment that arouse pity also limit its power and hold the

 

suffering of the other at a certain distance. One knows this suffering for what it is, one pities

 

others, but one protects oneself, and holds the evil at arm’s length. This doctrine—which

 

could further be related to the theory of dramatic representation—is formulated in both the

 

Essay and 

Emile. 

The paradox of the relation to the other is clearly articulated in those two

 

texts: the more you identify with the other, the better you feel his suffering as 

his: 

our own

 

suffering is that of the other. That of the other, as itself, must remain the other’s. There is no

 

authentic identification except in a certain non-identification, etc. The Essay:

How are we moved to pity? By getting outside ourselves and identifying with a being who

 

suffers. We suffer only as much as we believe him to suffer. It is not in ourselves, but in him

 

that we suffer [p. 32].

Emile:

He shares the suffering of his fellow-creatures, but he shares it of his own free will and finds

 

pleasure in it. He enjoys at once the pity he feels for their woes and the joy of being exempt

 

from them; he feels in himself that state of vigor which projects us beyond ourselves, and bids

 

us carry elsewhere the superfluous activity of our well-being. To pity another’s woes we must

 

indeed know them, but we need not feel them (p. 270) [p. 190].

We must therefore not let ourselves be destroyed by identification with others. The economy

 

of pity and of morality must always let itself be con

tained within the limits of the love of self,

 

all the more because it alone can illuminate the good of others for us. That is why the maxim

 

of natural goodness: “Do 

to others as you would have them do unto you” 

should be tempered

 

by this other maxim, “much less perfect indeed, but perhaps more useful; 

do good to yourself

 

with as little evil as possible to others” 

(Second 

Discourse, p. 

156) [p. 185]. The latter is put

 

“in place” 

of the former.

2.Further, identification by interiorization would not be moral.

a) It would not recognize suffering as the suffering of the other. Moral

ity, respect for the other,

 

therefore supposes a certain nonidentification. This paradox of pity as relation to the other is

 

presented by Rousseau also as the paradox of the imagination and of time, that is to say of

 

comparison. 

This concept, so important in Rousseau’s thought, is at the center of the Essay’s

 

Chapter IX and it intervenes in the explication of pity.




((191))

In the experience of suffering as the suffering of the other, the imagina

tion, as it opens us to a

 

certain nonpresence within presence, is indispensa

ble: the suffering of others is lived by

 

comparison, as our nonpresent, past or future suffering. Pity would be impossible outside of

 

this structure, which links imagination, time, and the other as one and the same opening into

 

nonpresence:

To pity another’s woes we must indeed know them, but we need not feel them. When we have

 

suffered, when we are in fear of suffering, we pity those who suffer; but when we suffer

 

ourselves, we pity none but ourselves. 

(Emile, 

p. 

2

70) [p. 190]

Just before this, Rousseau had explained this unity of pity and the experience of time in

 

memory or anticipation, in imagination and non-perception in general:

The bodily effect of our sufferings is less than one would suppose; it is memory that prolongs

 

the pain, imagination which projects it into the future, and makes us really to be pitied. This

 

is, I think, one of the reasons why we are more callous to the sufferings of animals than of

 

men, although a fellow-feeling ought to make us identify ourselves equally with either. We

 

scarcely pity the cart-horse in his shed, for we do not suppose that while he is eating his hay

 

he is thinking of the blows he has received and the labors in store for him. 

[Emile] 

(p. 264)

 

[p.186]

b) Identification pure and simple would be immoral because it would remain empirical and

 

would not be produced in the element of the con

cept, of universality, and formality. The

 

condition of morality is that through the unique suffering of a unique being, through his

 

presence and his empirical existence, humanity gives itself up to pity. As long as this con

-

dition is not fulfilled, pity risks becoming unjust. Imagination and tem

porality therefore open

 

the reign of concept and law. One may say that already for Rousseau, the concept—which he

 

also calls comparison—exists as time. It is for him, as Hegel will 

say—Dasein. 

Pity is

 

contemporary with speech and representation:

To prevent pity degenerating into weakness we must generalize it and extend it to mankind.

 

Then we only yield to it when it is in accordance with justice, since justice is of all the virtues

 

that which contributes most to the common good. Reason and self-love compel us to love

 

mankind even more than our neighbor, and to pity the wicked is to be very cruel to other men.

 

(pp. 303–04) 

[Emile, p. 

215] 24

On this point there is no development in Rousseau’s thought. It seems to me that one cannot

 

draw an 

internal 

argument out of this in order to conclude a precociousness or a philosophical

 

anteriority for the Essay. For the moment, the field of external hypotheses is thus opened,

 

even if we

((192))

reserve the possibility of raising other internal problems when the time comes.




The Initial Debate and the Composition of the Essay. 

To treat the ex

ternal problem, we shall

 

deal with some declarations by Rousseau himself in addition to the quotations from Duclos.

 

First an important passage from the 

Confessions. 

From it one may at least conclude that the

 

Essay, 

origi

nally conceived as an appendix to the second 

Discourse, 

was, in Rousseau’s mind,

 

quite separate from his first writings on music. The time is 1761:

Besides these two works and my “Dictionnaire de Musique,” at which I worked from time to

 

time, I had some other writings of less importance, all ready for publication, which I intended

 

to bring out, either separately or in a general collection of my works, if I ever undertook to

 

produce one. The most important of these, most of which are still in manuscript in the hands

 

of Du Peyrou, was an “Essai sur l’Origine des Langues,” which I had read to M. de

 

Malesherbes and the Chevalier de Lorenzi, who expressed his approval of it. I calculated that

 

all these works together, after all expenses, would be worth to me at least 8,000 or io,000

 

francs, which I intended to sink in a life-annuity for myself and Therese. After this, we would

 

go and live together in the corner of some province (p. 56o) [pp. 58o-81].

Malesherbes advised him to publish the 

Essay 

separately.25 All this hap

pened in 1761, at the

 

time of the publication of 

Emile.

From the external point of view, the problem thus seems simple, and we can consider it as

 

closed more than fifty years ago by Masson in an article of 1913. 26 The polemic had been

 

opened by Espinas 27 Fastening upon what he considered to be contradictions in Rousseau’s

 

thought, he was already stressing what in the 

Essay 

and even in the article 

Economie poli-

tique 

in the 

Encyclopaedia 

(an article that poses analogous problems of dating and of internal

 

relationships with the 

Discourse) 

seemed to him to oppose the Second 

Discourse. 

Thus, for

 

example, the 

Discourse, 

which be-gins by “setting aside all facts” in order to describe an ideal

 

structure 

or 

an ideal genesis, is in his view incompatible with the 

Essay, 

which calls to some

 

extent upon Genesis, alludes to names like Adam, Cain, Noah, and deals with a certain factual

 

content which belongs to history as well as to myth. One must of course study carefully

 

Rousseau’s usage of this factual content, and examine if, by using it as a guide to reading or to

 

pivotal examples, Rousseau does not neutralize it as fact—a step which he permits himself to

 

take in the 

Discourse 

as well; notably in those notes to the 

Discourse 

among which, as we

 

know, the 

Essay 

was perhaps supposed to be included.

‘

Whatever the case may be, unlike Starobinski, Espinas does not conclude from this supposed

 

contradiction that the 

Essay 

came before the 

Discourse.

((193))

Considering the quotations from Duclos, he draws the opposite conclusion: the 

Essay 

came

 

after the 

Discourse. 28

Lanson then contests this interpretation 

29

 But always on the same grounds: the 

discrepancy

 

between the 

Essay 

and the major works. For the sake of the philosophical reasons which

 

constitute the real stakes of this debate and indeed animate it, Lanson wishes at all costs to

 

preserve the unity of Rousseau’s thought as it was to fulfill itself in its “maturity.” 30




He must therefore relegate the 

Essay 

to a place among the works of Rousseau’s youth:

The 

Essay on the Origin of Languages is 

certainly in contradiction with the 

Discourse on

 

Inequality. 

But what proof does M. Espinas have for placing the former chronologically after

 

the latter, and very close to it? Some passages quoted by Rousseau from a work by Duclos

 

that appeared in 1754. What value does this argument have, since it is known moreover that

 

the text of the 

Essay 

was revised by Rousseau at least once or twice? The quotations from

 

Duclos could have entered the text at one of those revisions. For my part, I have reason to

 

believe through certain positive indications that the 

Essay on the Origin of Languages 

dates

 

from an epoch when Rousseau’s systematic views were not yet formed, and that under its

 

original title 

(Essai sur le principe de la mélodie), 

it was a reply to Rameau’s 

Démonstration

 

du principe de l’harmonie 

(1749-1750). By its matter and tenor, the 

Essay 

comes out of the

 

same current of thought which exists in Condillac’s 

An Essay on the Origin of Human Knowl

-

edge 

(1746) and in Diderot’s 

Lettre sur les sourds et muets 

(1750-1751). I should be much

 

inclined to place the composition of Rousseau’s 

Essay 

at the latest in 1750, between the

 

composition and the success of the first 

Discourse.

It is difficult to consider the quotations from Duclos as late insertions. Even if in fact they

 

were, as quotations, late, the reading of the 

Com

mentary on General Grammar 

seems to have

 

deeply marked, indeed in-spired, the entire 

Essay. As 

for affinities with Condillac and Diderot,

 

they are far from limited to this work alone.

That is why, on this problem of chronology whose external aspect is so difficult to delimit,

 

Masson’s response to Lanson seems eminently con

vincing to me 31 Here I extract a long

 

fragment of it.

Recalling Lanson’s argument, Masson writes:

These arguments are very skillful and almost convincing; but perhaps they presented

 

themselves to M. Lanson only because he did not wish to find Rousseau in “contradiction”

 

with himself. If the 

Essay 

had not seemed to “contradict” the second 

Discourse, 

who knows if

 

M. Lanson would have pushed the original version so far back? I do not wish to examine here

 

the internal relationships between the 

Essay 

and 

Inequality; 

in my opinion, the

 

“contradiction” between the two works is not as “certain” as M. Lanson judges. I shall limit

 

myself to two external remarks that seem decisive to me. 1) The

((194))

manuscript of the 

Essay on the Origin of Languages is 

still at the Library of Neuchâtel, No.

 

7835 (5 paperbound books, 150 x 230mm., bound, with a blue silk ribbon). Very beautifully

 

written, obviously intended for the press, it car-ries on the first page: by J: J. Rousseau,

 

Citizen of Geneva. It is without a doubt the copy that Jean-Jacques transcribed in 1761, when

 

he thought for a while of using this work in reply to “that Rameau who continued to mistreat

 

him so villainously” (letter to Malesherbes, 9.25.61). Later, very likely at Motiers, as we shall

 

see, he took the copy up again for revision, additions, or corrections, easily recognizable, for

 

the ink and the writing are quite different. If I were studying the 

Essay 

itself,32 these variants

 




would be worth noting; but I have kept only those corrections which are of chronological

 

significance. In the copy of 1761, the text forms a whole: it is one dissertation; the division

 

into chapters was introduced in Motiers’ revision. Thus it is not only to Chapter 20, but to the

 

entire 

Essay 

that the last lines of the work apply: “These super

ficial reflections, which

 

hopefully might give birth to more profound ones, I shall conclude with the passage that

 

suggested them to me: 

To observe in fact and to show by examples, the degree to which the

 

character, customs and interests of a people influence their language, would provide material

 

for a sufficiently philosophical investigation” 

[pp. 73-741. This “passage” is ex

tracted from

 

Duclos’ books, 

Remarques sur la grammaire génerale et raisonnée, 

p. 11, which appeared in

 

the first half of 1754. 2) We have also a more formal testimony given by Rousseau himself.

 

About 1763, he wished to bring together in one small volume three short works that he had in

 

hand: 

L’imitation thédtrale, Essay on the Origin of Languages, Le Lévite d’Ephraim. 

The col

-

lection was never published, but a projected preface remains in one of his note-books of rough

 

drafts (Mss of Neuchâtel, No. 7887 Fos 104-05). From that preface I omit what concerns

 

Theatrical Imitation 

and 

The Levite, 

and publish the paragraph concerning the 

Essay 

33

 

“the

 

second part was at first nothing but’ a part of the 

Discourse on inequality, 

that I cut off from it

 

as too long and out of place. I took it up again [Rousseau had at first written: I completed it]

—pro

voked by 

M. Rameau’s Errors on 

Music—that title which is perfectly fulfilled by the

 

work which bears it—but for two words that I had struck off [in the 

Encyclopaedia].

 

However, restrained by the ridiculousness of holding forth upon languages when one hardly

 

knows one, and, furthermore, discontented with that fragment, I had resolved to suppress it as

 

unworthy of public atten

tion. But an illustrious magistrate, who cultivates and protects letters

 

[Malesherbes], thought of it more favorably than I; I defer with pleasure, as one may well

 

believe, my judgment to his, and with the help of other writings, I attempt to pass off a piece

 

that I might not have risked by itself.” It does not seem that any internal evidence can stand

 

against this testimony by Rousseau himself. In 1754, then, the 

Essay 

on languages was a long

 

note to the second 

Discourse; 

in 1761, it became an independent dissertation, augmented and

 

corrected to make it a riposte to Rameau. Finally, in 1763, this dissertation, revised for one

 

last time, was divided into chapters.

((195))

II. Imitation

We have now been brought quite naturally to the problem of the 

com

position 

of the 

Essay: 

not

 

only of the time of its writing, but of the space of its structure. Rousseau divided it into

 

chapters belatedly. What scheme guided him? The architecture must find its justification in

 

the deep inten

tion of the 

Essay. 

It is for that reason that it interests us. Yet we must not

 

confound the meaning of the architecture with the declared intention of the work.

Twenty chapters of most unequal length. A disquiet 

seems 

to animate all Rousseau’s

 

reflections and to give them their vehemence: they are con

cerned 

at first 

with the origin and

 

degeneration of music. The chapters that concern music, its emergence and its decadence, are

 

contained between Chapter 12, “The Origin of Music and its Relations,” and Chapter 

19,

 

“How Music Has Degenerated.” If one wants to maintain that the destiny of music is the

 

major preoccupation of the 

Essay, 

it must be explained that the chapters that directly concern

 




that subject occupy hardly a third of the work (a little more if you consider the number of

 

chapters, a little less if you consider the number of pages) and that the rest of the essay does

 

not deal with it at all. Whatever may be the history of its writing, its unity of composition is

 

not the less evident and no development is out of alignment.

The Interval and the Supplement. 

The themes of the first eleven chap-ters are the genesis and

 

degeneration of language, the relationships be

tween speech and writing, the difference

 

between the formation of the languages of the north and the languages of the south. Why is it

 

necessary to treat these problems before proposing a theory of music? For several types of

 

reasons.

1. There is no music before language. Music is born of voice and not of sound. No

 

prelinguistic sonority can, according to Rousseau, open the time of music. In the beginning is

 

the song.

This proposition is absolutely necessary within Rousseau’s systematics. If music awakens in

 

song, if it is initially uttered, 

vociferated, 

it is because, like all speech, it is bom in passion.

 

That is to say in the transgression of need by desire and the awakening of pity by imagination.

 

Everything pro

ceeds from this inaugural distinction: “It seems then that need dictated the first

 

gestures, while the passions wrung forth the first words.”

If music presupposes voice, it comes into being at the same time as human society. As speech,

 

it requires that the other be present to me as other through compassion. Animals, whose pity is

 

not awakened by the imagination, have no 

affinity 

with the other as such. That is why there is

 

no animal music. One speaks of animal music only by looseness of vocabulary

((196))

and by anthropomorphic projection. The difference between the glance and the voice is the

 

difference between animality and humanity. Transgressing space, mastering the outside,

 

placing souls in communication, voice tran

scends natural animality. That is to say a certain

 

death signified by space. Exteriority is inanimate. The arts of space carry death within

 

themselves and 

animality 

remains the 

inanimate 

face of 

life. 

The song presents life to itself. In

 

that sense, it is more 

natural 

to man but more foreign to a nature which is in itself dead nature

 

[still life]. One sees here what difference—at the same time interior and exterior—divides the

 

significations of nature, life, animality, humanity, art, speech, and song. The animal who, as

 

we have seen, has no relationship to death, is on the side of death. Speech, on the other hand,

 

is 

living 

speech even while it institutes a relation to death, and so on. It is presence in general

 

that is thus divided. “From this it is evident that painting is closer to nature and that music is

 

more dependent on human art. It is evident also that the one is more interesting than the other

 

precisely because it does more to relate man to man, and gives us some idea of our kind.

 

Painting is often dead and inanimate. It can carry you to the depth of the desert; but as soon as

 

vocal signs strike your ear, they announce to you a being like yourself. They are, so to speak,

 

the organs of the soul. If they also paint solitude for you 

[s’ils 

vous 

peignent aussi la

 

solitude], 

they tell you you are not there alone. Birds whistle; man alone sings. And one

 




cannot hear either singing or a symphony without immediately acknowledging the presence of

 

another intelligent being” (Chap. XVI) [pp. 63-64].

Song is at the orient of music but it does not reduce itself to voice any more than voice

 

reduces itself to noise. In the 

Dictionary of Music, 

Rous-seau confesses his embarrassment in

 

the article 

Song [chant; tune 

in the contemporary English translation]. If the song is indeed “a

 

kind of modifi

cation of the human voice” it is difficult to assign to it an absolutely char

-

acteristic 

[propre] 

modality. After having proposed the 

“calcula [tions] of intervals,”

 

Rousseau advances the most equivocal criterion of 

“perma

nence,” 

and then of melody as

 

“imitation 

of the accents of the speaking or passionate voice.” The difficulty is that the

 

concepts of an intrinsic and systematic description must be found. No more than the voice 34

 

does the song disclose its essence in an anatomical description. But vocal intervals are also

 

alien to the system of musical intervals. Rousseau therefore hesitates, in the 

Dictionary 

as

 

much as in the Essay, between two necessi

ties: of marking the difference between the systems

 

of vocal and musical intervals, but also of reserving all the resources of song in the original

 

voice. The notion of 

imitation 

reconciles these two exigencies within ambiguity. The first

 

chapter of the Essay corresponds in part to this passage in the article 

Song:

((197))

It is very difficult to determine in what the voice which forms the words, differs from that

 

which forms the 

song. 

This difference is sensible, but we cannot very clearly perceive in what

 

it consists, and when we seek to find it, we find it not. Mons. Dodart has made anatomic

 

observations, by favor of which he thinks really to discover, in the different situations of the

 

larynx, the cause of two kinds of voice. But I do not know if these observations or the

 

consequences drawn from them, are to be depended on. There seems to be wanting to the

 

sounds which form the discourse, no more than 

permanence, 

to form a real song: It appears

 

also, that the different inflexions which we give to the voice in speaking, form intervals which

 

are not at all harmonic, 

which form no parts of the system in our music, 

and which

 

consequently not being expressed in notes, are not properly a song for us. 

The 

song 

does not

 

seem natural 

to 

man-kind. 

Tho’ the savages of America sing, because they speak, yet 

a true

 

savage never sung. 

The dumb don’t sing, they form only accents without permanence, a

 

disgustful [sourds—muted] bellowing which their wants draw from them. I should doubt, if

 

the Sieur Pereyre, with all his ingenuity, could ever draw from them any musical air. Children

 

scream, cry, but they don’t sing. The first expressions of nature have nothing in them

 

melodious or sonorous, and they [children] learn to sing, as to speak, from our example. The

 

melodious and appreciable tune, is only an artificial imitation of the accents in the speaking or

 

passionate voice. We 

cry, we complain, without singing; but, in 

song, we 

imi

tate cries and

 

laments; 

and as, 

of all imitations, the most interesting is that 

of 

the human 

passions, so of 

all

 

the methods 

of 

imitating, the most agreeable is the song. 

(Only the word song 

[chant] 

is

 

italicized by Rousseau.)

Through that example one may analyze the subtle functioning of the notions of nature and

 

imitation. On several levels, nature is the ground, the inferior step: it must be crossed,

 

exceeded, but also rejoined. We must return to it, but without annulling the difference. This

 

difference, separat-ing the imitation from what it imitates, must be 

almost nil. 

Through the

 




voice one must transgress the nature that is animal, savage, mute, infant or crying; by singing

 

transgress or modify the voice. But the song must imitate cries and laments. This leads to a

 

second polar determination of nature: it becomes the unity—as ideal limit—of the imitation

 

and what is imitated, of voice and song. If that unity were accomplished, imitation would

 

become useless: the unity of unity and difference would be lived in immediacy. Such,

 

according to Rousseau, is the archeo-teleologic defini

tion of nature. 

Elsewhere 

is the name

 

and the place, the name of the non-place of that nature. Elsewhere in time, 

in illo tempore;

 

elsewhere in space, 

alibi. 

The natural unity of the cry, the voice, and the song, is the proto-

Greek or the Chinese experience. The article 

Voice 

analyses and amplifies the same debate

 

around the theses of Dodart and of Duclos (in the article 

Déclamation des anciens 

in the

 

Encyclopaedia). 

The differences among languages are measured by the distance which, in the

 

system of each

((198))

language, separates the voice of speech from the voice of song, “for as there are languages

 

more or less harmonious, whose accents are more or less musical, we take notice also, in these

 

languages, that the speaking and sing-ing 

voices 

are connected or removed in the same

 

proportion. So, as the Italian language is more musical than the French, its speaking is less

 

distant from song; and in that language it is easier to recognize a man singing if we have

 

heard him speak. In a language which would be completely harmoni

ous, as was the Greek at

 

the beginning, the difference between the speaking and singing voices would be nil. We

 

should have the same voice for speak-ing and singing. Perhaps that may be at present the case

 

of the Chinese” [P• 464]-

2. We have just accepted two pieces of evidence: the unity of nature or the identity of origin is

 

shaped and undermined by a strange difference which constitutes it by breaching it; we must

 

account for the origin of the 

voice of 

speech—therefore of 

society—before 

assigning, and 

in

 

order to assign, 

its possibility to music, that is to say to the 

voice of song. 

But since in the

 

beginning 

of the 

all-harmonious 

voice, word and song are (were) identified, 

before and in

 

order to 

have perhaps a juridical or methodological meaning; they have no structural or

 

genetic value. One might have been tempted to accord a structural value to the difference

 

between speech and song, since Rousseau recognized that the latter comes to “modify” the

 

former. But the archeoteleological concept of nature also annuls the struc

tural point of view.

 

In the beginning or in the ideal of the all-harmonious voice, the modification becomes one

 

with the substance that it modifies. (This scheme has a general value and governs all

 

discourses, from the moment that they make the smallest appeal to any of these notions, no

 

matter which one: nature and its other, archeology and eschatology, sub-stance and mode,

 

origin and genesis.)

Of course, the methodological or juridical point of view has no rigorous value the moment the

 

difference of value between the structural and genetic points of view is annulled. Rousseau

 

does not notice this conse

quence but we should recognize that it would wreak havoc to more

 

than one discourse.




We must now study the consequence. It is a matter of presenting, with reference to the origin

 

of language and society, a certain number of opposi

tions of concepts indispensable for

 

understanding at the same time the pos

sibility of both speech and song. And above all for

 

understanding the tension or the difference that, in language as in music, operates at once as

 

opening and menace, principle of life and of death. Since 

the first 

speech must be 

good, 

since

 

the archeo-teleology of the nature of the language and the language of nature dictate to us, as

 

does “the voice of nature,” that the original and ideal essence of speech is song itself, one

 

cannot treat the two origins separately. But as the method of the discourse must retrace its

 

path

((199))

and take into account the historical regression or degradation, it must sepa

rate the two

 

questions provisionally and, in a certain manner, begin with the end.

This then is the story. For the history that follows the origin and is added to it is nothing but

 

the story of the separation between song and speech. If we consider the difference which

 

fractured the origin, it must be said that this history, which is decadence and degeneracy

 

through and through, had no prehistory. Degeneration as separation, severing of voice and

 

song, has always already begun. We shall see that Roussau’s entire text 

describes 

origin as the

 

beginning of the end, as the inaugural decadence. Yet, in spite of that description, the text

 

twists about in a sort of oblique effort to act 

as if 

degeneration were not prescribed in the

 

genesis and as if evil 

super

vened upon a 

good origin. As if song and speech, which have the

 

same act and the same birthpangs, had not always already begun to separate themselves.

Here one reencounters the advantages and dangers of the concept of the supplement, and also

 

of the concept of “fatal advantage” and “dangerous supplement.”

The growth of music, the desolating separation of song and speech, has the form of writing as

 

“dangerous supplement”: calculation and gram

maticality, loss 

of energy and substitution. 

The

 

history of music is parallel to the history of the language, its evil is in essense graphic. When

 

he under-takes to explain 

how music has degenerated 

(Chapter 19), Rousseau recalls the

 

unhappy history of the language and of its disastrous “perfecting”: “To the degree that the

 

language improved, melody, being governed by new rules, imperceptibly 

lost 

its 

former

 

energy, 

and the 

calculus of intervals was substituted for nicety of inflection” 

(italics added) [p.

 

68].

Substitution distances from birth, from the natural or maternal origin. Forgetfulness of the

 

beginning is a calculation that puts harmony in the place of melody, the science of intervals in

 

the place of the warmth of accent. In this weaning of the voice of speech, a “new object”

 

comes at once to usurp and compensate for the “maternal traits.” What suffers then from this

 

is the “oral accent.” Music thus finds itself “deprived of its” proper, that is to say natural and

 

moral, “effects”: “Melody being 

forgotten, 

and the attention of musicians being completely

 

turned toward harmony, everything gradually came to be governed according to this 

new

 

object. 

The genres, the modes, the scale, all received new faces. Harmonic successions came

 

to dictate the sequence of parts. This sequence having 

usurped the name 

of melody, it was, in

 




effect, impossible to recognize the 

traits of its mother 

in this new melody. And our musical

 

system having thus 

gradually 

become purely harmonic, it is not surprising that its 

oral tone

 

[accent] 

has 

suffered, 

and that our music has lost almost all its 

energy. 

Thus we see how

 

singing 

gradually 

became an art entirely 

separate 

from speech, from which

((200))

it takes its origin; how the harmonics of sounds resulted in the 

forgetting 

of vocal inflections;

 

and finally, how music, restricted to purely physical concurrences of vibrations, found itself

 

deprived 

of the moral power it had yielded when it was the 

twofold voice of nature” 

(italics

 

added) [p. 71].

The points italicized in the passage should guide a subreading of this text and of many

 

analogous texts. On each occasion one would notice:

1 That Rousseau weaves his text with heterogeneous threads: the in

stanteous 

displacement

 

that 

substitutes a “new object,” 

which institutes a substitutive supplement, must constitute a

 

history, a progressive becoming 

gradually 

producing the 

forgetting 

of the voice of nature. The

 

violent and irruptive movement that 

usurps, separates 

and 

deprives 

is simultaneously

 

described as a progressive implicating of, and a gradual distancing from, the origin, a slow

 

growth of a disease of language. Weaving together the two significations of supplementarity

—substitution and accretion—Rousseau describes the replacement of an 

object 

as a deficit in

 

energy, 

the production of a re-placement as effacement by forgetting.

2. The adverb “doubly” [twofold] summons up in its own condition of possibility the

 

metaphor of the voice of nature: “gentle voice,” maternal voice, song as original voice, sung

 

speech conforms to the prescriptions of natural law. In every sense of this word, nature

 

speaks. And to hear and understand the laws formed by her gentle voice—which, as we recall,

 

“no one is tempted to disobey,” but which one must have been tempted to dis

obey—it is

 

necessary to find again the “oral accent” of sung speech, take possession again of our own lost

 

voice, the voice which, uttering and hear-ing, understanding-itself-signifying a melodious law,

 

“was the twofold voice of nature.”

The Engraving and the Ambiguities of Formalism. 

How was this sup

plementary substitution

 

fatal? How is it fatal? How 

was it to 

be—for such is the time of its 

quiddity—what 

it

 

necessarily is? What is the fissure that, within the origin itself, destines its appearance?

This fissure is not one among others. It is 

the 

fissure: the necessity of interval, the harsh law

 

of spacing. It could not endanger song except by being inscribed in it from its birth and in its

 

essence. Spacing is not the accident of song. Or rather, as accident and accessory, fall and

 

supplement, it is also that without which, strictly speaking, the song would not have come into

 

being. In the 

Dictionary, 

the interval is a part of the definition of song. It is therefore, so to

 

speak, an originary accessory and an essential acci

dent. Like writing.

Rousseau says it without wishing to say it.* What he wishes to say is:

((201))

accessory accessory, accidental accident, the exterior outside, the supple

mentary evil or the

 

accessory supplement. And space exterior to time. Spac

ing alien to the time of melody. As we

 

shall see, even while saying that spacing assures the possibility of speech and song. Rousseau

 

wishes 

to think of space as a simple outside by way of which disease and death in general, and

 

especially the disease and death of sung speech, make their entry. He wishes to pretend that

 

the “fineness of infections” and of the “oral accent” did not already and always lend itself to

 

spatialization, geometricization, grammaticalization, regularization, prescription; or to reason.

 

As he wishes to efface this 

always-already, 

he determines spacing as an event and as a

 

catastrophic event. We shall have to come back more than once to that concept of catastrophe.

 

Let us note here that this catastrophe has indeed the form of philosophic reason. That is why

 

the birth of philosophy during the epoch of Greek tragedy constitutes the best example of such

 

a catastrophe:

When the theaters had taken a regular form, all singing was according to pre-scribed modes.

 

And, to the degree that the rules of imitation proliferated, imita

tive language was enfeebled.

 

The study of philosophy and the progress of reasoning, while having perfected grammar,

 

deprived language of its vital, pas

sionate quality which made it so singable. Composers, who

 

originally were engaged by poets and worked only for them, under their direction so to speak,

 

were becoming independent as early as the time of Melanippides and Philoxenus. This is the

 

license of which Music complains so bitterly in a comedy of Pherecrates, according to the

 

passage preserved by Plutarch. Thus melody, origi

nally an aspect of discourse, imperceptibly

 

assumes a separate existence and music becomes more independent of speech. That is also

 

when it stopped pro

ducing the marvels it had produced when it was merely the accent and

 

harmony of poetry and gave to it the power over the passions that speech subsequently

 

exercised only on reason. Thus, as soon as Greece became full of sophists and philosophers,

 

she no longer had any famous musicians or poets. In cultivating the art of convincing, that of

 

arousing the emotions was lost. Plato himself, envious of Homer and Euripides, decried the

 

one and was unable to imitate the other. [Essay, pp. 68–69]

Further, according to the law of supplementary acceleration that we noticed above and that we

 

could call the law of 

geometric regression, 

an-other catastrophe necessarily adds itself to the

 

first. Almost all the signifi

cations that will constantly define the figure of evil and the process

 

of its degeneration are recorded there: a simultaneously violent and progressive substitution of

 

servitude for political freedom as freedom of the living word, dissolution of the small

 

democratic and autarchic city, preponderance of articulation over accentuation, of consonant

 

over vowel, of northern over southern, of the capital over the province. Going necessarily in

 

the direction

((202))

of the first catastrophe, the supplementary catastrophe nevertheless de

stroys its positive or

 

compensating effects. Let us italicize:




Servitude 

soon 

joined 

forces with philosophy. In fetters, Greece lost the fire that warms only

 

free spirits, and in praising her tyrants, she never recovered the style 

[ton] 

in which she had

 

sung her heroes. The intermingling of the Romans further weakened whatever harmony and

 

accent remained to the language. Latin, a less musical, more 

surded [mute] 

tongue, did harm

 

to the music in adopting it. The singing employed in the 

capital 

gradually corrupted that of

 

the provinces. The Roman theaters harmed 

[nuisirent à] 

those of Athens. When Nero carried

 

off the prize, Greece had ceased to merit any. And the same melodiousness, parceled between

 

two tongues, had become less well suited to either. Finally came the 

catastrophe that

 

disrupted the progress of the human spirit without removing the faults that were its product.

 

Europe, flooded with 

barbarians, enslaved 

by ignoramuses, lost at the same time her sciences,

 

her arts, and that universal instrument of both: that is, 

harmoniously perfected language.

 

Imperceptibly, these coarse men engendered by the 

North 

made every ear accustomed to their

 

rude voices. Their harsh, 

expressionless [dénuée d’accent] 

voices were noisy without being

 

sonorous. The Emperor Julian compared Gallic speech to the croaking of frogs. All their

 

articulations, 

like their voices, being nasal and 

muffled, 

they could give only some kind of

 

distinctness to their singing, augmenting the vowel sounds to cover up 

the abundance and

 

harshness of the consonants. 

(Chap. 1

9

) 

[Essay, 

p. 

69]

In addition to the system of oppositions that controls the entire Essay (servitude/politico-

linguistic liberty, North/South, articulation/accent, con

sonant/vowel,

 

capital/province//autarchic and democratic city), we may perceive here the strange workings

 

of the historical process according to Rousseau. It never varies: beginning with an origin or a

 

center that divides itself and leaves itself, an historical circle is described, which is

 

degenerative in direction but progressive and compensatory in effect. On the circum

ference of

 

that circle are new origins for new circles that accelerate the degeneration by annulling the

 

compensatory effects of the preceding circle, and thereby also making its truth and

 

beneficence appear. It is thus, by destroying the “progress of the human spirit” that the

 

anterior cycle had produced, that the invasion of the northern barbarians ushered in a new

 

cycle of historical degeneration. The harmful and dissolving effects of philosophy had in fact

 

been limited by themselves. Their system comprised, in some way, its own curb. Within the

 

following system or circle, that curb will have disappeared. Follows an acceleration of evil,

 

which nevertheless will find a new internal regulation, a new organ of equilibrium, a new sup

-

plementary compensation (which will consist for example of “reinforcing vowel sounds to

 

cover the abundance and harshness of consonants”), and thus to infinity. But this infinity is

 

still not that of a horizon or an abyss, of a progress or a fall. It is the infinity of a repetition

 

following a strange course. For the preceding diagram must be complicated further: each new

 

cycle

((203))

begins a progression-regression which, destroying the effects of the preced

ing one, brings us

 

back to a nature yet more secret, more ancient, more archaic. Progress consists always of

 

taking us closer to animality while annulling the progress through which we have transgressed

 

animality. I shall confirm it often. In any case, it would be difficult to represent the “thus to

 

infinity” of this movement by the tracing of a line, however complicated that line might be.




What cannot be thus represented by a line is the turn (trick/trope) of the re-turn when it has

 

the bearing of re-presentation. What one -cannot represent is the relationship of representation

 

to so-called originary pres

ence. The re-presentation is also a de-presentation. It is tied to the

 

work of spacing.

Spacing insinuates into presence an interval which not only separates the different times of

 

speech and of song but also the represented from the representer. Such an interval is

 

prescribed by the origin of art as determined by Rousseau. According to a tradition that

 

remains imperturbable here, Rousseau is sure that the essence of art is 

mimesis. 

Imitation

 

redoubles pres

ence, adds itself to it by supplementing it. Thus it makes the present pass into

 

its outside. In the inanimate arts, the outside is split and it is the reproduction of the outside in

 

the outside. The presence of the thing itself is already exposed in exteriority, it must therefore

 

be depresented and represented in an outside of the outside. In the living arts, and

 

preeminently in song, the outside imitates the inside. It is 

expressive. 

It “paints” passions. The

 

metaphor which makes the song a painting is possible, it can wrest from itself and drag

 

outside into space the intimacy of its virtue, only under the common authority of the concept

 

of imitation. Painting and song are reproductions, whatever might be their differences; the

 

inside and the outside share them equally, expression has already begun to make pas

sion go

 

outside itself, it has begun to set it forth and to paint it.

That confirms what we proposed above: imitation cannot allow itself to be appreciated by a

 

simple act. Rousseau has need of imitation, he advances it as the possibility of song and the

 

emergence out of animality, but he exalts it only as a reproduction adding itself to the

 

represented though it 

adds nothing, 

simply supplements it. In that sense he praises art or

 

mimesis 

as a supplement. But by the same token praise may instantly turn to criticism. Since

 

the supplementary mimesis adds 

nothing, is 

it not useless? And if nevertheless, adding itself

 

to the represented, it is not nothing, is that imi

tative supplement not dangerous to the integrity

 

of what is represented and to the original purity of nature?

This is why, travelling along the system of supplementarity with a blind infallibility, and the

 

sure foot of the sleepwalker, Rousseau must at once denounce 

mimesis 

and art as supplements

 

(supplements that are dan

gerous when they are not useless, superfluous when they are not

 

disastrous,

((204))

in truth both at the same time) and recognize in them man’s good fortune, the expression of

 

passion, the emergence from the inanimate.

It is the status of the 

sign 

that is marked by the same ambiguity. Signifier imitates signified.

 

Art is woven with signs. In so far as signification seems to be, at first glance at least, nothing

 

but an instance of imitation, let us turn to 

Emile. 

The ambiguity of the treatment reserved for

 

imitation in that book will clarify those passages in the Essay that deal with the sign, art, and

 

imitation.




Pedagogy cannot help but encounter the problem of imitation. What is example? Should one

 

educate by example or explanation? Should the teacher make an example of himself and not

 

interfere any further, or pile lesson upon exhortation? And is there virtue in being virtuous by

 

imitation? All these questions are asked in the second book of 

Emile.

The problem at first is knowing how to teach generosity or “liberality” to the child. Even

 

before the word and the theme of imitation occupy the front of the stage, the problem of the

 

sign is posed. To teach the child true generosity is to make sure that he is not content only to

 

imitate it. What does it mean to imitate generosity? It is to give signs in the place of things,

 

words in the place of sentiments, money in the place of real goods. There-fore the child must

 

be taught not to imitate liberality, and this teaching must combat resistance. The child

 

spontaneously wants to guard his goods and put one off the scent [literally, give away the

 

coin]: “Observe that the only things children are set to give are things of which they do not

 

know the value, bits of metal carried in their pockets for which they have no further use. A

 

child would rather give a hundred coins than one cake” 

[Emile, 

p. 67]. What one gives easily

 

is not signifiers inseparable from signifieds or things, it is the devalued signifiers. The child

 

would not give away money so easily if he knew how to, or could, do something with it. “But

 

get this prodigal giver to distribute what is dear to him, his toys, his sweets, his own lunch,

 

and we shall soon see if you have made him really generous” 

(Emile, 

pp. 97—99) [p. 67].

Not that the child is naturally greedy. He desires naturally to keep what he desires. It is normal

 

and natural. Here vice or perversity would consist of not attaching oneself to things that are

 

naturally desirable but to their substitutive signifiers. If a child loved money for money’s sake,

 

he would be perverse; he would no longer be a child. 

For 

Rousseau 

the concept of the child is

 

always related to the sign. More precisely, childhood is the non-relation to the sign as such.

 

But what is a sign as such? There is no sign as such. Either the sign is considered a thing, and

 

it is not a sign. Or it is a reference, and thus not itself. According to Rousseau, the child is the

 

name of that which should not relate in any way to a separated signifier, loved in some way

 

for itself, like a fetish. This perverse use of the signifier is in a cer

tain way at once forbidden

 

and tolerated by the structure of imitation.

((205))

As soon as a signifier is no longer imitative, undoubtedly the threat of per-version becomes

 

acute. But already within imitation, the gap between the thing and its double, that is to say

 

between the sense and its image, assures a lodging for falsehood, falsification, and vice.

Hence the hesitation in 

Emile. 

On the one hand, everything begins with imitation and the

 

child learns only by example. Here 

imitation is good, 

it is more human, it has nothing to do

 

with aping. Those who, following, Locke’s argument, give children reasons for the advantage

 

of being liberal rather than examples of liberality, would in fact be the deceptive ones. One

 

will never pass from that “usurious liberality” to the true generosity that is transmitted only by

 

example and 

good imitation: 

“Teachers, have done with these shams; be good and kind; let

 

your example sink into your scholars’ memories until they can enter their hearts” 

[Emile, 

p.

 

68].




But this good imitation already carries within itself the premises of its corruption 

[altération].

 

And all the problems of pedagogy in 

Emile 

may be summarized in this fact. The child is at

 

first passive, the example engraves itself within the memory, 

“waiting” 

to enter the heart. It

 

may remain in the memory without entering the heart; and conversely, because of the re-

semblance between the heart and memory, the child may feign feeling from the heart when he

 

actually contents himself with imitating according to the signs of memory. He may always

 

content himself with 

giving signs. 

A first time, good imitation may be impossible, a second

 

time, it may be turned away from its good usage. “Rather than hasten to demand deeds of

 

charity from my pupil I prefer to perform such deeds in his presence, even depriv

ing him of

 

the means of imitating me, as an honor beyond his years” 

[Emile, 

p. 

68]. 

“I know that all

 

these imitative virtues are only the virtues of a monkey, and that a good action is only morally

 

good when it is done as such and not because others do it. But at an age when the heart does

 

not yet feel anything, you must make children copy the deeds you wish to grow into habits,

 

until they can do them with understanding and for the love of what is good” 

[Emile, p. 68]. 

35

The possibility of imitation seems thus to interrupt natural simplicity. With imitation, is it not

 

duplicity that insinuates itself within presence? And yet, according to a scheme that we have

 

already identified, Rousseau wished that good imitation should regulate itself according to a

 

natural imi

tation. The taste for and power of imitation are inscribed within nature. Like

 

pretense, if they are a corruption of imitation, vice and duplicity are not daughters of but

 

diseases of imitation, are not its natural effect but a monstrous anomaly. Evil is a result of a

 

sort of perversion of imitation, of the imitation within imitation. And that evil has a social

 

origin.

Man imitates, as do the beasts. The love of imitating comes from well-regulated nature; in

 

society it becomes a vice. The monkey imitates man, whom he fears, and not the other beasts,

 

which he scorns; he thinks what is done by his betters

((206))

must be good. Amongst us, on the other hand, our harlequins imitate all that is good to

 

degrade it and bring it into ridicule; knowing their own baseness they try to equal what is

 

better than they are, or if they strive to imitate what they ad-mire, their bad taste appears in

 

their choice of models, they would rather deceive others or win applause for their own talents

 

than become wiser or better. 

[Emile, 

p. 68]

Here the relationships among childhood, animality, and man in society order themselves

 

according to the structure and problematics which we had such difficulty in outlining in the

 

analysis of pity. And it is not by chance: the same paradox—of the alteration of identity and of

 

identification with the other—is here at work. Imitation and pity have the same foundation: a

 

sort of metaphorical ecstacy: “Imitation has its roots in our perpetual desire to transport

 

ourselves outside of ourselves (ibid.).

Let us return to the 

Essay. 

The ruses of metaphor now appear in the mimetology of all the

 

arts. If art is imitation, it is essential to remember that everything in it 

signifies. 

In the

 

aesthetic experience, we are affected not by things but by signs:




No one doubts that man is changed by his senses. But instead of distinguishing the changes,

 

we confuse them with their causes. We attach too much and too little importance to

 

sensations. We do not see that frequently they affect us not merely as sensations, but as signs

 

or images, and that their moral effects also have moral causes. Just as the feelings that a

 

painting excites in us are not at all due to colors, the power of music over our souls is not at

 

all the work of sounds. Beautiful, subtly shaded colors are a pleasing sight; but this is purely a

 

pleasure of the sense. It is the drawing, the imitation, which gives life and spirit to these

 

colors. The passions they express are what stir ours; the objects they represent are what affect

 

us. Colors entail no interest or feeling at all. The strokes of a touching picture affect us even in

 

a print. Without these strokes in the picture, the colors would do nothing more (Chap. XIII)

 

[p. 53].

If art operates through the sign and is effective through imitation, it can only take place within

 

the system of a culture, and the theory of art is a theory of mores. A “moral” impression,

 

contrary to a “ ‘sensible’ impres

sion,” is recognized through the fact that it places its force in

 

a sign. Aesthetics passes through a semiology and even through an ethnology. The effects of

 

aesthetic signs are only determined within a cultural system. “Unless the influence of

 

sensations upon us is due mainly to moral causes, why are we so sensitive to impressions that

 

mean nothing to the uncivilized? Why is our most touching music only a pointless noise to the

 

ear of a West Indian? Are his nerves of a different nature from ours?” (Chap. XV) 

[Essay, 

p.

 

59].

Medicine itself must take account of the semiological culture within which it must heal. As

 

with the therapeutic art, the therapeutic effects of art are not natural in as much as they work

 

through signs; and if the cure is

((207))

a language, the remedies must make themselves understood to the sick through the code of his

 

culture:

The healing of tarantula bites is cited as proof of the physical power of sounds. But in fact this

 

evidence proves quite the opposite. What is needed for curing those bitten by this insect are

 

neither isolated sounds, nor even the same tunes. Rather, each needs tunes with familiar

 

melodies and understandable lyrics. Italian tunes are needed for Italians; for Turks, Turkish

 

tunes. Each is affected only by accents familiar to him. His nerves yield only to what his spirit

 

pre-disposes [for] them. One must speak to him in a language he understands, if he is to be

 

moved by what he is told. The cantatas of Bernier are said to have cured the fever of a French

 

musician. They would have given one to a musician of any other nation. (Chap..15 ) [Essay, p.

 

60]

Rousseau does not go so far as to consider that the symptoms them-selves belong to a culture

 

and that the bite of a tarantula might have dif

ferent effects in different places. But the

 

principle of such a conclusion is clearly indicated in his explication. There is a single

 

exception, which is more than simply strange, within this ethno-semiotics: cooking, or rather

 

taste. Rousseau condemns gluttony without mercy. One might wonder why: “I know of only

 




one affective sense in which there is no moral element: that is taste. And, accordingly,

 

gluttony is the main vice only of those who have no sense of taste” (ibid.). “Who have no

 

sense of taste” means here, of course, “who do nothing but taste,” who have nothing but

 

uneducated and uncultivated sensations.

As the value of 

virtuality 

or potentiality further introduces here an ele

ment of transition and

 

confusion, of graduality and of shifts within the rigor of distinctions and within the

 

functioning of concepts—limits of ani

mality, childhood, savagery, etc.—one must admit that

 

“moral impres

sions” through signs and a system of differences can always be already dis

-

cerned, although confusedly, in the animal. “Something of this moral effect is perceivable

 

even in animals.” We realized the need for this hesita

tion in connection with pity, and at the

 

same time with imitation:

So long as one insists on considering sounds only in terms of the shock that they excite in our

 

nerves, one will not attain the true principle of music, nor its power over men’s hearts. The

 

sounds of a melody do not affect us merely as sounds, but as signs of our affections, of our

 

feelings. It is thus that they excite in us the emotions that they express, whose image we

 

recognize in it. Something of this moral effect is perceivable even in animals. The barking of

 

one dog will attract another. When my cat hears me imitate a mewing, I see it become im

-

mediately attentive, alert, agitated. ‘When it discovers that I am just counter-feiting the voice

 

of its species, it relaxes and resumes its rest. Since there is nothing at all different in the

 

stimulation of the sense organ, and the cat had initially been deceived, what accounts for the

 

difference? (ibid.)

((208))

From this irreducibility of the semiotic order, Rousseau also draws con

clusions against the

 

sensationalism and materialism of his own century: “Colors and sounds can do much, as

 

representations and signs, very little simply as objects of sense” 

[Essay, 

p. 61]. The argument

 

for art as signi

fying text is at the service of metaphysics and of spiritualist ethics: “I be

lieve

 

that had these ideas been better developed, we should have been spared many stupid

 

arguments about ancient music. But in this century when all the operations of the soul have to

 

be materialized, and even human feeling deprived of all morality, I am deluded if the new

 

philosophy does not become as destructive of good taste as of virtue” (ibid.) .

We must be attentive to the ultimate finality of the esteem which the sign enjoys. According to

 

a general rule which is important for us, atten

tion to the signifier has the paradoxical effect of

 

reducing it. Unlike the con

cept of the supplement which, of course, 

signifies 

nothing, simply

 

replaces a lack, the signifier, as it is indicated in the grammatical form of this word and the

 

logical form of the concept, signifies a signified. One cannot sepa

rate its effectiveness from

 

the signified to which it is tied. It is not the body of the sign that acts, for that is all sensation,

 

but rather the signified that it expresses, imitates, or transports. It would be wrong to conclude

 

that, in Rousseau’s critique of sensationalism, it is the sign itself that exhausts the operation of

 

art. We are moved, “excited,” by the represented and not by the representer, by the expressed

 

and not by the expression, by the inside which is exposed and not by the outside of the

 

exposition. Even in painting, representation comes alive and touches us only if it imitates an

 




object, and, better, if it expresses a passion: “It is the drawing, the imi

tation, which gives life

 

and spirit to these colors. The passions they express are what stir ours. . . . The strokes of a

 

touching picture affect us even in a print” 

[Essay, 

p. 

53].

The engraving: 

art being born of imitation, only belongs to the work proper as far as it can be

 

retained in an engraving, in the reproductive impression of its 

outline. 

If the beautiful loses

 

nothing by being repro

duced, if one recognizes it in its sign, in the sign of the sign which a

 

copy must be, then in the “first time” of its production there was already a re-productive

 

essence. The engraving, which copies the models of art, is none

theless the model for art. If the

 

origin of art is the possibility of the en-graving, the death of art and art as death are prescribed

 

from the very birth of the work. The principle of life, once again, is confounded with the

 

principle of death. Once again, Rousseau desires to separate them but once again, he accedes

 

within his description and within his text to that which limits or contradicts his desire.

On the one hand, in fact, Rousseau does not doubt that imitation and formal outline are the

 

property of art and he inherits, as a matter of course, the traditional concept of 

mimesis; a

 

concept that was first that of the phi-

((209))

losophers whom Rousseau, one must remember, accused of having killed song. This

 

accusation could not be radical, since it moved within the con

ceptuality inherited from this

 

philosophy and of the metaphysical concep

tion of art. The outline that lends itself to the print

 

or engraving, the line which 

is imitated, 

belongs to all the arts, to the arts of space as much as

 

to the arts of duration, to music no less than to painting. In both it out-lines the space of

 

imitation and the imitation of space.

Music is no more the art of combining sounds to please the ear than painting is the art of

 

combining colors to please the eye. If there were no more to it than that, they would both be

 

natural sciences rather than fine arts. Imitation alone raises them to this level. But what makes

 

painting an imitative art? Drawing. What makes music another? Melody. (Chap. 13) 

[Essay, 

p.

 

55]

The 

outline 

(design or melodic line) is not only what permits imitation and the recognition of

 

the represented in the representer. It is the ele

ment of formal difference which permits the

 

contents (colored or sonorous substance) to appear. By the same token, it cannot 

give rise 

to

 

[literally 

pro-vide space 

for] art (techné) as 

mimesis 

without constituting it forthwith as 

a

 

technique of imitation. 

If art lives from an originary reproduction, the outline that permits this

 

reproduction, opens in the same stroke the space of calculation, of grammaticality, of the

 

rational science of intervals, and of those “rules of imitation” that are fatal to energy. Let us

 

recall: “And, to the degree that the rules of imitation proliferated, imitative language was

 

enfeebled” 

[Essay, p. 68]. 

Imitation is therefore at the same time the life and the death of art.

 

Art and death, art and its death are comprised in the space of the 

alteration 

of the originary

 

iteration (iterum, 

anew, does it not come from Sanskrit 

itara, 

other?); of repetition,

 

reproduction, repre

sentation; or also in space as the possibility of iteration and the exit from

 

life placed outside of itself.




For the outline is spacing itself, and marking figures, it shapes the surfaces of painting as

 

much as the time of music:

The role of melody in music is precisely that of drawing in a painting. This is what constitutes

 

the strokes and figures, of which the harmony and the sounds are merely the colors. But, it is

 

said, melody is merely a succession of sounds. No doubt. And drawing is only an arrangement

 

of colors. An orator uses ink to write 

out 

his compositions: does that mean ink is a very

 

eloquent liquid? (Chap. 13) 

[Essay, 

p. 53]

Thus disengaging a concept of formal difference, criticizing with vigor an aesthetic that one

 

might call substantialist rather than materialist, more attentive to sensory content than to

 

formal composition, Rousseau yet places a great deal of the burden of art—here music—upon

 

the 

outline. 

That is to say to what can give rise to cold calculation and the mles of imitation.

 

According to a logic with which we are now familiar, Rousseau

((210))

confronts that danger 

by opposing good form to bad form, 

the form of life to the form of

 

death, 

melodic 

to 

harmonic 

form, form with imitative con-tent to form without content, form

 

full of sense to empty abstraction. 

Rousseau reacts against formalism. In his eyes formalism

 

is also a mate

rialism and a sensationalism.

It is difficult to understand what is at stake in Chapters 13—“On Mel

ody”—and 14—“On

 

Harmony”—if one does not perceive its immediate context: the polemic with Rameau. These

 

chapters assemble and stylize a discussion developed in the corresponding articles of the

 

Dictionary of Music 

and in the 

Examen des deux principes avancés par M. Rameau dans sa

 

brochure intitulé 

“Erreurs sur la musique,” 

dans 

l’Encyclopedie” (1755) . But this context

 

serves only to reveal a systematic and permanent necessity.

For Rousseau the difference between the melodic and harmonic form has a decisive

 

importance. By all the features that distinguish them, they are opposed, as the life to the death

 

of the song. Yet, if one thinks of the origin of the word (“originally a proper name”) and of

 

“the ancient treatises that we have remaining,” 

“harmony 

would be very difficult to dis

-

tingiush from melody, unless one adds to the latter the ideas of ryhthm and measure, without

 

which, in effect, no melody can have a determined char

acter; whereas 

harmony 

has its own by

 

itself, independent of every other quantity” 

[Dictionary, 

pp. 286-87]. The difference proper to

 

harmony must thus be looked for in the moderns, for whom it is “a succession of concords

 

according to the laws of modulation.” The principles of this harmony have been assembled

 

into systems only by the modems. Examining that of Rameau, Rousseau reproaches him first

 

for passing off as natural what is purely conventional: “I ought however to declare, that this

 

system, as ingenious as it may appear, is not in any way founded on nature, as he incessantly

 

repeats it; that it is established only on analogies and conveniencies, which one, who is

 

tolerable at invention, might over throw tomorrow, by others much more natural” 

(Dictionary

 

[p. 

187]). Rameau’s fault is twofold: an artificialist exuberance and an illusory or abusive

 

recourse to nature, an excess of arbitrariness which claims to be grounded solely in the

 




physics of sound. One cannot deduce a science of series and intervals from simple physics;

 

Rousseau’s argument is noteworthy in many ways:

The physical principle of the resonance presents to us the solitary concords and establishes

 

not the succession. A regular succession is however necessary. A dictionary of chosen words

 

is not an harangue, nor a collection of good concords a piece of music. 

A sense is wanting; an

 

union in the music as well as language is necessary: Something of what precedes must be

 

transmitted to what follows, that the whole may form a concinnity 

[skillful congruity] 

and

 

may be truly one. 

Moreover, the composed sensation, which results from a perfect concord, is

 

re-

((211))

solved in the absolute sensation of each of the sounds which compose it; and in the compared

 

sensation of each of these intervals which these same sounds form between themselves, 

there

 

is nothing beyond the sensible in this concord; from whence it follows, that it is only by the

 

connection of the sounds, and the analogy of the intervals, that the union in question can be

 

established: There lies the true and only principle, whence flow all the laws of harmony and

 

modu

lation. 

If then, the whole of 

harmony 

was formed only by a succession of per

fect major

 

concords, it would be sufficient to proceed to them by intervals simi

lar to those which

 

compose such a concord; for then, some sound of the preceding concord being necessarily

 

prolonged on the following, all the concords would be found sufficiently united, and the

 

harmony 

would be 

one, 

at least, in this sense. But besides that such successions would

 

exclude the whole melody, by excluding the diatonic genus, which forms its bass, they would

 

not reach the true aim of the art, since 

music, being a discourse, ought, like it, to have its

 

periods, its phrases, suspensions, stops, and punctuation of every kind; 

and as the uniformity

 

of the harmonic courses presents nothing of these properties, the diatonic course required the

 

major and minor concords to be intermixt, and we have felt the necessity of dissonances to

 

mark the stops and phrases. Moreover, the united succession of perfect major concords,

 

neither gives the perfect minor concord, the dissonance, or any kind of phrase, and its

 

punctuation appears entirely erroneous. Mons. Rameau, insisting absolutely, in his system,

 

that all our 

harmony 

should be drawn from nature, has had recourse, for this purpose, to

 

another experiment of his own invention. (Ibid. The author italicizes only the word 

harmony.)

Rameau’s mistake corresponds to the model of all mistakes and all his

torical perversions as

 

they 

take shape 

under Rousseau’s eyes: according to the circle, the ellipse, or the

 

unrepresentable figure of the movement of history, cold rationality and abstract convention

 

there join dead nature, the reign of physicality; a certain rationalism there mingles with

 

material-ism or sensationalism. Or empiricism: false empiricism, empiricism falsify-ing the

 

immediate givens of experience. And this falsification that misleads reason is primarily a fault

 

of the heart. If Rameau is mistaken, 36 his errings are moral faults before being theoretical

 

errors. One may read in the 

Ex

amination: 

“I shall not pretend to avow that the work entitled

 

Errors on Music 

seems to me in fact to crawl with mistakes, and that I see nothing more just

 

in it than the title. But those errors are not in M. Rameau’s reason; they have their source

 

nowhere but in the heart: and when passion does not blind him, he will judge better than

 

anyone the good rules of his art.” The aberration of the heart which drives him to persecute 37

 




Rousseau can become a theoretical error only by making him deaf to the soul of music:

 

melody and not harmony; by making him deaf—a more serious accusation—as musician as

 

much as musicographer: “I notice in the 

Errors on Music 

two of these important principles.

 

The first, which guided M.

((212))

Rameau in all his writings, and, what is worse, in all his music, is that har

mony is the unique

 

foundation of art, that melody derives from it, and that all the grand effects of music are born

 

of harmony alone (ibid.).”

Rameau’s aberration is a symptom. It betrays the sickness both of the history of the West and

 

of European ethnocentrism. For harmony ac-cording to Rousseau is a musical perversion that

 

dominates Europe (North-ern Europe) alone, and ethnocentrism consists of considering it a

 

natural and universal principle of music. The harmony that destroys the 

energy 

of music and

 

shackles its 

imitative 

force—melody—is absent in the be-ginning of music 

(in illo tempore)

 

and in non-European music 

(alibi). 

One wonders if Rousseau, conforming to a schema that

 

we now know well, does not criticize ethnocentrism by a symmetrical counter-ethnocentrism

 

and a profound Western ethnocentrism: notably by claiming that harmony is the evil and the

 

science proper to Europe. 38

The good form of music, which, through representative imitation, pro

duces sense while

 

exceeding the senses, would be melody. One must, according to the same principle of

 

dichotomy which is repeated endlessly, distinguish within melody itself a principle of life and

 

a principle of death, and hold them carefully separated one from the other. Just as there is a

 

good musical form (melody) and a bad musical form (harmony), there is a good and a bad

 

melodic form. By a dichotomous operation that one must ever begin anew and carry further,

 

Rousseau exhausts himself in trying to separate, as two exterior and heterogeneous forces, a

 

positive and a negative principle. Of course, the malign element in melody communicates

 

with the malign element of music in general, that is to say with harmony. This second

 

dissociation between good and bad melodic form puts the first exteriority into question: there

 

is harmony already within melody:

Melody 

has reference to two different principles, according to the manner in which we

 

consider it. Taken in the connection of sounds, and by the mles of the mode, 

it has its

 

principle in harmony; 

since it is an harmonic analysis which gives the degrees of the gamut

 

[scale], the chords of the mode, and the laws of the modulation, the only elements of singing.

 

According to this principle, the whole force 

of melody is 

bounded to flattering the ear by

 

agreeable sounds, as one flatters the eye by agreeable concords of colors; but when taken as

 

an art of imitation, by which the mind may be affected with different images, the heart moved

 

by different sentiments, the passions excited or calmed, in a word, moral effect be operated,

 

which surpass the immediate empire of the sense, another principle must be sought for it, for

 

we see no hold, by which the harmony alone, and whatever comes from it, can affect us thus.

 

[Dictionary, 

p. 227]




What is there to say about this second principle? It must undoubtedly permit imitation:

 

imitation alone can 

interest us 

in art, concern us by representing nature and by expressing the

 

passions. But what is it within

((213))

melody that imitates and expresses? It is the 

accent. 

If we have lingered long in the debate

 

with Rameau, it is also in order to delimit this notion of accent better. It will be indispensable

 

for us when we come to it in the theory of the relationships between speech and writing.

What is this second principle It is 

in nature 

as well as the first [I italicize: Rousseau

 

recognizes that harmony, the principle against nature, principle of death and of barbarism, is

 

also in nature], but to discover it therein, a more nice observation is necessary, tho’ more

 

simple, and a greater sensibility in the observer. This principle is the same which makes the

 

tone of the voice vary when we speak, according to the things we say, and the movements we

 

use in speaking. It is the 

accent 

of the language which determines the 

melody 

in each nation;

 

it is the 

accent 

which makes us speak while singing, and speak with 

more or less energy,

 

according as the language has more or less accent. That, whose accent is most expressed,

 

should produce a 

melody 

more lively and more passionate. That which has little or no accent,

 

can have only a cold and lan

guishing 

melody, 

without character or expression. Herein are the

 

true principles. 

[Dictionary, 

p. 

228] 

(Italics added.)

The 

Essay, 

and notably the three chapters on the origin of music, on melody, and on harmony,

 

which thus follow the order of growth, may be read according to the same pattern. But the

 

concept of the supplement is this time present in the text, 

named 

even though it is never (as it

 

no-where 

is) expounded. 

It is indeed this difference between implication, nominal presence,

 

and thematic exposition that interests us here.

The chapter on melody proposes the same definitions but it is not with-out significance that

 

the pedagogic argumentation that introduces them is totally derived from an analogy with an

 

art of space, painting. The point is first to show by this example that the science of relations is

 

cold, without imitative energy (like the calculation of intervals within harmony), while the

 

imitative expression of meaning (of passion, of the thing as it interests us) is the true living

 

content of the work. Let us not be surprised to see Rousseau place design on the side of art,

 

and colors on the side of science and the calculation of relationships. The paradox is apparent.

 

By design, one must understand condition of imitation; by color, natural substance, whose

 

physical play can be explained by physical causes and can become the object of a quantitative

 

science of relationships, of a science of space and of the analogical disposition of intervals.

 

The analogy between the two arts—music and painting—appears thus: 

it is analogy itself.

 

These two arts carry a corruptive principle, which strangely enough is also in nature, and in

 

both cases, that corruptive principle is linked to spacing, to the calculable and analogical

 

regularity of intervals. Thus, in both cases, whether music or painting, whether it is the scales

 

of music or the scales of color, the har

mony of tone as visible or audible nuance, the rational

 

calculation of har-




((214))

monics is a 

chromatic, 

if one understands that word in the larger sense, beyond what one

 

specifies with respect to the fact of the scale and the bass part in music. Rousseau does not use

 

the word in the 

Essay, 

but the analogy does not escape him in the 

Dictionary: “Chromatic,

 

[adjective sometimes taken substantively]. A kind of music which proceeds in several

 

consecutive semi-tones. This word is derived from the Greek 

chroma 

which signifies color,

 

either because the Greeks marked these notes with red characters, or differently colored; or,

 

according to authors, because the chro

matic kind is a medium between the two others, as

 

color is between black and white; or according to others, because this kind varies and

 

embellishes the diatonic by its semi-tones, which, in music, produces the same effect as the

 

colors in painting” [p. 61]. The chromatic, the 

scale [gamme], is 

to the origin of art what

 

writing is to speech. (And one will reflect on the fact that 

gamma is 

also the name of a Greek

 

letter introduced into the system of literal musical notation.) Rousseau wishes to restore a

 

natural degree of art within which chromatics, harmonics, and interval would be unknown. He

 

wishes to efface what he had 

furthermore 

(and 

elsewhere) 

already recognized, that there is

 

harmony within melody, etc. But the 

origin must (should) have been 

(such is, here and

 

elsewhere, the grammar and the lexicon of the relationship to the origin) 

pure 

melody: “The

 

first tales, the first speeches, the first laws, were in verse. Poetry was devised before prose.

 

That 

was bound to be, 

since feelings speak before reason. And so it was bound to be the same

 

with music. At first, there was no music but melody and no other melody than the varied

 

sounds of speech. Accents constituted singing.” (Italics added.) 

[Essay, pp. 50–51]

But just as in painting the art of design is degraded when the physics of color is substituted for

 

4, 39 so in the song melody is originally corrupted by harmony. Harmony is the originary

 

supplement of melody. But Rous-seau never makes explicit the originarity of the lack that

 

makes necessary the addition of the supplement—the quantity and the differences of quan

tity

 

that always already shape melody. He does not make it explicit, or rather he says it without

 

saying it, in an oblique and clandestine manner. And reading it, it must be surprised at “this

 

work of contraband,” if I may add a passage from the 

Confessions 

here. 40 In the passage of

 

the 

Essay 

that we have just cited, the definition of the origin of music was developed in this

 

way, without the contradiction or the impurity becoming its themes. “Accents constituted

 

singing, quantity constituted measure, and one spoke as much by sounds and rhythm as by

 

articulations and words. To speak and to sing were formerly one, says Strabo, which shows

 

that in his opinion poetry is the source of eloquence. 

It should be said that both had the same

 

source, 

not that they were initially the same thing. Consider-ing the way in which the earliest

 

societies were bound together, is it sur-prising that the first stories were in verse and the first

 

laws were sung? Is

((215))

it surprising that the first grammarians suboridnated their art to music and were professors of

 

both?” [Italics added; p. 51]




We shall have to relate these propositions to analogous ones, those of Vico for example. For

 

the moment I am interested in the logic proper to Rousseau’s discourse: instead of concluding

 

from this simultaneity that the song broached itself in grammar, that difference had already

 

begun to cor

rupt melody, to make both it and its laws possible at the same time, Rous-seau

 

prefers to believe that grammar 

must (should) have 

been comprised, in the sense of being

 

confused with, within melody. There 

must (should) have 

been plenitude and not lack, presence

 

without difference. From then on the dangerous supplement, scale or harmony, 

adds itself

 

from the outside as evil and lack 

to happy and innocent plenitude. It would come from an

 

outside which would be simply the outside. This conforms to the logic of identity and to the

 

principle of classical ontology (the outside is outside, being is, etc.) but not to the logic of

 

supplementarity, which would have it that the outside be inside, that the other and the lack

 

come to add them-selves as a plus that replaces a minus, that what adds itself to something

 

takes the place of a default in the thing, that the default, as the outside of the inside, should be

 

already within the inside, etc. What Rousseau in fact describes is that the lack, adding itself as

 

a plus to a plus, cuts into an energy which 

must (should) have 

been and remain intact. And

 

indeed it breaks in as a dangerous supplement, as a 

substitute 

that 

enfeebles, en-slaves,

 

effaces, separates, 

and 

falsifies: 

“Even if one spent a thousand years calculating the relations

 

of sounds and the laws of harmony, how would one ever make of that art an imitative art?

 

Where is the principle of this supposed imitation? Of what harmony is it the sign? And what

 

do chords have in common with our passions? . . . But in the process it also shackles melody,

 

draining it 

of 

energy 

and expressiveness. It 

wipes out [efface] pas

sionate accent, replacing

 

[substituer] 

it with the harmonic interval. It is restricted to only two types of songs, within

 

which its possibilities are deter-mined by the number of oral tones. It 

eliminates [efface et

 

détruit] 

many sounds or intervals which do not fit into its system. Thus in brief, it 

separates

 

singing from speech, setting these two languages against each other to their 

mutual

 

deprivation of all authenticity [vérité], so 

that it is absurd for them to occur together in a

 

pathetic subject.” (Italics added; yet once again, I emphasize particularly the strange

 

association of the values of effacement and substitution) 

[Essay, 

pp. 57-58].

What does Rousseau say without saying, see without seeing? That substi

tution has always

 

already begun; that imitation, principle of art, has always already interrupted natural

 

plenitude; that, having to be a 

discourse, 

it has always already broached presence in

 

differance; that in Nature it is always that which supplies Nature’s lack, a voice that is

 

substituted for the voice of Nature. But he says it without drawing any conclusions:

((216))

By itself, harmony is insufficient even for those expressions that seem to depend uniquely on

 

it. Thunder, murmuring waters, winds, tempests, are but poorly rendered by simple chords.

 

Whatever one does, noise alone does not speak to the spirit at all. The objects must speak in

 

order to be understood. 

In all imita

tion, some form of discourse must substitute for the voice

 

of nature. 

The musician who would represent noise by noise deceives himself. 

He knows

 

noth

ing of either the weakness or the strength of his art, 

concerning which his judg

ment is

 

tasteless and unenlightened. Let him realize that he will have to render noise in song; that to

 

produce the croaking of frogs, he will have to have them sing. 

For it is not enough to imitate

 




them; 

he must do so touchingly and pleasantly. Otherwise, his tedious imitation is nothing,

 

and will neither interest nor impress anyone. (Italics added) 

[Essay,

The Turn of Writing.

* 

We are thus brought back to discourse as supplement. And to the

 

structure of the 

Essay 

(origin of langauge, origin and degeneracy of music, degeneracy of

 

language) which reflects the struc

ture of language not only in its becoming but also in its

 

space, in its disposi

tion, in what may literally be called its 

geography.

Language is a 

structure—a 

system of oppositions of places and values—and an 

oriented

 

structure. Let us rather say, only half in jest, that 

its orientation is a disorientation. 

One will

 

be able to call it a 

polarization. 

Orientation gives direction to movement by relating it to its

 

origin as to its dawning. And it is starting from the light of origin that one thinks of the West,

 

the end and the fall, cadence or check, death or night. According to Rousseau, who

 

appropriates here a most banal opposition from the seven

teenth century, 41 language 

turns, so

 

to speak, as the earth turns. Here neither the orient nor the occident is privileged. The

 

references are to the extremities of the axis around which the globe 

turns (polos, polein) 

and

 

which is called the 

rational 

axis: the South Pole and the North Pole.

There will be neither an historical line nor an immobile picture of lan

guages. There will be a

 

turn 

(trope) of language. And this movement of culture will be both ordered and rhythmed

 

according to the most natural thing in nature: the earth and the seasons. Languages are 

sown.

 

And they themselves pass from one season to another. The division between lan

guages, the

 

apportionment in the formation of languages, between the sys

tems- turned toward the North

 

and the systems turned toward the South—that interior limit—already leaves its furrow in

 

language in general and each language in particular. Such at least is our interpretation.

 

Rousseau 

would wish 

the opposition between southern and northern in order to place a natural

 

frontier between different types of languages. However, what he 

describes 

forbids us to think

 

it. That description shows that the

xxx fotnote start xxx

•

“

Trope” in its root 

is 

“turn”; the other meaning 

of 

the French “tour” is “trick.” The title

 

could thus read “The Turning/Trope/Trick 

of 

Writing.”

xxx fotnote slutt xxx

((217))

opposition north/south being rational and not natural, structural and not factual, relational and

 

not substantial, traces an axis of reference 

inside 

each language. No language is from the

 

south or the north, no real element of the language has an absolute situation, only a

 

differential one. That is why the polar opposition does not divide a set of already existing

 

languages; it is described, though not declared, by Rousseau to be the origin of languages. We

 

must measure this gap between the description and the declaration.

What I shall loosely call the polarization of languages repeats within each linguistic system

 

the opposition that permits us to think the emergence of language from nonlanguage: the

 

opposition of passion and need and the entire series of connotative significations. Whether

 

from north or south, all language in general springs forth when passionate desire exceeds

 

physical need, when imagination 

is awakened, 

which awakens pity and gives move-ment to

 




the supplementary chain. But once languages are constituted, the polarity need/passion, and

 

the entire supplementary structure, remain op

erative within each linguistic system: languages

 

are more or less close to pure passion, that is to say more or less distant from pure need, more

 

or less close to pure language or pure nonlanguage. And the measure of that prox

imity

 

furnishes the structural principle of a classification of languages. Thus the languages of the

 

north are 

on the whole 

languages of need, the lan

guages of the south, to which Rousseau

 

devotes ten times the space in his description, are 

on the whole 

languages of passion. But this

 

description 

does not prevent Rousseau from 

declaring 

that the one group is bom of passion,

 

the other of need: the one group expresses 

first 

passion, the other expresses 

first 

need. In

 

southern countries, the first discourses were songs of love, in northern countries “the first

 

words . . . were not 

love me [aimez-moi] 

but 

help me [aidez-moi].” 

If one took this

 

declaration literally, one would have to judge it contradictory both to the descriptions and to

 

other declarations: notably to that which excludes the possibility of a language arising out of

 

pure need. But in order to be not merely apparent, these con

tradictions are regulated by the

 

desire of considering the functional or polar origin as the real and natural origin. Not being

 

able simply to accept the fact that the concept of origin has merely a relative function within a

 

system situating a multitude of origins in itself, each origin capable of being the effect or the

 

offshoot of another origin, the north capable of becoming the south for a more northern site,

 

etc., Rousseau would like the absolute origin to be an absolute south. It is in terms of this

 

diagram that the questions of fact and principle, of real and ideal origin, of genesis and

 

structure in Rousseau’s discourse must be asked anew. The diagram is un

doubtedly more

 

complex than one generally thinks.

One must here take into account the following necessities: the south is the place of origin or

 

the cradle of languages. Thus the southern languages

((218))

are closer to childhood, nonlanguage, and nature. But at the same time, being closer to the

 

origin, they are purer, more alive, more animated. On the other hand, the northern languages

 

are distant from the origin, less pure, less alive, less warm. In them one can follow the

 

progress of death and coldness. But even here, the fact that this distance takes us closer to the

 

origin is not representable. The northern languages lead back to that need, to that physicality,

 

to that nature to which the southern languages, which had just left it, were in the closest

 

possible proximity. It is always the impossible design, the unbelievable line of the

 

supplementary struc

ture. Although the difference between south and north, passion and need,

 

explains the origin of languages, it persists in the constitued languages, and at the extreme, the

 

north amounts to the south of the south, which puts the south to the north of the north. Passion

 

animates need more or less, and from the inside. Need constrains passion more or less, and

 

from the inside. This polar difference should rigorously prevent the distinction of two series

 

simply exterior to one another. But one now knows why Rousseau was anxious to maintain

 

that impossible exteriority. His text moves, then, between what. we have called 

description

 

and 

declaration, 

which are them-selves structural poles rather than natural and fixed points of

 

reference.




According to the pressing force of need persisting in passion, we shall have different types of

 

passion and therefore different types of languages. The pressure of need varies with place.

 

Place is at the same time geographi

cal situation and seasonal period. Since the difference in

 

the pressure of needs depends upon a local difference, one will not be able to distinguish the

 

question of the morphological classification of languages, which takes into account the effects

 

of need on the form of a language, from the ques

tion of the place of origin of the language,

 

typology 

from 

topology. 

One must consider 

together 

the origin of languages and the

 

difference among languages. Such that, continuing our reflection on the organization of the

 

Essay, we see Rousseau approaching this double question as one and the same question; and

 

doing so after having spoken of the definition of lan

guage in general or of primitive languages

 

in general. Chapter 8, “General and Local Difference in the Origin of Languages,” presents

 

itself thus: “All that I have said so far applies to primitive tongues in general, and to such

 

development as is due merely to the passage of time. But it does not explain either their origin

 

or their differences” [p. 30].

How does the place of origin of a language immediately mark the dif

ference proper to the

 

language? ‘What is here the privilege of the place? The locale signifies first the nature of the

 

soil and of the climate: “The principal cause that distinguishes them is local, deriving from the

 

various climates in which they are born, and the way in which they take form. It is necessary

 

to go back to this cause in order to understand the general and characteristic differences

 

between the tongues of the south and those of

((219))

the north” 

[Essay, 

p. 30]. A proposition which conforms to the promise that opens the 

Essay:

 

one must furnish a 

natural, 

nonmetaphysical, nontheo

logical explanation of the origin of

 

languages:

Speech distinguishes man among the animals; language distinguishes nations from each other;

 

one does not know where a man comes from until he has spoken. Out of usage and necessity,

 

each learns the language of his own country. But what determines that this language is that of

 

his country and not of another? In order to tell, it is necessary to go back to some principle

 

that be-longs to the locality itself and antedates its customs, for speech, being the first social

 

institution, owes its form to natural causes alone [p. 5].

To return to these natural causes is, then, to avoid the theologico-moral 

usteron proteron, 

that

 

of Condillac for example. One knows that in the second 

Discourse, 

Rousseau, while

 

recognizing his debt fully, still re

proaches Condillac for allowing himself mores and a society

 

to explain the origin of languages, especially at the moment when he professes to give a

 

purely natural explanation of what nevertheless remains in his eyes a gift of God. Rousseau

 

regrets that Condillac supposes precisely that which one must question from the beginning,

 

namely “ a sort of society already estab

lished among the inventors of language.” It is “the

 

blunder made by those who, in reasoning on the state of nature, always import into it ideas

 

gathered in a state of society” 

[Discourse, 

pp. 174-75]. On this point also, the 

Essay 

agrees

 

with the 

Discourse. 

There is no social institution before lan

guage, it is not one cultural

 

element among others, it is the element of institutions in general, it includes and constructs the

 




entire social structure. Since nothing precedes it in society, its cause can only be precultural or

 

natural. Although its essence is in the passions, its cause, which is not its essence, arises out of

 

nature, that is to say from need. And if one wants to find a precise point of juncture between

 

the second 

Discourse 

and the four chapters of the 

Essay 

dealing with the origin and the

 

differences of languages, notably in that factual content from which we have drawn the

 

argument, one should reread, in Part One of the 

Discourse, 

the page on the relationships

 

between instincts and society, between passion and need, north and south. There one would

 

see (I) that supplementarity is the structural rule (“Savage man, left by nature solely to the

 

direction of in

stinct, 

or rather indemnified for what he may lack by faculties capable at first

 

of supplying its place, and afterwards of raising him much above it, 

must accordingly begin

 

with purely animal functions” (italics added) [p. 171]; (2) that in spite of the essential

 

heterogeneity of passion and need, the former is added to the latter as an effect to a cause, a

 

product to an origin: “Whatever moralists may hold, the human understanding is greatly

 

indebted to the passions. . . . The passions, again, originate in our wants” 

[Discourse, 

p. 171];

 

(3) that Rousseau then 

makes room 

for a geographical

explanation: a structural explanation which he says can be sustained by facts; and that this

 

explanation amounts to a difference between the peoples of the north and those of the south,

 

the former receiving a supple-ment to fulfill a lack that the latter do not suffer. And when

 

Chapter 8 of the 

Essay 

announces its considerations of the differences in this way: “Let us try

 

to follow the order of nature in our investigations. I shall enter now upon a long digression on

 

a subject so hackneyed it is trivial, but one to which it is nonetheless always necessary to

 

return, in order to find the origin of human institutions” [p. 31], one can imagine the placing

 

of a long footnote to this passage of the 

Discourse 

(Rousseau is explaining that “the passions

 

in their turn draw their origin from our needs”) :

It would be easy, were it necessary, to support this opinion by facts, and to show that, in all

 

the nations of the world, the progress of the understanding has been exactly proportionate to

 

the wants which the peoples had received from nature, or been subjected to by circumstances,

 

and in consequence to the passions that induced them to provide for those necessities. I might

 

instance the arts, rising up in Egypt and expanding with the inundation of the Nile. I might

 

follow their progress into Greece, where they took root afresh, grew up and towered to the

 

skies, among the rocks and sands of Attica, without being able to germinate on the fertile

 

banks of the Eurotas: I might observe that in general, the people of the North are more

 

industrious than those of the South, because they cannot get on so well without being so: 

as if

 

nature wanted to equalize matters by giving their understandings the fertility she had refused

 

to their soil 

(pp. 143—44 [171—72]; italics added).

There is, then, an economy of nature which attends to the regulating of faculties according to

 

needs, and distributes supplements and compensa

tions. This supposes that the sphere of

 

necessity is itself complex, hier

archized, differentiated. It is in this sense that we should relate

 

to all such texts Chapter 8 of Book III of 

The Social Contract;* 

the influence of 

De l’esprit

 

des Loix ** 

upon the chapter has been noticed; an entire theory of the 

excess 

of the production

 

of work according to need systematically dove-tails with a typology of the forms of

 

government (according to “the dis-tance between people and government”) and with an

 

explanation by cli

mate (according to whether one goes away from or “nearer . . . to the

 

equator”) : “We find then, in every climate, natural causes according to which the form of

 

government which it requires can be assigned, and we can even say what sort of inhabitants it

 

should have” 

[Social Contract, 

p. 65].

((221))

But the theory of needs that underlies the 

Essay is 

set forth, perhaps bet-ter than elsewhere, in

 

a fragment of five pages, whose inspiration is unde

niably that of the chapters that interest us

 

and undoubtedly also that of the project of the 

Political Institutions. 42 

Three sorts of needs

 

are dis

tinguished there: those that “deal with subsistence” and “with preserva

tion”

 

(nourishment, sleep); those that deal with “well-being,” which are “properly speaking no

 

more than appetites, but sometimes so violent that they torment more than true needs”

 

(“luxury of sensuality, of softness, the union of sexes and all that flatter our senses”) : “a third

 

order of needs which, born after the others, do not allow them to take precedence, are those

 

that arise from public opinion.” The first two must be satisfied for the last to appear, Rousseau

 

notes, but we have observed that 

the second or secondary need supplants each time, by force

 

or urgency, the first need. There is already a perversion of needs, an inversion of their natural

 

order. 

And we have just seen included among needs what is elsewhere named passion. Need

 

is thus permanently present within passion. But if one wants to be aware of the first origin of

 

passion, society, and language, one must return to the profundity of the needs of the first

 

order. Our fragment thus defines the program of the 

Essay, 

which it proceeds to flesh out in a

 

few pages:

Thus all reduces itself at first to subsistence, and in that respect man is a func

tion of his

 

environment. He depends on everything and he becomes what every-thing he depends upon

 

forces him to be. Climate, soil, air, water, productions of the earth and sea, form his

 

temperament, his character, determine his tastes, his passions, his work, his actions of all

 

kinds. [The natural explanation is not good for the atoms of culture but for the total social

 

fact:] If that is not exactly true of individuals, it is undeniably true of peoples. . . . Thus before

 

one broaches the history of our species, one must begin by examining its habitation and all its

 

varieties (p. 530) .

The explanation by the natural locale is not a static one. It takes into account the natural

 

revolutions: seasons and migrations. Rousseau’s dy

namic is a strange system within which the

 

critique of ethnocentrism organically comes to terms with a Europeocentrism. It is better

 

under-stood by carefully weaving together a piece of 

Emile 

and a piece of the 

Essay. 

It is then

 

seen how the concept of 

culture, 

in a very rare usage, unites nature and society by virtue of its

 

metaphoricity. In the 

Essay 

as in 

Emile, 

the changes of place and seasons, the displacements

 

of man and terrestrial revolutions are taken care of by the natural explanation. But if that ex-

planation is preceded, in the 

Essay, 

by a protestation against European prejudice, it is

 

followed, in 

Emile, 

by a Europeocentric profession of faith. As the protestation and the

 




profession of faith have not the same function and are not on the same level, and as they do

 

not contradict each other, we

((222))

will profit by recomposing their system. Let us first place the texts side by side:

The 

Essay:

The great shortcoming of Europeans is always to philosophize on the origins of things

 

exclusively in terms of what happens within their own milieu. They never fail to show us

 

primitive men inhabiting a barren and harsh world, dying of cold and hunger, desperate for

 

shelter and clothing, with nothing in sight but Europe’s ice and snow. But they fail to realize

 

that, just like all life, the human race originated in warm climes, and that on two-thirds of the

 

globe, winter is hardly known. When one wants to study men, one must consider those around

 

one. But to study man, one must extend the range of one’s vision. One must first observe the

 

differences in order to discover the properties. The human race, born in warm lands, spread

 

itself into cold areas where it multiplied, and then coursed back into the warm lands. From

 

this action and reaction come the revolutions of the earth and the continual agitation of its

 

inhabitants (Chap. 8) [PP. 30-31].

Emile:

The birthplace is not a matter of indifference in the 

education [culture] 

of man; 

it is only in

 

temperate climes that he comes to his full growth. 

The disad

vantages of extremes are easily

 

seen. 

A man is not planted in one place like a tree, to stay there the rest of his life, 

and to pass

 

from one extreme to another you must travel twice as far as he who starts half-way.... A

 

Frenchman can live in New Guinea or in Lapland, but a negro cannot live in Tornea nor a

 

Samoyed in Benin. It seems also as if the brain were less perfectly organized in the two

 

extremes. Neither the negroes nor the Laps are as wise as Europeans. So if I want my pupil to

 

be a citizen of the world I will choose him in the temperate zone, in France for example,

 

rather than elsewhere.

In the north with its barren soil men devour much food, in the fertile south they eat little. This

 

produces another difference: the one is industrious, the other contemplative (p. 

27; 

italics

 

added) [p. 20].

How do these two apparently contradictory texts complement each other? We shall see below

 

how culture is linked to agriculture. It appears here that man, in as much as he depends upon a

 

soil and a climate, 

is culti

vated: 

he sprouts, he forms a society and “The birthplace is not a

 

matter of indifference in the education 

[culture] 

of man.” But this culture is also the power of

 

changing terrain, of opening oneself to another culture: man may look far, “he is not planted

 

in one place like a tree,” he is engaged, both texts say, in migrations and revolutions. From

 

that perspective, one may criticize ethnocentrism in as much as it shuts us in within a locality

 

and an empirical culture: the European makes the mistake of not traveling, of deeming

 

himself the immobile center of the world, of resting planted like a tree in his own country. But

 




this criticism of the empirical Europe should not prevent us from recognizing, Rousseau

 

seems to think, that

((223))

the European, by his natural locality, occupying the middle between ex

tremes, has a greater

 

facility for traveling, for opening himself to the horizon and diversity of universal culture. At

 

the center of the world, the European has the luck or power to be European and everything

 

else at the same time. (“It is only in temperate climates that he [man] comes to his full growth

—“) He is simply wrong in not using this universal opening 

in fact.

All this argumentation circulates between the two Europes; it has re

mained or become classic.

 

We shall not examine it here for its own sake: let us only consider that it is the condition of all

 

Rousseau’s discourse. If, in his eyes, there were no unlocking of a determined culture, no

 

opening into all other cultures in general, no mobility and possibility of imaginary variations,

 

these questions would remain closed. Better, it would be impos

sible :o determine difference.

 

Difference only appears starting from a certain middle point, a certain median, mobile and

 

temperate, between north and south, need and passion, consonant and accent, etc. Under the

 

factual determination of this temperate zone (Europe, “in France, for example, rather than

 

elsewhere”), birthplace of the anthropologist and of the citizen of the world, an essential

 

necessity is concealed: it is 

between 

different things that one can think difference. But this

 

difference-between may be understood in two ways: as another difference or as access to

 

nondifference. It is not at all doubtful for Rousseau that the inhabitant of the temperate zone

 

should 

make of his difference, effacing it or surmounting it in an in

terested in-difference, an

 

opening to the humanity of man. Pedagogical success and ethnological humanism would have

 

the good fortune of pro

ducing itself in Europe, “in France, for example, rather than

 

elsewhere,” in that happy region of the world where man is neither warm nor cold.

From this privileged place of observation, one will better dominate the play of oppositions,

 

order, and the predominance of extremes. One will better understand the natural causes of

 

culture. Since language is not an element but the element of culture, one must first locate,

 

both in the language and in nature, the oppositions of corresponding and interarticu

lated

 

values. What, within language, must correspond to the predominance of need, that is to say

 

the north? Consonant or articulation. To the pre-dominance of passion, that is to say of the

 

south? Accent or inflection.

The play of predominances would be inexplicable if one held to the simple proposition

 

according to which languages are bom of passion (Chap-ter 3). In order that need may come

 

to dominate passion in the north, an inversion or perversion must already be possible within

 

the order of need and of a need that is forever related to passion, arousing it, persevering in it,

 

submitting to it or controlling it. The appeal to the second 

Discourse 

and to the 

Fragment 

was

 

thus indispensable. It permits us to explain this affirmation of the 

Essay: 

“Eventually all men

 

became similar, but the order




((224))

of their progress is different. In southern climes, where nature is bountiful, needs are born of

 

passion. In cold countries, where she is miserly, passions are born of need, and the languages,

 

sad daughters of necessity, reflect their austere origin” (Chap. 10) 

[Essay, 

p. 

46].

Now if the predominance of the North Pole over the South, of need over passion, of

 

articulation over accent, is in fact 

gradual, 

it nonethe

less has the sense of 

substitution. 

As we

 

have often shown, progressive effacement is also the installation of a supplementary

 

substitute. The man of the North substituted 

help-me [aidez-moi] 

for 

love-me [aimez-moi],

 

clarity for energy, articulation for accent, reason for heart. Formal substitu

tion undoubtedly

 

conveys a weakening of energy, of warmth, of life, of passion, but it remains a transformation,

 

a revolution in form and not only a diminishing of force. An explanation of this substitution in

 

terms of a simple degradation is most inadequate; it so strongly implies a displace-ment and

 

an inversion that it refers us to a completely different function of need. In the 

normal 

order of

 

origin (in the South), the proposition of Chapter 2 

(That the first invention of speech is due

 

not to need but to passions 

and “the natural effect of the first needs was to separate men, and

 

not to reunite them”) has an absolutely general value. But this normal order of origin is

 

reversed in the North. The North is not simply the dis

tanced other of the South, it is not the

 

limit that one reaches if he starts out from the unique southern origin. Rousseau is in a way

 

compelled to recognize that the North is also 

another origin. 

It is to death that he accords this

 

status, because the absolute North is death. Normally need isolates men instead of bringing

 

them closer; in the North, it is the origin of society:

The idleness that nurtures passion 

is replaced by work, which represses it. 

Be-fore being

 

concerned with living happily, one had to be concerned with living. Mutual need uniting men

 

to a greater extent when sentiment has not done so, society would be formed only through

 

industry. The ever-present danger of perishing would not permit a language restricted to

 

gesture. And, the first words among them were not 

love me [aimez-moi] 

but 

help me [aidez-

moi] .

These two expressions, although similar enough, are pronounced in a very 

different 

tone. The

 

whole point was not to make someone 

feel 

something, but to make him 

understand. 

Thus

 

what was needed was not 

vigor [énergie] 

but 

clarity. 

For the 

accents 

which the heart does not

 

provide, distinct 

articulation is substituted. 

And if some trace of nature remains in the form of

 

the language, this too contributes to its austerity. (Italics added.)

In the north, the passions do not disappear: there is substitution, not effacement. The passions

 

are not extenuated but 

repressed 

by what takes the place of desire: work. Work represses more

 

than it lessens the forcé of desire. It displaces it. That is why “Northern men are not

 

passionless, but

((225))

their passions are, in effect, of another kind” 

[Essay, 

p. 48] : ,anger, irrita

tion, fury,

 

disquietude are the displacements of southern passion. In the south, passion is not repressed,

 

whence a certain softness, a certain intem

perance for which people in tempered regions do not

 

have an unreserved indulgence:




The passions of the warm countries are voluptuous, relating to love and tenderness. Nature

 

does so much for people there that they have almost nothing to do. Provided that an Asiatic

 

has women and repose, he is contented. But in the north, where people consume a great deal,

 

on barren soil, men are easily irritated, being subject to so many needs. Anything happening

 

near them dis

turbs them. As they subsist only through effort, the poorer they are the more

 

firmly they hold to the little they have. To approach them is to threaten their lives. This is

 

what accounts for their irascible temper, their quickness to attack anyone who offends them.

 

Thus too their most natural tone of voice is angry and menacing, and their words are always

 

accompanied by 

emphatic articulation, 

which makes them harsh and loud. . . . These, in my

 

opinion are the most general physical causes of the characteristic differences of the primitive

 

tongues. Those of the south are bound to be 

lively, sonorous, accented, eloquent, 

and

 

frequently 

obscure. because of their power. 

Those of the north are bound to be 

dull, harsh,

 

articulated, shrill, monotonous, 

and to have a 

clarity due more to vocabulary than to good

 

construction. 

The modern tongues, with all their inter-mingling and recasting, still retain

 

something of these differences. (Chap.10, 11. Italics added.) [pp. 48—49]

The pole of linguistic articulation is in the north. Articulation (difference within language) is

 

thus not a simple effacement; it does not tone down the energy either of desire or of the

 

accent. It displaces and represses desire by work. It is not the sign of a weakening of force, in

 

spite of what Rousseau sometimes seems to make us think, but it conveys, on the contrary, a

 

con

flict of antagonistic forces, a difference within the force. The force of need, its own

 

economy, that which makes work necessary, works precisely against the force of desire and

 

represses it, breaking its song into articulation.

This conflict of forces responds to an economy that is no longer simply that of need, but the

 

system of the relations of force between desire and need. Here two forces that one may

 

indifferently consider forces of life or of death are opposed. Responding to the urgency of

 

need, the man of the north protects his life not only against penury but against the death that

 

would follow the unrestrained liberation of southern desire. He protects himself against the

 

menace of voluptuousness. But conversely, he fights against this force of death with another

 

force of death. From this point of view, it appears that life, energy, desire, etc., are of the

 

South. The northern language is less alive, less animated, less song-like, colder. To fight

 

against..

((226))

death, the man of the North dies a little earlier and “it is known . . . that northern peoples do

 

not die singing any more than swans do” (Chap. 14) [P. 58].

Writing is at the North: cold, necessitous, reasoning, turned toward death, to be sure, but by

 

that 

tour de force, 

by that detour of force which forces it to hold on to life. In fact, the more a

 

language is articulated, the more articulation extends its domain, and thus gains in rigor and in

 

vigor, the more it yields to writing, the more it calls writing forth. This is the central thesis of

 

the Essay. The progress of history, the degradation which unites with it according to the

 

strange graphic of supplementarity, goes toward the North and toward death: history effaces

 




vowel accent, or rather represses it, hollows out articulation, extends the power of writing.

 

That is why the ravages of writing are more felt in the modern languages:

The modern tongues, with all their intermingling and recasting, still retain something of these

 

differences. French, English, German: each is a language private to a group of men who help

 

each other, reason together calmly, or who become angry. But the ministers of the gods

 

proclaiming sacred mysteries, sages giving laws to their people, leaders swaying the

 

multitude, have to speak Arabic or Persian. 

43

 

Our tongues are better suited to writing than

 

speaking, 

and there is more pleasure in reading us than in listening to us. Oriental tongues, on

 

the other hand, lose their life and warmth when they are written. The words do not conyey

 

half the meaning: all the effectiveness is in the tone of voice 

[accents]. 

Judging the genius of

 

the Orientals from their books is like painting a man’s portrait from his corpse (Chap. i i;

 

italics added) [P. 49].

The oriental corpse is in the book. Ours is already in our speech. Our language, even if we are

 

pleased to speak it, has already substituted too many articulations for too many accents, it has

 

lost life and warmth, it is already eaten by writing. Its accentuated features have been gnawed

 

through by the consonants.

Although it was not the only degree of articulation for Rousseau, the fragmentation of

 

language into words had already cancelled the energy of the accent (by using that verb—“to

 

cancel” 

[biffer]—we 

leave the values of effacement and erasure, of extenuation and

 

repression, in their ambiguity, as Rousseau proposes them simultaneously). The languages of

 

the North are “clear because of the power of words”; in the languages of the South, “the

 

meaning is only half in the words, all the force is in the accents.”

Cancellation amounts to producing a supplement. But as always, the supplement is

 

incomplete, unequal to the task, it lacks something in order for the lack to be filled, it

 

participates in the evil that it should repair. The loss of accent is inadequately compensated for

 

by articulation: the latter is “strong,” “hard,” and “noisy,” it does not sing. And when writing

 

tries to supplement accent by accents, it is nothing but make-up dissimulating the corpse of

 

the accent. Writing—here the inscribing of accents—not only

((227))

hides language under its artifice, it masks the already decomposed corpse of language. “We

 

[moderns] have no idea of a sonorous and harmonious language, spoken as much according to

 

sounds as it is according to words. It is mistaken to think that accent marks can 

make up for

 

[suppléer] 

oral intonation 

[l’accent]. 

One invents accent signs 

[accens] 

only when intona

tion

 

[l’accent] 

has already been lost” 44 (Chap. 7; italics added) [Essay, pp. 24—25]. Accents are,

 

like punctuation, an evil of writing: not only an invention of 

copyists 

but of copyists who are

 

strangers 

to the language which they transcribe; the copyist or his reader is by definition a

 

stranger to the living use of language. They always deal with a moribund speech in order to

 

camouflage it: “When the Romans began to study Greek, the copyists invented signs for

 

accent marks, aspiration marks, and marks of prosody, to indicate their pronunciation. But by

 

no means does it follow that these signs were in use among the Greeks, who would not need

 




them” [Essay, pp. 29—30 n.]. For obvious reasons, Rousseau was of necessity fasci

nated by

 

the person of the copyist. Especially but not only within the musical order, the moment of

 

transcription is the dangerous moment, as is the moment of writing, which in a way is already

 

a transcription, the imita

tion of other signs; reproducing the signs, producing the signs of

 

signs, the copyist is always tempted to add 

supplementary 

signs to improve the restitu

tion of

 

the original. The good copyist must resist the temptation of the supplementary sign. He must

 

rather show himself economical in the use of signs. In the admirable article “copyist” in the

 

Dictionary 

of 

Music, 

with the minuteness and volubility of an artisan explaining his craft to

 

the ap

prentice, Rousseau advises “never to write useless notes,” “not to multiply signs in a

 

useless way.” 45

Punctuation is the best example of a nonphonetic mark within writing. Its impotence in

 

transcribing accent and inflexion isolates or analyses the misery of writing reduced to its

 

proper means. Unlike Duclos, 

46

 who yet inspires him, here Rousseau accuses, rather than the

 

essence of punctuation, the imperfect state in which it has been left: a vocative mark must be

 

invented to “distingiush a man named from a man called.” And even a mark of irony. For

 

while distrusting writing, and indeed because of that distrust, Rousseau wants to exhaust all

 

its univocity, clarity, precision. These values are negative when they chill the expression of

 

passion; but they are positive when they avoid trouble, ambiguity, hypocrisy, and the

 

dissimula

tion of the original spoken word or song. The 

Dictionary 

of 

Music 

recom

mends

 

“exactness of the connections” and “a neatness in our signs” (article on copyist) [copiste; p.

 

96].

The difference between accent or intonation on the one hand and accents on the other thus

 

separates speech and writing as quality and quantity, force and spacing. “Our professed

 

accents are nothing but vowels, or signs of quantity; they mark no variety of sound.” Quantity

 

is linked to articula-

((228))

tion. Here to the articulation into sounds and not, as immediately above, to articulation into

 

words. Rousseau is aware of what André Martinet calls the 

double articulation 

of language:

 

into sounds and into words. The opposition of “vowels” or “voice” to accent or “diversity of

 

sounds” evi

dently presupposes that the vowel is not pure voice, but a voice that has already

 

undergone the differential work of articulation. Voice and vowel are not opposed here, to the

 

consonant, as they are in another context.

The entire Chapter 7, “On Modern Prosody,” which criticizes French grammarians and plays a

 

decisive role in the 

Essay, is 

strongly inspired by Duclos. The borrowings are declared,

 

massive, determining. Given the architectonic importance of this chapter, it is difficult to

 

believe that the borrowings from Duclos were inserted after the fact.

But, furthermore, is it a matter of borrowing? As usual, Rousseau makes the borrowed pieces

 

play within an absolutely original organization. Of course he cites and recites such and such a

 

passage from the “Commentary” (Chapter 4) here and there. Even when he is not actually

 




quoting, he draws from passages like the following, which, with many others, would

 

anticipate a similar Saussurian development (supra, p. 57, 38-39).

The superstition of etymology gives rise to as many inconsistencies in its small domain, as

 

superstition properly speaking does in graver matters. Our orthog

raphy is an assemblage of

 

bizarrerie and contradictions. . . . Yet, whatever care one took in noting our prosody, beside

 

the unpleasantness of seeing print bristling with signs, I have strong doubts that that would be

 

of much use. There are things which can only be learnt through usage; they are purely organic

 

and give so little foothold to reason, that it would be impossible to grasp them by theory

 

alone, which is faulty even in the authors who expressly deal with them. I sense even that

 

what I write here is very difficult to make comprehensible, and that it would be very clear, if I

 

explained it in my person (pp. 414-15).

But Rousseau keeps an eye on his borrowings, reinterprets them, and applies himself to

 

enhancing their value in a manner to which we must pay heed. He insists, for example, upon

 

the notion that the accent is 

cancelled 

by the sign and the use of the spoken word by the

 

artifice of writing. Can-celled by a work of erasure and replacement, obliterated rather than

 

for-gotten, toned down, devalued. “According to M. Duclos, ‘all the ancient prosodic signs

 

supposed a quite fixed function, not yet bowing to usage.’ I would add that they substituted

 

for it” 

[Essay, 

p. 27]. And Rousseau’s entire argument follows the history of the accentuation

 

or of the punctua

tion superadded to the primitive Hebraic language.

The conflict then is between the force of accentuation and the force of articulation. This

 

concept of articulation must stop us here. It had served to define arche-writing as it is already

 

at work within speech. And Saussure, in contradiction to his phonologist thesis, recognized,

 

we recall, that the power of articulation alone—and not spoken language—was “natural to

((229))

man.” Being the condition of speech, does articulation itself not remain a-phasic?

Rousseau introduces the concept of articulation in Chapter 4, “On the Distinctive

 

Characteristics of the First Language and the Changes It Had to Undergo.” The first three

 

chapters deal with the origin of languages. Chapter 5 will be entitled “On Script.”

 

Articulation is the becoming-writing of language. 

Rousseau, 

who would like to say 

that this

 

becoming-writing 

comes upon the origin unexpectedly, 

takes it as his premise, and according

 

to it 

describes in fact 

the way in which that 

becoming-writing encroaches upon the origin, 

and

 

arises from the origin. The becoming-writing of lan

guage is the becoming-language of

 

language. He 

declares 

what he 

wishes to say, 

that is to say that articulation and writing are a

 

post-originary malady of language; he says or 

describes 

that which he 

does not wish to say:

 

articulation and therefore the space of writing operates at the origin of language.

Like those of imitation—and for the same profound reasons—the value and operation of

 

articulation are ambiguous: principles of life 

and 

princi

ples of death, and therefore the motive

 

forces of progress in the sense that Rousseau gives to that word. He 

would like to say 

that

 

progress, however ambivalent, occurs 

either 

toward the worse, 

or 

toward the better, either for

 




better or for worse. The first chapter of the 

Essay 

shows in effect, according to a concept of

 

animal language which some hold even today, that the 

natural 

languages of the animals

 

exclude progress. “Conventional language is characteristic of man alone. That is why man

 

makes progress, whether for good or ill, and animals do not” 

[Essay, p. 10

].

But Rousseau 

describes what he does not wish to say: 

that “progress” takes place 

both 

for the

 

worse 

and 

for the better. At the same time. Which annuls eschatology and teleology, just as

 

difference—or originary articula

tion—annuls archeology.

III. Articulation

All this appears in the handling of the concept of articulation. To demon-strate it we must

 

make a long detour. To understand how “articulations, which are conventional” (Chapter 4),

 

operate, we must once again go through the problem of the concept of nature. To avoid

 

rushing directly into the center of the difficulty which many commentators on Rousseau have

 

already well defined, we shall try, in a limited and prefatory way, to locate it in the 

Essay.

 

Already there it is formidable.

“

That Movement of the Wand . . .”

 

Let us begin with some simple cer

tainties and choose

 

some propositions whose literal clarity leaves little in doubt. We read them in the first chapter.

First propostion. 

“

Speech distinguishes man among the animals.” These

((230))

are the first words of the 

Essay. 

Speech is also “the first social institution.” It is therefore not

 

natural. It is natural to man, it belongs to his nature, to his essence, which is not, unlike that of

 

animals, natural.

Speech belongs to man, to the humanity of man. But Rousseau dis

tinguishes between

 

language 

[langue] 

and speech 

[parole]. 

The usage of speech is universally human but

 

languages are diverse. “Language dis

tinguishes nations from each other; one does not know

 

where a man comes from until he has spoken. Out of usage and necessity, each learns the lan

-

guage of his own country. But what determines that this language is that of his country and

 

not of another? In order to tell, it is necessary to go back to some principle that belongs to the

 

locality itself and antedates its customs, for speech, being the first social institution, owes its

 

form to natural causes alone” 

[Essay, 

p. 5]. Thus the natural causality of language splits itself

 

in two.

1. Speech, the possibility of discourse in general, must have, as the first institution, only

 

general 

natural causes (relationships between need and passion, etc.) .

2. But beyond the general existence of speech, one must account, by equally natural causes,

 

for its 

forms 

(“speech, being the first social institu

tion, owes its form to natural causes

 

alone”). It is the explication of the diversity of languages by physicality, geography, climate,

 

etc. This double natural explanation announces the division of the 

Essay 

in its first part, into

 




what concerns language and what concerns languages. The first seven chapters explain by

 

natural causes language in general (or the primitive language), its origin, and its decadence.

 

With the eighth chapter, we pass from language to languages. General and local differences

 

are explained by natural causes.

How should this natural explanation be analyzed?

Second proposition: 

“As soon as one man was recognized by another as a sentient, thinking

 

being similar to himself, the desire or need to communi

cate his feelings and thoughts made

 

him seek the means to do so” 

[Essay, 

p. 5]. Desire 

or 

need; the home of two origins, southern

 

or northern, is already assured. And Rousseau refuses, as he also does in the second 

Dis-

course, 

to wonder if the language preceded the society as its condition, or conversely. He sees

 

no solution, and no doubt no sense, to such a question. In the second 

Discourse, 

confronted by

 

the immense difficulty of the genealogy of language, almost giving up a natural and purely

 

human expla

nation, Rousseau writes what is also implied in the 

Essay: 

“For myself, I am so

 

aghast at the increasing difficulties which present themselves, and so well convinced of the

 

almost demonstrable impossibility that languages should owe their original institution to

 

merely human means, that I leave, to any one who will undertake it, the discussion of the

 

difficult problem, which was most necessary, the existence of society to the invention of

((231))

language, or the invention of language to the establishment of society” (p. 151) [P. 179]•

Same gesture in the 

Essay: 

one is given language and society at the same time, at the moment

 

when the pure state of nature is crossed, when ab-solute dispersion is overcome for the first

 

time. One attempts to seize the origin of language at the moment of this first crossing over. In

 

the second 

Discourse, 

we can still locate a footnote reference: a place is indicated for that

 

long digression which would have been the 

Essay. 

It is in the first part, immediately after the

 

critique of Condillac and of those who, “reasoning from the state of nature, transport there

 

ideas taken from society.” Rous-seau knows that it is very difficult to find the resource of an

 

explanation for the birth of languages in the pure state of nature and in the original dis

persion.

 

And he proposes a leap: “We will suppose, however, that this first difficulty is obviated. Let

 

us for a moment then take ourselves as being on this side of the vast space which must lie

 

between a pure state of nature and that in which languages had become necessary, and,

 

admitting their necessity, let us inquire how they could first be established. Here we have a

 

new and worse difficulty to grapple with” (p. 14) [p. 175].

“

Let us for a moment then take ourselves as being on this side of the vast space.” Up to what

 

point? Not up to constituted society but up to the moment when the conditions for its birth are

 

united. Between the pure state of nature and that moment—“a multitude of centuries,”

 

rhythmed by distinct steps. 47 But it is difficult to discern the stages. The difference among all

 

Rousseau’s texts is subtle, perhaps unstable, always problematic on this point. To the

 

distinctions already located, we must, at the risk of compli

cating the debate, add the following

 

specification, which concerns precisely the 

Essay 

in its relationship to the 

Discourse. 

Between

 

the pure state of nature and society, Rousseau describes, both in the 

Discourse 

and in the

 




Essay, 

an age of huts. And since that age is presented in Chapter 9 of the 

Essay 

as the

 

“primitive times,” one might be tempted to think that the pure state of nature is radically

 

situated only in the second 

Discourse 

(first part), the age of huts of the 

Essay 

corresponding to

 

the one that appeared after the pure state of nature in the second part of the 

Discourse. 

Even

 

though this hypothesis does not seem simply false and is in fact confirmed by many

 

descriptive elements, it must be nuanced or complicated. As it is evoked in the 

Essay, 

the age

 

of huts is much closer to the pure state of nature. Speaking of “primitive times,” when “the

 

sparse human population had no more social structure than the family, no laws but those of

 

nature, no language but that of gesture and some inarticulate sounds,” Rousseau adds in a

 

note: “I consider primitive the period of time from the dispersion of men to any period of the

 

human race that might be taken as determining an epoch” 

[Essay, 

p. 31, n. 1]. And certainly

 

familial societies do not have the same status here as in the second part of the 

Discourse 48

 

The two

((232))

accounts become similar, it seems, only at the moment when, after a revo

lution that we shall

 

examine later, ties of another family are constituted, making possible love, morality, speech. It

 

is only the close of Chapter 9 of the 

Essay 

that one may compare to the second part of the

 

Discourse.

“

Let us for a moment then take ourselves as being on this side of the vast space . . .” and give

 

ourselves the following hypothesis: starting from the state of pure nature, thanks to a certain

 

reversal that we shall discuss later, man encounters man and recognizes him. Pity awakens

 

and becomes active, he wishes to communicate. But at that moment man has just left nature. It

 

is still by natural causes that the means of communication must be explained. Man can at first

 

use only natural dispositions or “instru

ments”: the senses.

Third proposition. 

Man must therefore act by his senses upon the senses of others. “Hence the

 

institution of sensate signs for the expression of thought. The inventors of language did not

 

proceed rationally in this way; rather their instinct suggested the consequence of them”

 

[Essay, 

p. 5]. We have two ways of working on the senses of others: movement and voice.

 

Naturally, Rousseau does not wonder what “means” or “instrument” might mean, nor, as he

 

does in 

Emile (p. 16o), 

if voice is not itself a sort of move-ment. “The action of movement is

 

immediate through touching, or mediate through gesture. The first can function only within

 

arm’s length, while the other extends as far as the visual ray. Thus vision and hearing are the

 

only passive organs of language among 

distinct [dispersés] 

individuals” 

(Essay, 

p. 

6) 

(italics

 

added).

The analysis of the “instruments” of language is therefore governed by the situation of pure

 

dispersion which characterizes the state of nature. Language could have emerged only out of

 

dispersion. The “natural causes” by which one explains it are not recognized as natural except

 

in so far as they accord with the state of nature, which is determined by dispersion. This

 

dispersion should no doubt be overcome by language but, for that very reason, it determines

 

the 

natural condition 

of language.




The natural condition: it is remarkable that the original dispersion out of which language

 

began continues to mark its milieu and essence. That language must traverse space, be obliged

 

to be spaced, is not an accidental trait but the mark of its origin. In truth, dispersion will never

 

be a past, a prelinguistic situation in which language would certainly have been bom only to

 

break with it. The original dispersion leaves its mark within lan

guage. We shall have to verify

 

it: articulation, which seemingly introduces difference as an institution, has for ground and

 

space the dispersion that is natural: space itself.

At this point, the concept of nature becomes even more enigmatic and if one does not want

 

Rousseau to contradict himself at all, one must use a great deal of analysis and sympathy.

((233))

The natural is first valorized and then disqualified: the original is also the inferior retained

 

within the superior. The language of gesture and the language of voice, sight and hearing, are

 

“equally natural.” Nevertheless, one is more natural than the other and because of this it is

 

first and better. It is the language of gesture, which is “more easy and depends less on

 

conventions.” Of course there can be conventions of the language of gestures. Rousseau

 

alludes later to a gestural code. But that code is less remote from nature than is the spoken

 

language. For that reason, Rousseau begins with praise for the language of gestures although,

 

further on, wishing to show the superiority of passion over need, he will place speech above

 

gesture. This contradiction is only apparent. Natural immediacy is at once origin and end, but

 

in the double sense of these words: birth and death, un-finished sketch and finished

 

perfection. From then on, all value is deter-mined according to its proximity to an absolute

 

nature. But as this concept is that of a polarized structure, proximity is a distancing. All the

 

contradic

tions of the discourse are 

regulated, 

rendered necessary yet resolved, by this

 

structure of the concept of nature. 

Before all determinations of a natural law, there is,

 

effectively constraining the discourse, a law of the concept of nature.

A contradiction regulated in this way appears in a flagrant manner when, praising the

 

language of gesture, Rousseau speaks of love. Further on, he will say of this passion that it is

 

at the origin of sung speech; here, he makes drawing its best interpreter. To appeal to the eye

 

in order to declare love is more natural, more expressive, more 

alive: 

at once more immediate

 

and more alive, therefore more energetic, more present, more free. Thus 

resolving 

the entire

 

contradiction, summing it up into its two poles, the 

Essay 

begins with praise and concludes

 

with condemnation of the mute sign. The first chapter exalts language without voice, that of

 

glance and gesture (which Rousseau distinguishes from our gesticulation) : “Thus one speaks

 

more effectively to the eye than to the ear” 

[Essay, 

p. 

8]. 

The last chapter depicts, at the other

 

pole of history, the ultimate servitude of a society organized by the circulation of silent signs:

 

“Societies have as

sumed their final form: no longer is anything changed except by arms and

 

cash. And since there is nothing to say to people besides 

give money, 

it is said with placards

 

on street corners or by soldiers in their homes” 

[Essay, 

p. 72].

The mute sign is a sign of liberty when it expresses within immediacy; then, what it expresses

 

and he who expresses himself through it are 

properly 

present. There is neither detour nor

 

anonymity. The mute sign signifies slavery when re-presentative mediacy has invaded the

 




entire system of sig

nification: then, through infinite circulation and references, from sign to

 

sign and from representer to representer, the selfsameness 

[propre] 

of presense has no longer

 

a place: no one is there for anyone, not even for himself; one

((234))

can no longer dispose of meaning; one can no longer stop it, it is carried into an endless

 

movement of signification. The system of the sign has no outside. As it is speech that has

 

opened this endless movement 

[l’abîme] 

of signification—thus constantly risking the loss of

 

signification—it is tempting to return to an archeological moment, a first moment of sign

 

without speech, when passion, beyond need but short of articulation and difference, expresses

 

itself in an unheard of way: an 

immediate sign:

Although the language of gesture and spoken language are equally natural, still the first is

 

easier 49 and depends less upon conventions. For more things affect our eyes than our ears.

 

Also, visual forms are more varied than sounds, and more expressive, saying more in less

 

time. Love, it is said, was the inventor of drawing. It might also have invented speech, though

 

less happily. Not being very well pleased with it, it disdains it; it has livelier ways of

 

expressing itself. How she could say things to her beloved, who traced his shadow with such

 

pleasure! What sounds might she use to render this movement of the magic wand? [Essay, p.

 

6]

The movement of the magic wand that traces with so much pleasure does not fall outside of

 

the body. Unlike the spoken or written sign, it does not cut itself off from the desiring body of

 

the person who traces or from the immediately perceived image of the other. It is of course

 

still an image which is traced at the tip of the wand, but an image that is not com

pletely

 

separated from the person it represents; what the drawing draws is almost present in person in

 

his 

shadow. 

The distance from the shadow or from the wand is almost nothing. She who

 

traces, holding, handling, now, the wand, is very close to touching what is very close to being

 

the other 

itself, 

close by a minute difference; that small difference—visibility, spacing, death

—is undoubtedly the origin of the sign and the breaking of im

mediacy; but it is in reducing it

 

as much as possible that one marks the contours of signification. One thinks the sign

 

beginning from its limit, which belongs neither to nature nor to convention. Now this limit—

of an impossible sign, of a sign giving the signified, indeed the thing, 

in person, 

immediately

—is necessarily closer to gesture or glance than to speech. A certain ideality of the sound

 

behaves essentially as the power of abstraction and mediation. The movement of the wand is

 

rich with all possible dis-courses but no discourse can reproduce it without impoverishing and

 

deforming it. The written sign is absent from the body but this absence is already announced

 

within the invisible and ethereal element of the spoken word, powerless to imitate the contact

 

and the movement of the bodies. The gesture, that of passion rather than that of need,

 

considered in its purity of origin, guards us against an already alienating speech, a speech

 

already carrying in itself death and absence. That is why, when it does not precede the spoken

 

word, it supplements it, corrects its fault and fills its




((235))

lack. The movement of the wand is a substitute for all discourse that, at a greater distance,

 

would substitute itself for it. This relationship of mutual and incessant supplementarity or

 

substitution 

is 

the order of language. It 

is 

the origin of language, as it 

is 

described without

 

being declared, in the 

Essay on the Origin of Languages, 

which is here also in agreement with

 

the second 

Discourse: 

in both texts, the visible gesture, more natural and more expressive, can

 

join itself as a supplement to speech, which is itself a substitute for gesture. This graphic of

 

supplementarity 

is 

the origin of lan

guages: it separates gesture and speech primitively united

 

in the mythic purity, absolutely immediate and therefore natural, of the cry:

The first language of mankind, the most universal and vivid, in a word the only language man

 

needed, before he had occasion to exert his eloquence to persuade assembled multitudes, was

 

the simple cry of nature. . . . ‘When the ideas of men began to expand and multiply, and closer

 

communication took place among them, they strove to invent more numerous signs and a

 

more copious language. 

They multiplied the inflexions of the voice, and added gestures, which

 

are in their nature more expressive, and depend less for their meaning on a prior de-

termination 

(p. 148; italics added) [p. 176].

Gesture is here an adjunct of speech, but this 

adjunct is 

not a supple

menting by artifice, it is a

 

re-course to a more natural, more expressive, more immediate sign. It is the more universal

 

the less it depends on conven

tions. 50 But if gesture supposes a distance and a spacing, a

 

milieu of 

visi

bility, it ceases being effective when the excess of distance or mediation

 

interrupts visibility: then speech supplements gesture. Everything in lan

guage is substitute,

 

and this concept of substitute precedes the opposition of nature and culture: the supplement

 

can equally well be natural (gesture) as artificial (speech).

But, as hardly anything can be indicated by gestures, except 

objects actually present 

or easily

 

described, and 

visible actions; 

as they are not universally in use—for darkness or the

 

interposition of a material object destroys their 

efficacy—and 

as 

besides they rather request

 

than secure our attention; 

men at length bethought themselves of 

substituting 

for them the

 

articulate sounds of the voice, which, without bearing the same relation to any particular

 

ideas, are better calculated to express them all, as conventional 

[institués] 

signs. 

Such a

 

substitution 

could only be made by common consent, and must have been ef

fected in a

 

manner not very easy for men whose gross organs had not been accustomed to any such

 

exercise. It is also in itself still more difficult to con

ceive, since such a common agreement

 

must have been motivated, and speech seems to have been highly necessary to establish the

 

use of it (pp. 148—49; italics added) [pp. 176-77].

Speech excites attention, the visible exacts it: is it because the ear is always open and offered

 

to provocation, more passive than sight? One can

((236))

more naturally 

close one’s eyes or distract his glance than avoid listening. Let us not forget

 

that this natural situation is primarily that of the child at the breast.




This structure of supplementarity, reflexive, mutual, speculative, infinite, alone permits an

 

explanation of the fact that the language of space, sight, and muteness (Rousseau knew also

 

51 that it signified death) sometimes takes the place of speech when the latter is attended by a

 

greater 

threat of absence and cuts into life’s energy. In that case, the language of visible

 

gestures is more alive. Love “might also have invented speech, though less happily. Not being

 

very well pleased with it, it disdains it; it has livelier ways of expressing itself. How she could

 

say things to her beloved, who traced his shadow with such pleasure! What sounds might she

 

use to work such magic?” 

[Essay, 

p. 

6].

It is therefore after the invention of language and the birth of passion that desire, in order to

 

recapture presence and according to the pattern I have identified, returns to the movement of

 

the magic wand, to the finger and the eye, to a mutism charged with discourse. It is the

 

question of a supplementary return toward a greater naturalness, not of an origin of language.

 

Rousseau clarifies it further on by distinguishing gesture from gesticulation: the former,

 

which sketches the shadow of presence, silently governs the first metaphor; the latter is an

 

indiscreet and cumbersome adjunct of speech. It is a bad supplement. The silent language of

 

love is not a pre:linguistic gesture, it is a “mute eloquence.”

Our [European] gestures merely indicate our natural unrest. It is not of those that I wish to

 

speak. Only Europeans gesticulate when speaking; one might say that all their power of

 

speech is in their arms. Their lungs are powerful too, but to nearly no avail. Where a

 

Frenchman would strain and torture his body, emitting a great verbal torrent, a Turk will

 

momentarily remove his pipe from his mouth to utter a few words softly, crushing one with a

 

single sentence. [Here the Turk is no longer, like his language, from the North, but from the

 

Orient. We are at once from the North and from the Occident.] 

[Essay, 

p. 

6]

The value of the mute sign is also that of sobriety and discretion 

within speech: 

the economy

 

of speech.

Since learning to gesticulate, we have forgotten the art of pantomime, for the same reason that

 

with all our beautiful systems of grammar we no longer under-stand the symbols of the

 

Egyptians. What the ancients said in the liveliest way, they did not express in words but bv

 

means of signs. They did not say it, they showed it. 

[Essay, 

p. 

6]

What they showed was clearly not the thing but its hieroglyphic meta

phor, the visible sign.

 

This praise of Egyptian symbolism may surprise us: it is a praise of writing and a praise of

 

savagery, more precisely of that writing of which we are told further along that it suits

 

savages. Savagery

((237))

does not characterize the primitive state of man, the state of pure nature, but rather the state of

 

society being born, of the first language and the first passions. A state structurally anterior to

 

the state of barbarism, itself an

terior to civil society. In fact, in the chapter “On Script” (5),

 

Egyptian hieroglyphs are defined as the most crude and most antique script. It would suit

 

people assembled as a nation under the form of savagery:




The cruder the writing, the more ancient the langauge. The primitive way of writing was not

 

to represent sounds, but objects themselves whether directly, as with the Mexicans, or by

 

allegorical imagery, or as the Egyptians did in still other ways. This stage corresponds to

 

passionate language, and already supposes some society and some needs to which the

 

passions have given birth. . . . The depicting of objects is appropriate to a savage people.

 

[Essay, pp. 

16—17]

The hieroglyphic language is an impassioned language. Savagery holds itself closest to this

 

passional origin of language. The paradox is that thus it also holds itself closer to writing than

 

to speech. Because gesture, which elsewhere expresses need, here represents passion. It is

 

writing not only because it traces, like the movement of the wand, a design in space, but

 

because the signifier first signifies a signifier, and not the thing itself or a directly presented

 

signified. The hieroglyphic 

graphie is 

already allegorical. The gesture which speaks before

 

words 

[dit la parole avant les mots] 

and which “argues with the eyes,” is the moment of

 

savage writing.

Consider ancient history; it is full of such ways of appealing to the eye, each of them more

 

effective than all the discourse that might have 

replaced it. 

An object held up before speaking

 

will arouse the imagination, excite curiosity, hold the mind in suspense, in expectation of what

 

will be said. I have noticed that Italians and Provencals, among whom gesture ordinarily

 

precedes discourse, use this as a way of drawing attention and of pleasing their listeners. 

But

 

in the most vigorous language, everything is said symbolically, before one actually speaks.

 

Tarquin, or Thrasybulus lopping off poppies; Alexander applying his seal to the mouth of his

 

favorite, Diogenes promenading in front of Zeno: do they not speak more effectively than

 

with words? What verbal circumlocution would express the same idea as well? 52 (Italics

 

added.) 

[Essay, 

pp. 6—7]

How can the language of gesture or sight express passion here, and need elsewhere? The

 

“contradiction” between these different texts responds to the unity of an intention and the

 

necessity of a constraint.

1. Rousseau speaks the desire of immediate presence. ‘When the latter is 

better represented

 

by the range of the voice and reduces dispersion, he praises living speech, which is the

 

language of the passions. When the im

mediacy of presence is 

better represented 

by the

 

proximity and rapidity of the gesture and the glance, he praises the most savage writing,

 

which does not represent oral representation: the hieroglyph.

2. This concept of writing designates the place of unease, of the regu-

((238))

lated incoherence within conceptuality, both beyond the 

Essay 

and be

yond Rousseau. This

 

incoherence would apply to the fact that the unity of need and passion (with the entire system

 

of associated significations) con

stantly effaces the limit that Rousseau obstinately sketches

 




and recalls. Rousseau 

declares 

this backbone, without which the entire conceptual organism

 

would break up, and 

wishes to think it 

as a distinction; he 

describes 

it as a supplementary

 

differance. This constrains in its graphics the strange unity of passion and need.

How does writing reveal it? How is writing, like pity, for example, both in nature and outside

 

of it? Like the awakening of imagination before this, what does the awakening of writing

 

signify here, if it belongs neither to nature nor to its other?

Writing precedes and follows speech, it comprehends it. This is already true from the only

 

point of view that concerns us here: that of the structure of the 

Essay. 

On the one hand, the

 

theory of writing follows the genealogy of speech and is proposed as a sort of supplementary

 

appendix. Once one has described the passional origin of speech, one can accessorily consider

 

that accessory which is writing, in order to draw from it some supple

mentary information

 

about the state of languages. The entire chapter “On Script” is opened and governed by this

 

declared project. After having sum

marized the progress of languages and the movement of

 

supplementarity and substitution which holds it to its law (“one substitutes” new articula

tions

 

for accents that efface themselves, “one substitutes ideas for senti

ments,” etc.), Rousseau

 

introduces a new development: “Another way of comparing languages and determining their

 

relative antiquity is to consider their script, and reason inversely from the degree of perfection

 

of this art” [p.16].

Yet writing had to appear even before there was a question of speech and its passional origin.

 

The movement of the magic wand and the hieroglyph expressed a passion before the passion

 

that draws out “the primitive voices”; and as writing will also be recognized as the language

 

of need, it will have stated need before need. The first allusion to writing holds itself out of

 

reach of all 

distinction, 

if not of all differance of need from passion. The 

advantage 

of writing

 

requires a new conceptuality.

The metaphoric origin of speech opens an eye, one might say, at the center of language. And

 

the passion that draws out the first voices relates to the image. The visibility inscribed on the

 

act of birth of the voice is not purely perceptive, it signifies. Writing is the eve of speech. That

 

appears also from the first chapter.

Darius, engaged with his army in Scythia, receives from the King of Scythia a frog, a bird, a

 

mouse, and five arrows. The herald makes the presentation in

((239))

silence and departs. That terrible harangue was understood; and Darius returned to his own

 

country as quickly as he could. 

Substitute a letter 

[namely, a phonetic script] for this sign: the

 

more menancing it is, the less frightening will it be. It will be no more than a boast, which

 

would draw merely a smile from Darius. 53 

[Essay, 

p. 

7]

And after another series of Biblical and Greek examples,




Thus one speaks more effectively to the eye than to the ear. 

There is no one who does not feel

 

the truth of Horace’s judgment in this regard. Clearly the most eloquent speeches are those

 

containing the most imagery; and sounds are never more 

forceful 

than when they produce the

 

effects of colors. (Italics added.) 

[Essay, 

p. 

8]

Decisive consequence: eloquence depends upon the image. What is al-ready announced is

 

“That the First Language Had to Be Figurative” (title of Chapter 3) . The metaphor within

 

spoken language draws its 

energy 

from the visible and from a sort of oral picto-hieroglyphics.

 

Now if one con-siders that Rousseau elsewhere associates visibility, space, painting, writing,

 

etc., with the loss of passional energy, with need and sometimes with death, one must surely

 

decide within, the 

advantage of writing, 

in favor of the unity of heterogeneous or so-declared

 

values. But Rousseau cannot declare this unity of the advantage of writing. He can only

 

describe it clandestinely as he plays with the different parts of his discourse. Even though he

 

con

tradicts himself, he places writing on the side of need and speech on the side of passion. In

 

the passage that we have just cited, it is clear that it is a question of passional signs. That will

 

be confirmed further along when hieroglyphic script will be defined as “impassioned

 

language.” Yet if “sounds never have more energy than when they make the effect of colors,”

 

it is not that color or that space as such which speaks to passion. Rousseau unexpectedly

 

reverses the order of the demonstration: only the spoken word has the power of expressing or

 

exciting passion.

But when it is a question of stirring the heart and inflaming the passions, it is an altogether

 

different matter. The successive impressions of discourse, which strike a redoubled blow,

 

produce 

a different feeling from that of the continuous presence of the same object, 

which can

 

be taken in at a single glance. Imagine someone in a painful situation that is fully known; as

 

you watch the afflicted person, you are not likely to weep. But give him time to tell you what

 

he feels and soon you will burst into tears. It is solely in this way that the scenes of a tragedy

 

produce their effect.* Pantomime without discourse will leave you nearly tranquil; discourse

 

without gesture will bring tears from you. 

The passions have

I have said elsewhere why 

feigned misfortunes touch us more than real ones. 

There is

 

a type that weeps at a tragedy, yet has never had any pity for the suffering. The inven

lacking.

pp. 8—9] [Rousseau’s footnote.]

((240))

their gestures, but they also have their accents; 

and these accents, which thrill 

us, these tones

 

of voice that cannot fail to be heard, penetrate to the very depths of the heart, carrying there

 

the emotions they wring from us, forcing us in spite of ourselves 

to feel what we hear. 

We

 

conclude that while visible signs can render a more exact imitation, sounds more effectively

 

arouse interest.




In this argument I have emphasized the two controlling strands.

Right at first the sound touches us, interests us, impassions us all the more because 

it

 

penetrates 

us. It is the element of interiority because its essence, its own energy, implies that

 

its reception is obligatory. As we noted above, I can close my eyes, I can avoid being touched

 

by that which I see and that which is perceptible at a distance. But my passivity and my

 

passion are totally open to “accents to which one may not conceal one’s organ,” which

 

“penetrate through it to the bottom of one’s heart, and carry there in spite of us the movements

 

which draw them forth.” Voice penetrates into me violently, it is the privileged route for

 

forced entry and interioriza

tion, whose reciprocity produces itself in the “hearing-oneself-

speak,” in the structure of the voice and of interlocution. 54

This violence obliges Rousseau to temper the praise of passion and to suspect this complicity

 

between voice and heart. But another violence complicates this scheme even more. Within the

 

voice, the presence of the object already disappears. The self-presence of the voice and of the

 

heading-oneself speak conceals the very thing that visible space allows to be placed before us.

 

The thing disappearing, the voice substitutes an acoustic sign for it which can, in the place of

 

the object taken away, penetrate profoundly into me, to lodge there “in the depth of the heart.”

 

It is the only way of interiorizing the phenomenon; by transforming it into 

akoumène; 

which

 

supposes an originary synergy and an originary synesthesia; but which also supposes that the

 

disappearance of presence in the form of the object, the being-before-the-eyes or being-at-

hand, installs a sort of fiction, if not a lie, at the very origin of speech. Speech never gives the

 

thing itself, but a simulacrum that touches us more profoundly than the truth, “strikes” us

 

more effectively. Another ambiguity in the appreciation of speech. It is not the presence of the

 

object which moves us but its phonic sign: “The suc

cessive impressions of discourse, which

 

strike a redoubled blow, produce a different feeling from that of the continuous presence of

 

the same object. ... I have said elsewhere why feigned misfortunes touch us more than real

 

ones.” If the theater is condemned, it is thus not because it is, as its name implies, a place of

 

spectacle; it is because it makes us hear and understand.

Thus is explained the nostalgia for a society of need that Rousseau dis-qualifies so harshly

 

elsewhere. Dream of a mute society, of a society before the origin of languages, that is to say,

 

strictly speaking, a society before society.

((241))

This leads me to think that if the only needs we ever experienced were physical, we should

 

most likely never have been able to speak; we would fully expiess our meanings by the

 

language of gesture alone. We would have been able to estab

lish societies little different from

 

those we have, or such as would have been better able to achieve their goals. We would have

 

been able to institute laws, to choose leaders, to invent arts, to establish commerce, and to do,

 

in a word, almost as many things as we do with the help of speech. Without fear of jealousy,

 

the secrets of oriental gallantry are passed across the more strictly guarded harems in the

 

epistolary language of salaams. The mutes of great nobles understand each other, and

 

understand everything that is said to them by means of signs, just as well as one can

 

understand anything said in discourse. 

[Essay, 

P. 9]




With reference to this society of mute writing, the advent of speech resembles a catastrophe,

 

an unpredictable misfortune. Nothing made it necessary. At the end of the 

Essay, 

this pattern

 

is exactly inverted.

Things are further complicated if one considers that the language of needs is a natural

 

language and that it would be difficult to find a sure cri

terion for distinguishing between this

 

mute society and animal society. One does then perceive that the only difference between

 

what Rousseau wished to consider the fixity of animal language and the progressiveness of

 

human languages is not dependent on any one organ, any one sense, is not to be found in

 

either the visible or the audible order. It is once again the 

power of substituting one organ for

 

another, of articulating space and time, 

sight and voice, hand and spirit, it is this 

faculty of

 

supplementarity 

which is the true “origin”—or nonorigin—of languages: articulation in

 

general, as articulation of nature and of convention, of nature and all its others. This is what

 

one must emphasize right from the close of Chapter I:

It appears again, by the same observations, that the invention of the art of com

municating our

 

ideas depends less upon the organs we use in such communica

tion than it does upon a power

 

proper to man, according to which he uses his organs in this way, and which, 

if he lacked

 

these, would lead him to use others to the same end. 

Give man a structure [organically] as

 

crude as you please: doubtless he will acquire fewer ideas, but if only he has some means of

 

contact with his fellow men, by means of which one can act and another can sense, he will

 

finally succeed in communicating whatever ideas he might have. Animals have a more than

 

sufficient structure for such communication, but none of them has ever made use of it. This

 

seems to me a quite characteristic difference. That those animals which 

live and work in

 

common, such as beavers, ants, bees, have some natural language for communicating among

 

themselves, I would not question. 

There is even reason to think that the speech of beavers and

 

ants is 

by gesture; i.e., it is only visual. 

If so, such languages are natural, not acquired. The

 

animals that speak them possess them a-horning: they all have them, and they are everywhere

 

the same. They are entirely unchanging and make not the

((242))

slightest progress. Conventional language is characteristic of man alone. (Italics added.)

 

[Essay, p. 10]

Animal language—and animality in general—represents here the still liv-ing myth of fixity, of

 

symbolic incapacity, of nonsupplementarity. If we consider the 

concept 

of animality not in its

 

content of understanding or misunderstanding but in its specific 

function, 

we shall see that it

 

must locate a moment of 

life 

which knows nothing of symbol, substitution, lack and

 

supplementary addition, etc.—everything, in fact, whose appearance and play I wish to

 

describe here. A life that has not yet broached the play of supplementarity and which at the

 

same time has not yet let itself be violated by it: a life without differance and without

 

articulation.

The Inscription of the Origin. 

This detour was necessary for recapturing the function of the

 

concept of 

articulation. 

It broaches language: it opens speech as institution born of passion

 




but it threatens song as original speech. It pulls language toward need and reason—

accomplices—and there-fore lends itself to writing more easily. The more articulated a

 

language is, the less accentuated it is, the more rational it is, the less musical it is, and the less

 

it loses by being written, the better it expresses need. It becomes Nordic.

Rousseau wants us to think of this movement as an accident. He de-scribes it however in its

 

originary necessity. This unhappy accident is also a “natural progress.” It does not come

 

unexpectedly upon a constituted song, nor does it surprise a full music. Before articulation,

 

therefore, we now know, there is no speech, no song, and thus no music. Passion could not be

 

expressed or imitated without articulation. The “cry of nature” (second 

Discourse), 

the

 

“simple sounds [that] emerge naturally from the throat” 

(Essay 

4), do not make a language

 

because articulation has not yet played there. “Natural sounds are inarticulate” 

(Essay 4).

 

Convention has its hold only upon articulation, which pulls language out of the cry, and

 

increases itself with consonants, tenses, and quantity. 

Thus language is born out of the

 

process of its own degeneration. 

That is why, in order to convey Rousseau’s 

descriptive

 

procedure, which does not wish to restore the facts but merely to measure a deviation, it is

 

perhaps imprudent to call by the name of zero degree or simple origin that out of which the

 

deviation is measured or the structure outlined. Zero degree or origin im-plies that the

 

commencement be simple, that it not be at the same time the beginning of a degeneration, that

 

it be possible to think it in the form of presence in general, whether it be a modified presence

 

or not, whether it be past event or permanent essence. To speak of simple origin, it must also

 

be possible to measure deviation according to a simple axis and in a single

((243))

direction. Is it still necessary to recall that nothing in Rousseau’s description authorizes us to

 

do so?

To speak of origin and zero degree in fact comments on Rousseau’s de

clared intention and it

 

corrects on that point more than one classical or hasty reading. But in spite of that declared

 

intention, Rousseau’s discourse lets itself be constrained by a complexity which always has

 

the form of the supplement of or from the origin. His declared intention is not annulled by this

 

but rather 

inscribed 

within a system which it no longer dominates. The desire for the origin

 

becomes an indispensable and indestructible function situated within a syntax without origin.

 

Rousseau would like to separate originarity from supplementarity. All the rights constituted by

 

our logos are on his side: it is unthinkable and intolerable that what has the name 

origin

 

should be no more than a point situated within the system of supple

mentarity. The latter in

 

fact wrenches language from its condition of origin, from its conditional or its future of

 

origin, from that which it must (ought to) have been and what it has never been; it could only

 

have been born by suspending its relation to all origin. Its history is that of the supplement of

 

(from) origin: of the originary substitute and the substitute of the origin. Let us observe the

 

play of the tenses and modes at the end of Chapter 4 which describes the ideal of the language

 

of origin:

Since natural sounds are inarticulate, words 

would have 

few articulations. Inter-posing some

 

consonants to fill the gaps between vowels 

would suffice 

to make them fluid and easy to

 




pronounce. On the other hand, the sounds would be very varied, and the diversity of accents

 

for each sound 

would further multiply 

them. Quantity and rhythm 

would account for 

still

 

further combinations. Since sounds, accents, and number, which are natural, would leave little

 

to articulation, which is conventional, it 

would be sung 

rather than spoken. Most of the root

 

words would be imitative sounds or accents of passion, or effects of sense objects. It 

would

 

contain 

many onomatopoeic expressions. This language 

would have 

many synonyms for

 

expressing the same thing according to various relationships.* It 

would have 

few adverbs and

 

abstract names for expressing these same relationships. It 

would have 

many augmentatives,

 

diminutives, composite words, expletive particles to indicate the cadence of sentences and

 

fullness of phrases. It 

would have 

many irregularities and anomalies. It 

would deemphasize

 

gram

matical analogy for euphony, number, harmony, and beauty of sounds. Instead of

 

arguments, it 

would have 

aphorisms. It 

would persuade 

without convincing, and 

would

 

represent 

without reasoning. [Follows the customary extrinsic or archaeological reference.] It

 

would resemble 

Chinese in certain respects, Greek and Arabic in others. If you understand

 

these ideas in all their ramifications, you will find that Plato’s 

Cratylus 

is not as ridiculous as

 

it appears to be (italics added) [pp. 15-16].

((244))

The stage thus described in the conditional is 

already 

that of a language that has broken with

 

gesture, need, animality, etc. But of a language that 

has not yet 

been corrupted by articulation,

 

convention, supplementarity. The time of that language is the unstable, inaccessible, mythic

 

limit be

tween that 

already 

and this 

not-yet: 

time of a language 

being born, 

just as there was a

 

time for “society being born.” Neither before nor after the origin.

After having observed this play of the temporal mode, let us continue with our reading. The

 

chapter “On Script” follows immediately. The title alone separates the quotation above from

 

the one following. I stress the sense of certain verbs and the mode of all the verbs:

Anyone who studies the history and progress of the tongues will see that the more the words

 

become monotonous, the more the consonants multiply; that, as accents fall into disuse and

 

quantities are neutralized, they are 

replaced [supplée] 

by grammatical combinations and new

 

articulations. But only the pres-sure of time brings these changes about. To the degree that

 

needs multiply, that affairs become complicated, that light is shed [knowledge is increased],

 

language changes its character. It becomes more regular and less passionate. It 

substitutes

 

ideas for feelings. It no longer speaks to the heart but to reason. For that very reason, accent

 

diminishes, articulation increases. Language becomes more exact and clearer, but more prolix,

 

duller and colder. This progression seems to me entirely natural [p. 16].

Thus supplementarity makes possible all that constitutes the property of man: speech, society,

 

passion, etc. But what is this property 

[propre] 

of man? On the one hand, it is that of which

 




the possibility must be thought before man, and outside of him. Man allows himself to be

 

announced to himself after the fact of supplementarity, which is thus not an attribute—

accidental or essential—of man. For on the other hand, supplementarity, which is 

nothing,

 

neither a presence nor an absence, is neither a substance nor an essence of man. It is precisely

 

the play of presence and absence, the opening of this play that no metaphysical or ontological

 

concept can com

prehend. Therefore this property 

[propre] 

of man is not a property of man: it

 

is the very dislocation of the proper in general: it is the dislocation of the characteristic, the

 

proper in general, the impossibility—and therefore the desire—of self-proximity; the

 

impossibility and therefore the desire of pure presence. That supplementarity is not a

 

characteristic or property of man does not mean only, and in an equally radical manner, that it

 

is not a characteristic or property; but also that its play precedes what one calls man and

 

extends outside of him. Man 

calls himself 

man only by drawing limits excluding his other

 

from the play of supplementarity: the purity of nature, of animality, primitivism, childhood,

 

madness, divinity. The ap

proach to these limits is at once feared as a threat of death, and

 

desired as access to a life without differance. The history of man 

calling himself 

man

((245))

is the articulation of 

all 

these limits among themselves. All concepts de

termining a non-

supplementarity (nature, animality, primitivism, child-hood, madness, divinity, etc.) have

 

evidently no truth-value. They belong—moreover, with the idea of truth itself—to an epoch of

 

supplementarity. They have meaning only within a closure of the game.

Writing will appear to us more and more as another name for this structure of

 

supplementarity. If one takes into account that, according to Rousseau himself, articulation

 

makes possible both speech and writing (a language is necessarily articulated and the more

 

articulated it is, the more it lends itself to writing) one should be assured of what Saussure

 

hesitated to say in what we know of the 

Anagrams, 

namely, that there are no phonemes before

 

the grapheme. That is, before that which operates as a principle of death within speech.

Perhaps now one will better grasp the situation of Rousseau’s discourse with reference to this

 

concept of the supplement, and by the same token, the status of the analysis that I am

 

attempting here. It does not suffice to say that Rousseau thinks the supplement without

 

thinking it, that he does not match his saying and his meaning, his descriptions and his

 

declarations. One must still organize this separation and this contradiction. Rousseau uses the

 

word and describes the thing. But now we know that what con

cerns us here belongs neither to

 

word nor to thing. Word and thing are referential limits that only the supplementary structure

 

can produce and mark.

Using the word and describing the thing, Rousseau in a way displaces and deforms the sign

 

“supplement,” the unity of the signifier and the signified, as it is articulated among nouns

 

(supplement, substitute 

[supplé

ment, suppléant]), 

verbs (to supply, to be substituted

 

[suppléer, se sub

stituer], 

etc.) and adjectives (supplementary, suppletory 

[supplémentaire,

 

supplétif]) 

and makes the signifieds play on the register of plus or minus. But these

 

displacements and deformations are regulated by the contra

dictory unity—itself

 

supplementary—of a desire. As in the dream, as Freud analyzes it, incompatibles are

 




simultaneously admitted as soon as it is a matter of satisfying a desire, in spite of the principle

 

of identity, or of the excluded third party—the logical time of consciousness. Using a word

 

other than dream, inaugurating a conceptuality which would no longer belong to the

 

metaphysics of presence or consciousness (opposing wakefulness and dream even within

 

Freud’s discourse), it would be necessary to define a space in which this regulated

 

“contradiction” has been possible and can be described. What is called “history of ideas”

 

would have to begin by dis-engaging this space before articulating its field in terms of other

 

fields. These are, of course, questions that can only be asked.

What are the two contradictory possibilities that Rousseau wishes to retain simultaneously?

 

And how does he do it? He wishes on the one hand

((246))

to 

affirm, 

by giving it a positive value, everything of which articulation is the principle or

 

everything with which it constructs a system (passion, language, society, man, etc.). But he

 

intends to affirm simultaneously all that is cancelled by articulation (accent, life, energy,

 

passion yet again, and so on). The supplement being the articulated structure of these two

 

possi

bilities, Rousseau can only decompose them and dissociate them into two simple units,

 

logically contradictory yet allowing an intact purity to both the negative and the positive. And

 

yet Rousseau, caught, like the logic of identity, 

within 

the graphic of supplementarity, says

 

what he does not wish to say, describes what he does not wish to conclude: that the positive

 

(is) the negative, life (is) death, presence (is) absence and that this repetitive supplementarity

 

is not comprised in any dialectic, at least if that concept is governed, as it always has been, by

 

a horizon of presence. More-over, Rousseau is not alone in being caught in the graphic of

 

supple

mentarity. All meaning and therefore all discourse is caught there, par

ticularly and by a

 

singular turn, the discourse of the metaphysics within which Rousseau’s concepts move. And

 

when Hegel will proclaim the unity of absence and presence, of nonbeing and being,

 

dialectics or history will continue to be, at least on the level of discourse that we have called

 

Rous

seau’s wishing-to-say, a movement of mediation between two full presences.

 

Eschatological parousia is also the presence of the full speech, bringing together all its

 

differences and its articulations within the consciousness (of) self of the logos. Consequently,

 

before asking the necessary questions about the historical situation of Rousseau’s text, we

 

must locate all the signs of its appurtenance to the metaphysics of presence, from Plato to

 

Hegel, rhythmed by the articulation of presence upon self-presence. The unity of this

 

metaphysical tradition should be respected in its general permanence through all the marks of

 

appurtenance, the genealogical sequences, the stricter routes of causality that organize

 

Rousseau’s text. ‘We must recog

nize, prudently and as a preliminary, what this historicity

 

amounts to; without this, what one would inscribe within a narrower structure would not be a

 

text and above all not Rousseau’s text. It does not suffice to under-stand Rousseau’s text

 

within that implication of the epochs of metaphysics or of the West—what I only diffidently

 

sketch here. We must also know that this history of metaphysics, to which the concept of

 

history itself returns, belongs to an ensemble for which the name history is no longer suitable.

 

All this interplay of implications is so complex that it would be more than imprudent to wish

 

to assure oneself as to how much of it is proper to a text 

[revient en propre a un texte], 

for

 

example, Rousseau’s. That is not only difficult, it is in fact impossible; the question which one

 




professes to answer here has undoubtedly no meaning outside of the meta-physics of

 

presence, of the proper 

[propre] 

and of the subject. There is not, strictly speaking, a text

 

whose author or subject is Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

((247))

From this principal proposition, it remains to draw the rigorous conse

quences, without

 

confusing all the subordinate propositions under the pre-text that their meaning and their

 

limits are already contested at their root.

The Neume. 

We shall, then, examine how Rousseau operates when, for example, he attempts

 

to define the limit of possibility of the thing whose impossibility he describes: the natural

 

voice or the inarticulate language. No longer the animal cry before the birth of language; but

 

not yet the articulated language, already shaped and undermined by absence and death.

 

Between the prelinguistic and the linguistic, between cry and speech, ani

mal and man, nature

 

and society, Rousseau looks for a limit “being bom,” and he gives it several determinations.

 

There are at least two of them that have the same function. They relate to childhood and to

 

God. In each, two contradictory predicates are united: it is a matter of language uncon

-

taminated by supplementarity.

The model of this impossible “natural voice” is first that of childhood. Described in the

 

conditional in the Essay—let us recall the analysis of the “natural voices” that “are not

 

articulated”—consider it now in 

Emile. 

The 

alibi 

and the 

in illo tempore 

are no longer

 

Chinese or Greek, but the child:

All our languages are the result of art. 

It has long been a subject of inquiry whether there ever

 

was a 

natural language 

common to all; no doubt there is, 

and it is the language of children

 

before they begin [have learned] to speak. This language is inarticulate, but it has tone,

 

stress, and meaning. The use of our own language has led us to neglect it so far as to forget it

 

altogether. 

Let us study children and we shall soon learn it afresh from them. Nurses can teach

 

us this language; they understand all their nurslings say to them, they answer them, and keep

 

up long conversations with them; and though they use words, these words are quite useless. 

It

 

is not the sense of the word, but its accompany-ing intonation [accent] that is understood (p.

 

45; italics added) [p. 32].

To 

speak before knowing how to speak, 

such is the limit toward which Rousseau obstinately

 

guides his repetition of origin. This limit is indeed that of nonsupplementarity but as there

 

must already be language there, the supplement must announce itself without having been

 

produced, lack and absence must have begun without beginning. Without the summons of the

 

supplement, the child would not speak at all: if he did not suffer, if he lacked nothing, he

 

would not call, he would not speak. But if sup

plementarity had simply been produced, if it

 

had really begun, the child would speak knowing how to speak. 

The child speaks before

 

knowing how to speak. 

He has language, but what is lacking in it is the power of 

replacing

 

itself, 

of substituting one sign for another, one organ of expression for another; what he lacks

 

is, as the Essay said, let us recall, “a power proper to man, according to which he uses his

 




organs in this way, and which, if he lacked these, would lead him to use others to the same

 

end” [p. 10]. The

((248))

child—the concept of the child—is the concept of one who has no more than one language

 

because he has only one organ. And that signifies that his lack, his unease itself, is unique and

 

uniform, not countenancing any substitution or any operation of supplementing. Such is

 

Rousseau’s child. He has no language because he has only one:

He has only one language because he has, so to say, only one kind of discom

fort. In the

 

imperfect state of his sense organs he does not distingiush their several impressions; all ills

 

produce one feeling of sorrow. (p. 46) 

[Emile, 

p. 

32]

The child will know how to speak when one form of his unease can be substituted for another;

 

then he will be able to slip from one language to another, slide one sign under another, play

 

with the signifying substance; he will enter into the order of the supplement, here determined

 

as the human order: he will no longer weep, he will know how to say “I hurt.”

When children begin to talk they cry less. This progress is quite natural; one language

 

supplants another. . . . When once Emile has said, “It hurts me,” it will take a very sharp pain

 

to make him cry. (p. 59) 

[Emile, 

p. 41]

To speak before knowing how: childhood is good because speech is good, the property

 

[propre] 

of man. The child speaks. Childhood is good because the knowledge of speech

 

comes only with the evil of articulation. The child does not know how to speak. But

 

childhood is not good since already it speaks; and it is not good because it does not have the

 

property and the good of man: knowledge of speech. Whence the regulated instability of the

 

judgments on childhood: for better and for worse, it is sometimes on the side of animality,

 

sometimes on the side of humanity. That the child speaks without knowing how to speak, that

 

may be to his credit; but he also speaks without knowing how to sing: which is why he is no

 

longer an animal that neither speaks nor sings, and not yet a man who both speaks and sings:

Man has three kinds of voice, the speaking or articulate voice, the singing or melodious voice,

 

and the pathetic or accented voice, which serves as the language of the passions, and gives life

 

to song and speech. The child has these three voices, just as the man has them, but he does not

 

know how to use them in combination. Like us, he laughs, cries, laments, shrieks, and groans,

 

but he does not know how to combine these inflections with speech or song. These three

 

voices find their best expression in perfect music. Children are incapable of such music, and

 

their singing lacks feeling. In the same way their spoken language lacks expression; they

 

shout, but they do not speak with emphasis, and there is as little power in their voice as there

 

is emphasis in their speech. 

(Emile,

pp. I61–62) [p. 113]

Articulation, wherever one finds it, is indeed articulation: that of the members and the organs,

 

differance (in the) (self-same) 

[propre] 

body. Is




((249))

not breath seemingly the most appropriate thing for effacing this dif

ferance in natural

 

expression? A speaking and singing breath, breath of language which is nonetheless

 

inarticulate.

Such a breath cannot have a human origin and a human destination. It is no longer on the way

 

to humanity like the language of the child, but is rather on the way to superhumanity. Its

 

principle and its end are theo

logical, as the voice and providence of nature. It is on this onto-

theological model that Rousseau regulates his repetitions of origin. With this ex

emplary

 

model of a pure breath 

(pneuma) 

and of an intact life, of a song and an inarticulate language,

 

of speech without spacing, we have, even if it is placeless 

[atopique] 

or utopian, a paradigm

 

suitable to our measure. We can name and define it. It is the 

neume: 

pure vocalization, form of

 

an inarticulate song without speech, whose name means breath, which is in-spired in us by

 

God and may address only Him. The 

Dictionary of Music 

defines it as such:

NEUME. s.f. A term in church-music. The neume is a kind of short recapitula

tion of the air in

 

a mode, which is made at the end of an antiphon, by a simple variety of sounds, and without

 

joining to them any words. The Catholics authorize this singular custom on a passage of St.

 

Augustine, who says, that no words being possible to be worthy of pleasing God, it is

 

laudable to address him in a confused music of jubilation. “For to whom is such a jubilation

 

suitable, unless to an ineffable Being? and how can we celebrate this ineffable Being, 

since

 

we cannot be silent, or find any thing in our transports which can express them, unless

 

unarticulated sounds?” 

(Italics added.) [pp. 270–71]

To speak before knowing how to speak, not to be able either to be silent or to speak, this limit

 

of origin is indeed that of a pure presence, present enough to be living, to be felt in pleasure

 

[jouissance] 

but pure enough to have remained unblemished by the work of difference,

 

inartic

ulate enough for self-delight 

[jouissance de soi] 

not to be corrupted by interval,

 

discontinuity, alterity. Indeed, Rousseau thinks that this experi

ence of a continual present is

 

accorded 

only to God: given to God or to those whose hearts accord and agree with God’s. It

 

is indeed this accord, this resemblance of the divine and the human that inspires him when he

 

dreams, in the 

Reveries, 

of that experience of a time reduced to presence, 

“where the present

 

lasts forever, without marking its duration in any way, and without any trace of succession”

 

[p. 1131.

Let us reread all these pages: they speak the sorrow of time tom in its presence by memory

 

and anticipation. The pleasure 

[jouissance] 

of a con

tinuous and inarticulate presence is a

 

nearly 

impossible experience: “scarcely is there, in our most living delights, a moment where

 

the heart can truly say to us: 

I wish that this moment should last forever” 

[pp. 112-13]. The

 

heart is not on organ because it is not inscribed with a system of differences




((250))

and articulations. It is not an organ because it is the organ of pure presence. Rousseau

 

experienced this nearly impossible state on the Island of St. Pierre. Much has been written 

55

 

of that description on the themes of nature, water, flowing, etc. Comparing it to pure

 

vocalization, to the pure vowels of the natural language and of the neume, I shall extract from

 

it only the system of four significations.

The pleasure 

[jouissance] 

of self-presence, pure auto-affection, uncor

rupted by any outside,

 

is accorded 

to God:

What is the nature of pleasure in such a situation? Nothing external to one-self, nothing

 

except oneself and one’s own 

[propre] 

existence; so long as this state lasts, one suffices to

 

oneself, like God [pp. 113-14].

There must be 

movement, 

life, 

[jouissance] 

delight in time, self-presence there. But that

 

movement should be 

without intervals, 

without difference, without discontinuity:

There should be neither an absolute repose nor too much agitation, but a uni-form and

 

moderate movement which should have neither shocks nor intervals. Without movement, life

 

is only a lethargy. If the movement is unequal or too strong, it awakens.... The movement

 

which does not come from without, then, is made within us.

This movement is an 

inarticulate speech, 

a speech before words, alive enough to speak, pure,

 

interior and homogeneous enough to relate to no object, to gather into itself no mortal

 

difference, no negativity; it is a charm and therefore a song:

If the movement is unequal or too strong, it awakens; in recalling us to en

vironing objects, it

 

destroys the charm of the reverie and draws us out of our-selves to put us in an instant under

 

the yoke of fortune and man and to bring us back to the feeling of our unhappiness. An

 

absolute silence leads to sadness; it offers us an image of death [p. 115].

Yet, if our hearts are pure enough for it, we live this almost impossible experience, that is

 

almost alien to the constraints of supplementarity, already as a supplement, as a 

compensation

 

[dédommagement]. 

And it is the difference between our experience and that of God Himself:

But an unfortunate who has been withdrawn from human society, and who can do nothing

 

here below that is useful or good for himself or for others, can find in that state consolations

 

[dédommagements] 

for all human enjoyments which fortune and man cannot remove from

 

him. It is true that these consolations can-not be felt by all souls, nor in all situations. It is

 

necessary that the heart should be at peace and that no passion should come to trouble the

 

calm [p. 114].

The difference between God and ourselves is that God distributes, and we receive,

 

compensations. Rousseau’s entire moral theology implies, and




((251))

the 

Vicar 

often uses this word, that divine solicitude can always procure just 

compensations.

 

God alone may dispense with the supplement that He dispenses. He is the dispensation of

 

(exemption from) the supplement.

The neume, the spell of self-presence, inarticulate experience of time, tantamount to saying:

 

utopia. 

Such a language—since a language must be involved—does not, properly speaking,

 

take place. It does not know articu

lation, which cannot take place without spacing and without

 

organization of spaces. There is no language before differences of locale.

The four chapters on “General and Local Difference in the Origin of Languages” (8),

 

“Formation of the Southern Languages” (9), “Formation of the Languages of the North” (10)

 

and “Reflections on these Dif

ferences” (11) give the lie by their description to what seems

 

required by the declared organization of the 

Essay. 

What they describe is that before

 

articulation, that is to say before local difference, there is nothing that one may call language.

 

For we shall see that local differences be

tween the two poles of language always amount to an

 

articulatory play. One cannot therefore describe the structure or the general essence of the

 

language without taking topography into account. Yet that is what Rousseau wanted to do by

 

dealing with language in general before begin

ning the chapter on the general and local

 

difference in the origin of lan

guages. In doing so, he had believed it possible to dissociate

 

structure from origin, or structural origin from local origin : “All that I have said so far applies

 

to primitive tongues in general, and to such development as is due merely to the passage of

 

time. But it does not explain either their origin or their differences” 

[Essay, 

p. 30]. Thus opens

 

the eighth chapter.

If it is true that hereafter articulation measures local difference and that nothing precedes it

 

within language, can one conclude from it that in the classification of languages, in their local

 

or geographic distribution, in the structure of their development, there is no more than a play

 

of correspond

ences, situations, relations? Can one conclude from it that there is no absolute,

 

immobile, and natural center? There again, we must distinguish between description and

 

declaration.

Rousseau 

declares 

the center: there is one single origin, one single zero point in the history of

 

languages. It is the South, the warmth of life, the energy of passion. In spite of the apparent

 

symmetry of the two chapters, in spite of that 

description 

of a double origin of which we have

 

spoken above, Rousseau 

does not wish 

to speak of the two poles of formation: only of a

 

formation and a deformation. Language truly forms itself only in the South. The originary

 

center of language is well reflected in the center of the 

Essay, 

in that Chapter 9, which is by

 

far the longest and richest of all.

In spite of appearances, and contrary to what one might think, Rous-seau does not here simply

 

stop putting aside all the facts. No doubt the factual content is richer than in the second

 

Discourse. 

But it functions as a

((252))




structural index, with the “consciousness of example” which regulates the phenomenological

 

intuition of essence. The first lines, the first note, al-ready authorize this interpretation:

In primitive times* the sparse human population had no more social structure than the family,

 

no laws but those of nature, no language, but that of gesture and some inarticulate sounds.

•

I consider primitive the period of time from the dispersion of men to any period of the

 

human race that might be taken as determining an epoch. [Essay, 

p. 31]

The expression “primitive times,” and all the evidence which will be used to describe them,

 

refer to no date, no event, no chronology. One can vary the facts without modifying the

 

structural invariant. It is a time be-fore time. In every possible historical structure, there

 

seemingly would be a prehistoric, presocial, and also prelinguistic stratum, that one ought

 

always to be able to lay bare. Dispersion, absolute solitude, mutism, experience irrevocably

 

destined to a prereflexive sensation, immediate, without mem

ory, without anticipation,

 

without imagination, without the power of reason or comparison, such would be the virgin

 

soil of any social, historic, or linguistic adventure. Recourse to factual illustration, even to

 

events distant from the origin, is purely fictive. Rousseau is sure of that. And when we make

 

objections to him on historical grounds, or when he seems to make similar objections to

 

himself, in the name of verisimilitude or the compossibility of facts, he wheels around,

 

reminds us that he could not care less about facts when he describes the origin and that he has

 

given a definition of “primitive times.”

I am told that Cain was a farmer and Noah planted grapes. Why not? They were solitaries.

 

What did they have to fear? Besides, this does not conflict with my thesis. I have said what I

 

understand by primitive times. [Essay, p. 34]

We have here another way into the problem of the relationships be

tween the 

Essay 

and the

 

second 

Discourse 

from the point of view of the state of pure nature. There is nothing before

 

the “primitive times” and therefore no rigorously determinable discrepancy between the two

 

texts. We suggested it above in connection with the age of huts. Now we must be more

 

precise.

At first reading, the discrepancy seems incontestable. The “savage” of the 

Discourse 

wanders

 

in the forests “without industry, without speech, and without home” [p. 188]. The barbarian of

 

the 

Essay 

has a family, a cabin and a language, even if he is reduced to “gesture and some

 

inarticulate sounds” [p. 31].

But these discordancies do not seem pertinent from the point of view that interests us.

 

Rousseau is not describing two different and successive states. The family, in the 

Essay, is 

not

 

a society. It does not limit the primi-

((253))

tive dispersion. “In primitive times the 

sparse 

human population had no more social structure

 

than the family.” Which signifies that this family was not a society. It was, as J. Mosconi has

 

called it (cf. supra), a preinstitu

tional phenomenon, purely natural and biological. It was the

 

indispensable condition of that process of generations that the 

Discourse 

also recognized (“the

 

generations multiplied uselessly”). This natural milieu, entailing no institution, had no 

true

 




language. 

And after having attributed “gesture and some inarticulate sounds” to them as

 

language, Rousseau is more pre

cise in a note:

Genuine languages are not at all of domestic origin. They can be established only under a

 

more general, more durable covenant. The American savages hardly speak at all except

 

outside their homes. Each keeps silent in his hut, speaking to his family by signs. And these

 

signs are used infrequently, for a savage is less disquieted, less impatient than a European; he

 

has fewer needs and he is careful to meet them himself.

But to efface the contradiction or rigorous discrepancy between the two texts, one does not

 

have to reduce them to repetitions or overlappings of each other. From one to the other, an

 

emphasis is displaced, a continu

ous sliding is in operation. Or rather, without imputing any

 

order of suc-cession there, we may say that from the 

Discourse 

to the 

Essay 

the sliding

 

movement is toward continuity. The 

Discourse 

wants to 

mark the begin

ning: 

it therefore

 

sharpens and radicalizes the characteristics of virginity within the state of pure nature. The

 

Essay 

would make us 

sense the be

ginnings, 

the movement by which “men sparsely placed on

 

the face of the earth,” continuously wrench themselves away, within a society 

being born,

 

from the state of pure nature. It captures man as he 

passes 

into birth, in that subtle transition

 

from origin to genesis. These two projects do not contradict each other, one does not even

 

have priority over the other, and, as I have noted above, the description of pure nature in the

 

Discourse 

made room within itself for such a transition.

As always, it is the ungraspable limit of the 

almost. 

Neither nature nor society, but 

almost

 

society. Society in the process of birth. The moment when man, no longer belonging, or

 

almost not belonging, to the state of pure nature (which, the 

Discourse 

clearly says, “no

 

longer exists, perhaps never did exist, and probably will never exist; and of which it is,

 

neverthe

less, necessary to have true ideas, in order to form a proper judgment of our present

 

state,” “Preface”) [p. 155], holds himself still short of society, or almost so. It is the only

 

means of restoring the becoming-culture of nature. The family, which Hegel too will call

 

prehistoric, the hut, the language of gestures and inarticulate sounds, are the indications of

 

that 

almost. 

The “savage” life of hunters, the “barbaric” and pre-agricultural life of shep

herds,

 

correspond to this state of almost-society. As in the 

Discourse, so 

in

((254))

the Essay society depends upon agriculture and agriculture upon metallurgy.56

Rousseau encounters here the problem of references to Holy Writ. One can in fact object that

 

“there was already a great deal of agriculture in the time of the patriarchs.” The response

 

further clarifies the status of factual history. The facts reported by the Scriptures do not

 

concern the state of pure nature. But instead of bluntly distinguishing between structural

 

origin and empirical origin, a conciliatory Rousseau hides behind a Biblical au

thority which

 

furnishes him with a structural pattern, by admitting that the patriarchal age is much removed

 

from the origins:




All this is true. But the ages should not be confused. The patriarchal period that we know is

 

very remote from primitive times. Scripture lists ten intervening generations at a time when

 

men were very long-lived. What did they do during these ten generations? We know nothing

 

about it. 

Living almost without society, widely scattered, hardly speaking at all, how could

 

they write? 

And given the uni

formity of their isolated life, what events would they have

 

transmitted to us? (Italics added.) 

[Essay, 

pp. 35–36]

Rousseau adds another resource to this Biblical one: the decadence or the re-decline into

 

barbarism after passing through agriculture. Thanks to a catastrophic event annulling progress

 

and compelling repetition, structural analysis can recommence from zero. This confirms that

 

the structural ac-count does not follow a linear genesis but indicates permanent possibilities

 

which may at any moment reappear in the course of a cycle. The nearly-social state of

 

barbarism may 

in fact 

exist before or after, indeed during and under the state of society.

Adam spoke, Noah spoke; but it is known that Adam was taught by God him-self. In

 

scattering, the children of Noah abandoned agriculture, and the com

mon tongue perished with

 

the first society. That had happened before there was any Tower of Babel. 

[Essay, 

p. 36]

Because there may always be a resurgence of dispersion, because its threat belongs to the

 

essence of society, the analysis of the state of pure nature and the recourse to natural

 

explanations is always possible. On that point Rousseau’s procedure is reminiscent of

 

Condillac’s: who, while ad

mitting that language was given by God as a finished product to

 

Adam and Eve, supposes “that some time after the deluge two children, one male, and the

 

other female, wandered about in the deserts, before they under-stood the use of any sign.”

 

“Let me then be permitted to make the supposi

tion, and the question will be to know, in what

 

manner this nation first invented language.” 57 This discourse, this detour, had already been

 

prac

ticed by Warburton—Condillac cites him—and what Kant will borrow in

((255))

Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft * 

will at least be analogous.

If there was then a slight shift from the 

Discourse 

to the 

Essay, 

it is the result of that

 

continuous sliding, that slow transition from pure nature to the birth of society. But this

 

evidence is not so simple. For no continuity from inarticulate to articulate, from pure nature to

 

culture, from plenitude to the play of supplementarity, is possible. The 

Essay, 

having to

 

describe the 

birth, 

the being-born of the supplement, must reconcile the two times. 

The

 

departure from nature is at once progressive and brutal, instantaneous and interminable. 

The

 

structural caesura is trenchant but the historical separation is slow, laborious, progressive,

 

imperceptible. On the issue of that double temporality, the 

Essay 

again agrees with the.Dis

-

course. 58

That 

“Simple Movement of the Finger.” Writing and the Prohibition of Incest. 

Society at birth

 

is effectively subjected, according to the 

Essay, 

to a sort of law of three conditions. But,

 

among the “three conditions of man considered in relation to society” (Chap. 9) or “the three

 

different stages according to which one can consider man assembled into a nation” (Chap. 5),

 

only the last marks man’s access to himself within society. It is the condition of civil and

 

ploughing man. The two preceding states (savage hunter and barbaric shepherd) still belong to

 

a sort of prehistory. That which primarily interests Rousseau is therefore the passage from the

 

second into the third condition.




This passage was in fact extremely slow, uncertain, and precarious, but since nothing in the

 

previous state contained the structural ingredient to produce the subsequent one, the

 

genealogy must describe a rupture or a reversal, a revolution or a catastrophe.

The second 

Discourse 

often speaks of revolution. If the word “ca

tastrophe” is pronounced

 

only once in the 

Essay, 

the concept is ever-present there. And it is not, as has been said, a

 

weakness of the system; it is prescribed by the chain of all the other concepts.

Why is the origin of civil man, the origin of languages, etc., the origin, in a word, of the

 

supplementary structure, and, as we shall see, the origin of writing also, catastrophic? Why

 

does it follow an upheaval in the form of reversal, of return, of revolution, of a progressive

 

movement in the form of a regression?

If we follow the anthropo-geographic theme and the schema of the natural explanation that

 

orient the chapters on the formation of lan

guages, it is indeed necessary that such a

 

catastrophe appear there first as

((256))

a terrestrial revolution. Without it, man would never have left the “golden centuries” of

 

“barbarism.” Nothing within the system of barbarism could produce a force of rupture or a

 

reason for leaving it. The causality of the rupture had therefore to be at once natural and

 

exterior to the system of the precivil state. The terrestrial revolution responds to these two

 

exigencies. It is evoked at a point which is strictly the center of the Essay:

The gentle climates, the fat and fertile lands, have been the first to be inhabited and the last in

 

which nations formed, because in them men could do without one another more easily than

 

elsewhere and because there the needs which give rise to social structures make themselves

 

felt later.

Supposing eternal spring on the earth; supposing plenty of water, livestock, and pasture, and

 

supposing that men, as they leave the hands of nature, were once spread out in the midst of all

 

that, I cannot imagine how they would ever be in

duced to give up their primitive liberty,

 

abandoning the isloated pastoral life so fitted to their natural indolence, 

59

 to impose upon

 

themselves unnecessarily the labors and the inevitable misery of a social mode of life.

He who willed man to be social, by the touch of a finger shifted the globe’s axis into line with

 

the axis of the universe. I see such 

a slight movement 

changing the face of the earth and

 

deciding the vocation of mankind: in the distance I hear the joyous cries of an insane

 




multitude; I see the building of castles and cities; I see the birth of the arts; I see nations

 

forming, expanding, and dis-solving, following each other like ocean waves; I see men

 

gathered together at certain points of their homeland for their mutual development, turning the

 

rest of the world into a hideous desert: fitting monument to social union and the usefulness of

 

the arts. [Essay, pp. 38-39; italics added]

The natural indolence of the barbarian is not one empirical char

acteristic among others. It is

 

an originary determination indispensable to the natural system. It explains that man could not

 

leave barbarism and its golden century spontaneously; he did not have within himself the

 

motion for going further. Rest is natural. The origin and the end are inertia. Since disturbance

 

cannot be born out of rest, it could not encroach upon the state of man and the corresponding

 

terrestrial state, upon the barbarian and upon perpetual spring, except through a catastrophe:

 

the effect of a strictly unpredictable force within the system of the world. That is why the

 

anthropological attribute of indolence must correspond to the geo-logical principle of inertia.

As the catastrophe of disturbance and seasonal differentiation could not be logically produced

 

from within an inert system, one must imagine the unimaginable: a little push entirely exterior

 

to Nature. This apparently “arbitrary” 60 explanation responds to a profound necessity and

 

thus recon

ciles many exigencies. Negativity, the origin of evil, of society, of articula

tion,

 

comes 

from without. 

Presence is surprised by what threatens it. On

((257))

the other hand it is imperative that this exteriority of evil be nothing or nearly nothing. The

 

little push, the “slight movement” produces a revolu

tion out of nothing. It suffices that the

 

force of the person who touched the axis of the globe with his finger should be exterior to the

 

globe. A nearly nonexistent force is a nearly infinite force when it is strictly alien to the

 

system it sets going. The system offers it no resistance; for antagonistic forces play only

 

within a globe. The slight push is almighty because it shifts the globe in the void. The origin

 

of evil or of history is thus nothing or nearly nothing. Thus is explained the anonymity of Him

 

who inclined the axis of the world with his finger. It is 

perhaps not God, 

since Divine

 

Providence, of which Rousseau speaks so often, could not have wished the catastrophe and

 

had no need of chance and the void in order to act. But 

it is perhaps God 

in as much as the

 

force of evil was nothing and supposes no real efficiency. 

It is probably 

God since His

 

eloquence and His power are at once infinite and encounter no commensurate resistance.

 

Infinite power: the finger that tips a world. Eloquence infinite because silent: a move-ment of

 

the finger is enough for God to move the world. Divine action con-forms to the model of the

 

most eloquent sign, that, for example, which obsesses the 

Confessions 

and the Essay. In both

 

texts, the example of the mute sign is the “simple movement of the finger,” the “little sign of

 

the finger,

” 61

 a “movement of the wand.”

Finger or wand is here a metaphor. Not that it designates another thing. It concerns God. God

 

has no hand, he needs no organ. Organic differentia

tion is the property and the misfortune of

 

man. Here the silent movement does not even replace an elocution. God has no need of a

 

mouth to speak, nor of articulating the voice. The 

Fragment 

on climates is here more em

-

phatic than the Essay:




If the ecliptic had been confused with the equator, perhaps there never would have been the

 

emigration of peoples, and each man, not being able to support a climate other than his native

 

one, would never have left it. To tip the axis of the world with a finger or to say to man: Cover

 

the world and be sociable, was the same thing for Him who needed neither hand to move nor

 

voice to speak (P.531).

It 

certainly concerns God, 

for the genealogy of evil is also a theodicy. The catastrophic origin

 

of societies and languages at the same time per

mitted the actualization of the potential

 

faculties that slept inside man. Only a fortuitous cause could actualize natural powers which

 

did not carry within themselves a sufficient motivation for awakening to their own end.

 

Teleology is in a certain way external; it is this that the catastrophic form of archeology

 

signifies. So much so that between the finger giving movement out of nothing and that auto-

affection of imagination which, as we have seen, 

awakens 

itself out of nothing and then

 

awakens all other potentiali-

((258))

ties, there is an essential affinity. Imagination is within Nature and yet nothing in Nature can

 

explain its awakening. The supplement to Nature is within Nature as its play. Who will ever

 

say if the lack within nature is 

within 

nature, if the catastrophe by which Nature 

is separated

 

from itself 

is still natural? A natural catastrophe conforms to laws in order to over-throw the

 

law.

There is something catastrophic in the movement that brings about the emergence from the

 

state of nature and in the awakening of the imagina

tion which actualizes the natural faculties

 

and essentially actualizes per

fectibility. This is a proposition of the 

Essay 

whose placing or

 

philo

sophical design is found at the end of the first part of the 

Discourse:

Having proved that the inequality of mankind is hardly felt, and that its influ

ence is next to

 

nothing in a state of nature, I must next show its origin and trace its progress in the successive

 

developments of the human mind. Having shown that human 

perfectibility, 

the social virtues,

 

and the other faculties which natural man potentially possessed, could never develop of

 

themselves, but must require the fortuitous concurrence of many foreign causes that might

 

never arise, and without which he would have remained for ever in his primitive condition, I

 

must now collect and consider the different accidents which may have improved the human

 

understanding while depraving the species, and made man wicked while making him sociable;

 

so as to bring him and the world from that distant period to the point at which we now behold

 

them (p. 162) [p. 190].

What we have called external teleology allows the stabilization of a sort of discourse on

 

method: the question of origin involves neither event nor structure; it escapes the simple

 

alternatives of fact and right, of history and essence. The passage from one structure to the

 

other—from the state of nature to that of society for example—cannot be explained by any

 

structural analysis: an external, irrational, catastrophic factum must burst in. Chance is not

 

part of the system. And when history is incapable of determining this fact or facts of this

 

order, philosophy must, by a sort of free and mythic invention, produce factual hypotheses

 




playing the same role, explaining the coming into being of a new structure. It would thus be

 

abusive to re-serve facts for history and right or structure for philosophy. So simplistic a

 

dichotomy is intolerable to a form of the question of origin which requires the intervention of

 

“very slight causes” whose “power” is “surprising.”

This will be a sufficient analogy for my not dwelling on the manner in which the lapse of time

 

compensates for the little probability in the events; on the sur-prising power of trivial causes,

 

when their action is constant; on the impossibil

ity, on the one hand, of destroying certain

 

hypotheses, though on the other we cannot give them the certainty of known matters of fact;

 

on its being within the province of history, when two facts are given as real, and have to be

 

connected by a series of intermediate facts, which are unknown or supposed to be so, to

((259))

supply such facts as may connect them; and on its being in the province of phi

losophy when

 

history is silent, to determine similar facts to serve the same end; and, lastly, on the influence

 

of similarity, which, in the case of events, reduces the facts to a much smaller number of

 

different classes than is commonly imagined. It is enough for me to offer these hints to the

 

consideration of my judges, and to have so arranged that the general reader has no need to

 

consider them at all (pp. 162–63) [pp. 190-91].

The passage from the state of the nature to the state of language and society, the advent of

 

supplementarity, remains then outside the grasp of the simple alternative of genesis and

 

structure, of fact and principle, of historical and philosophical reason. Rousseau explains the

 

supplement in terms of a negativity perfectly exterior to the system it comes to overturn,

 

intervening in it therefore in the manner of an unforeseeable factum, of a null and infinite

 

force, of a natural catastrophe that is neither in nor out of Nature and remains nonrational as

 

the origin of reason must (and not simply irrational like an opacity within the system of

 

rationality). The graphic of supplementarity is irreducible to logic, primarily because it

 

comprehends logic as one of its 

cases 

and may alone produce its origin. Therefore the

 

catastrophe of supplementarity, as that which procured for Jean-Jacques the “dangerous

 

supplement” and the “fatal advantage” is quite—in the words of the Confessions

—“inconceivable [to reason].” The possibility of reason, of language, of society, the

 

supplementary possibility, is inconceivable to reason. 

The revolution that gave birth to it

 

cannot be understood according to the patterns of rational necessity. The second 

Discourse

 

speaks of the “fatal accident”; Rousseau is in the process of evok

ing the budding—barbaric—

society between the state of nature and the state of society. It is the moment of the “perpetual

 

spring” of the 

Essay, 

“the most happy and durable epoch” of the 

Discourse.

The more we reflect on it, the more we shall find that this state was the least subject to

 

revolutions, and altogether the very best man could experience; so that he can have departed

 

from it only through some fatal accident, which, for the public good, should never have

 

happened (p. 171) [pp. 198–99].

What should never have happened had to come to pass. Between these two modalities is

 

therefore inscribed the necessity of non-necessity, the fatality of a cruel game. The

 




supplement can only respond to the nonlogical logic of a game. That game is the play of the

 

world. The world had to be able to play freely on its axis in order that a simple movement of

 

the finger could make it turn upon itself. It is because there was play in the move-ment of the

 

globe that a force almost nonexistent could, 

all at once, 

by a silent gesture, give its good or ill

 

fortune to society, history, language, time, relationship to the other, to death, etc. The

 

consequent “luck” and evil of writing will carry with them the sense of play. But Rousseau

 

does not

((260))

affirm 

it. He resigns himself to it, he retains its symptoms in the regulated contradictions of

 

his discourse, he accepts it and refuses it but does not affirm it. He who tipped the axis of the

 

globe could have been a player God, unknowingly risking the best and the worst at the same

 

time. But he is everywhere else determined as providence. By this last gesture and by all that

 

it commands in Rousseau’s thought, meaning is put out of play. As in all onto-theological

 

metaphysics, as already in Plato. And the condemna

tion of art, each time that it is univocal,

 

clearly testifies to it.

If societies are born in catastrophe, it means that they are born by acci

dent. Rousseau

 

naturalizes the Biblical accident: he makes a natural acci

dent of the Fall. But by the same

 

token, he transforms the throw of dice, the luck or checkmating of a player God, into a

 

culpable Fall. Between the accidents of nature and social evil, there is a complicity that,

 

moreover, manifests Divine Providence. Society is created only to repair the accidents of

 

nature. Floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and conflagrations no doubt terrified savages

 

but then made them come together “to recoup their common losses.” “[These are] the

 

instruments Providence uses to force people to reunite” 

[Essay, 

p. 40]. The formation of

 

societies played a com

pensatory role in the general economy of the world. Born of

 

catastrophe, society appeases unfettered Nature. It must in its turn have that regulatory role

 

without which the catastrophe would have been mortal. The catas

trophe itself follows an

 

economy. It is 

contained. 

“Since societies have been established, these great accidents have

 

ceased, or have become less frequent. It seems that is bound to be true even now. The same

 

evils that once united separated people would now tend to separate those who are united” 62

 

(Chap. 9) [p. 40].

Human war has the effect of reducing the war of natural elements. This economy clearly

 

shows that the degradation that came out of the catastrophe must be—as we have elsewhere

 

verified—compensated for, limited, regularized, by a supplementary operation whose pattern

 

we have outlined. “Otherwise I do not see how the system could be kept standing and

 

equilibrium be maintained. In the two types of order, the greater species will finally absorb

 

the lesser. The entire earth would soon be covered with nothing but trees and ferocious beasts,

 

and finally all would perish” 

[Essay, p. 

43]. There follows an admirable description of man’s

 

work where “the hand” holds back the degradation of nature and “retards this progress.”

The catastrophe opens the play of the supplement because it inscribes local difference. After

 

the unity of “perpetual spring,” it causes a duality of principles to follow: the polarity and

 

opposition of places (North and South), the revolution of seasons which regularly repeats the

 




catastrophe; 63 in some ways it makes place and climate change then and there, and finally

 

produces the alternation of hot and cold, water and fire.

((261))

Language and society institute themselves following the supplementary relationship of two

 

principles or series of significations (North/winter/ cold/need/ articulation;

 

South/summer/warmth/passion/accentuation).

In the North, in winter, when it is cold, need creates convention.

Forced to provide for winter, people living under such conditions have to estab

lish some sort

 

of convention among themselves in order to help each other. When the rigors of frigid

 

weather make it impossible to get about, boredom tends to unite them as much as need: the

 

Lapps, buried in ice, and the Eskimos, the most savage of people, huddle all winter in their

 

caverns, and then in sum-mer do not even know each other any more. Give them somewhat

 

greater de

velopment and enlightenment, and there you have them united forever. 

[Essay, 

PP.

 

40–411

Fire is a substitute for natural warmth, and the men of the North must assemble around a

 

hearth. Not only for the cooking of meat—and man in Rousseau’s eyes is the only animal

 

capable at the same time of speaking, living in society, and cooking what he eats—but for

 

dancing and loving.

Neither the stomach nor the intestines of man are made to digest raw meat, nor does it usually

 

suit his taste. With the possible single exception of the Eskimos, of whom I have just spoken,

 

even savages cook their meat. To the necessary use of fire for cooking is joined the pleasure it

 

gives to the eye and the warmth so comforting to the body. The sight of the flames, from

 

which animals flee, is attractive to man. People gather around a common hearth where they

 

feast and dance; the gentle bonds of habit tend imperceptibly to draw man closer to his own

 

kind. And on this simple hearth burns the sacred fire that provokes in the depths of the heart

 

the first feeling of humanity [ibid.].

In the South, the movement is inverse, it no longer leads from need to passion but from

 

passion to need. And the supplement is not the warmth of the hearth but the coolness of the

 

water hole:

In warm countries, unevenly distributed springs and rivers are even more neces

sary rallying

 

agents than other such factors, since people are less able to do without water than fire. The

 

barbarians especially, living off their herds, need common watering places. . . . The flowing of

 

waters can retard the society of people inhabiting well-irrigated places [ibid.].

This movement is no doubt the inverse of the preceding, but it would be wrong to conclude

 

that there is a symmetry. The privilege of the South is declared. To the structure of

 

reversibility that we have just described, Rousseau assigns an absolute and fixed beginning:

 

“the human race, born in warm lands:’ Reversibility is superimposed upon the simplicity of

 




the origin. The warm countries are closer to the “perpetual spring” of the Golden Age. They

 

are more in accord with the initial inertia. Passion there is closer to the origin, water is more

 

in touch than fire both with the first need and with the first passion.

((262))

More in touch with the first need because “people are less able to do without water than fire”;

 

and more in touch with the. first passion, that is to say with love, because its “first fires” arise

 

out of “the pure crystal of the fountains.” Thus the original language and society, as they arose

 

in warm countries, are absolutely pure. They are described closest to that ineffable limit where

 

society is formed without having begun its degrada

tion; where language is instituted but still

 

remains pure song, a language of pure accentuation, a sort of neume. It is no longer animal

 

since it expresses passion, but it is not completely conventional since it evades articulation.

 

The origin of this society is not a contract, it does not happen through treaties, conventions,

 

laws, diplomats, and 

representatives. 

It is 

a festival [fête]. 

It consumes itself in 

presence.

 

There is certainly an ex

perience of time, but a time of pure presence, giving rise neither to

 

calcu

lation, nor reflection, nor yet comparison: “Happy age when nothing marked the hours.”

 

64 It is the time of the 

Reveries. 

Time also without differance: it leaves no interval, authorizes

 

no detour between desire and pleasure: “Pleasure and desire mingled and were felt together.”

Let us read this page, no doubt the most beautiful in the Essay. It is never quoted, as it should

 

be every time the “transparence of the crystal” 

65

 is evoked.

... in the arid places where water could be had only from wells, people had to rejoin one

 

another to sink the wells, or at least to agree upon their use. Such must have been the origin of

 

societies and languages in warm countries.

That is where the first ties were formed among families; there were the first rendezvous of the

 

two sexes. Girls would come to seek water for the household, young men would come to

 

water their herds. There eyes, accustomed to the same sights since infancy, began to see with

 

increased pleasure. The heart is moved by these novel objects; an unknown attraction renders

 

it less savage; it feels pleasure at not being alone. Imperceptibly, water becomes more

 

necesasrv. The livestock become thirsty more often. One would arrive in haste and leave with

 

regret. In that happy age when nothing marked the hours, nothing would oblige one to count

 

them; the only measure of time would be the alternation of amusement and boredom. Under

 

old oaks, conquerors of the years, an ardent youth will gradually lose its ferocity. Little by

 

little they become less shy with each other. In trying to make oneself understood, one learns to

 

explain oneself. There too, the original festivals developed. Feet skipped with joy, earnest ges

-

tures no longer sufficed, the voice accompanied them in impassioned accents; pleasure and

 

desire mingled and were felt together. There at last was the true cradle of nations: from the

 

pure crustal of the fountains flowed the first fires of love [pp. 44-45].

Let us not forget: what Rousseau describes here is neither the eve of society nor society

 

already formed but the movement of a birth, the con

tinuous advent of 

presence. 

One must

 

give an active and dynamic meaning




((263))

to this word. It is presence at work, in the process of presenting itself. This presence is not a

 

state but the becoming-present of presence. None of the oppositions of determined predicates

 

can be applied clearly to what, between the state of nature and the state of society, is not a

 

state but a passage which should have continued and lasted like the present of the 

Reveries. 

It

 

is already society, passion, language, time, but it is not yet servi

tude, preference, articulation,

 

measure, and interval. Supplementarity is possible but nothing has yet come into play.

 

Rousseau’s festival excludes play. The moment of the festival is the moment of pure

 

continuity, of in-differance between the time of desire and the time of pleasure. Before the

 

festival, in the state of pure nature, there is no 

experience 

of the con

tinuous; after the festival

 

the experience of the 

discontinuous 

begins; the festival is the model of the continuous

 

experience. All that we can fix in the conceptual oppositions is therefore society formed on

 

the morrow of the festival. And these oppositions will first suppose the fundamental opposi

-

tion of the continuous and the discontinuous, of the original festival to the organization of

 

society, of the dance to law.

What follows the festival? The age of the supplement, of articulation, of signs, of

 

representatives. That is the age of the prohibition of incest. Before the festival, there was no

 

incest because there was no prohibition of incest and no society. After the festival there is no

 

more incest because it is forbidden. Rousseau declares this, and we are going to read it. But

 

since he says nothing about what happens in that place during the festival, nor in what the in-

differance between desire and pleasure consists, we may, at least if we wish to, complete this

 

description of the “first festivals” and lift the interdiction that still weighs on it.

Before the festival:

What then! Before that time did men spring from the earth? Did generations succeed each

 

other without any union of the sexes, and without anyone being understood? No: there were

 

families, but there were no nations. There were domestic, but not popular, languages. There

 

were marriages but there was no love at all. Each family was self-sufficient and perpetuated

 

itself exclusively by inbreeding. Children of the same parents grew up together and gradually

 

they found ways of expressing themselves to each other: the sexes became obvious with age;

 

natural inclination sufficed to unite them. Instinct held the place of passion; habit held the

 

place of preference. Thev became husband and wife without ceasing to be brother and sister.

This nonprohibition is interrupted 

after the festival. 

If we have paid at

tention to another

 

lacuna, to be sure very common, we shall be very little surprised by the omission of incest in

 

the evocation of the festival: describ

ing the nonprohibition, Rousseau does not mention the

 

mother at all, only the sister. 66 And in a note called forth by the word “sister” Rousseau ex-

((264))




plains with some embarrassment that the prohibition of incest had to follow the festival, and

 

be born of the act of birth of human society, and thus put upon it the seal of a 

sacred 

law:

The first men would have had to marry their sisters. In the simplicity of primi

tive customs,

 

this practice would easily perpetuate itself as long as families re

mained isolated, and 

even

 

after the reunion of the most ancient peoples. But the law that prohibits it is no less sacred for

 

its human institution. 

Those who see it only in terms of the bond it forms among families, fail

 

to see its most im-portant aspect. Given the intimacy that domestic life is bound to establish

 

between the two sexes, from the moment such 

a sacred law ceased to appeal to the heart 

and

 

mind there would be no more integrity among men and the most terrifying practices would

 

soon bring about the destruction of mankind (italics added) [pp. 45-46, n. 9].

In general, Rousseau gives a sacred and holy character only to the natural voice that speaks to

 

the heart, to the natural law, which alone is inscribed in the heart. There is 

only one 

institution,

 

only one 

fundamental convention that is sacred in his eyes: it is, as 

The Social Contract 

tells

 

us, the social order itself, the right of law, the convention that serves as founda

tion for all

 

conventions: “the social order is a sacred right which is the basis of all other rights.

 

Nevertheless, this right does not come from nature, and must therefore be founded on

 

conventions” 

(Social Contract, 

Bk. I, chap. I., P. 352)•

Does this not justify us in placing the prohibition of incest, the law sacred among all, on the

 

level of that fundamental institution, of that social order which supports and legitimizes all

 

others? The function of the prohibition of incest is neither named nor expounded in 

The

 

Social Con-tract 

but its place is marked as a blank there. Recognizing the family as the only

 

“natural” society, Rousseau specifies that it cannot maintain itself beyond biological

 

urgencies, except “by convention.” Now between the family as natural society and the

 

organization of civil society, there are relationships of analogy and corresponding image: “the

 

ruler corresponds to the father, and the people to the children; and all, being born free and

 

equal, alienate their liberty only for their own advantage” 

[Social Contract, 

p. 4]. One

 

element alone breaks this analogical rapport: the political father no longer loves his children,

 

the element of the law sets him apart. The first convention, which transformed the biological

 

family into a society of insti

tution, has thus displaced the figure of the father. But as the

 

political father must, in spite of his separation and in spite of the abstraction of the law he

 

incarnates, give himself pleasure, a new investment is necessary. It will have the form of the

 

supplement: “The whole difference is that, in the family, the love of the father for his children

 

repays him for the care he takes of them, while, in the State, the pleasure of commanding

 

takes the

((265))

place of 

[supplée] 

the love which the chief cannot have for the peoples under him” (p. 352)

 

[p. 4].

One can therefore separate with difficulty the prohibition of incest (sacred law, the 

Essay

 

says) from the “social order,” “sacred right which is the basis for all other rights.” If that holy

 




law belongs to the very order of the social contract, why is it not 

named 

in the 

exposition 

of

 

The Social Contract? 

Why does it only appear in a footnote in an unpublished 

Essay?

Everything in fact permits us to respect the coherence of Rousseau’s theoretical discourse by

 

reinscribing the prohibition of incest in this place. If it is called sacred although instituted, it is

 

because, although insti

tuted, it is universal. It is the universal order of culture. And Rousseau

 

consecrates 

convention only on one condition: that one might universalize it and consider it,

 

even if it were the artifice of artifices, as a quasi-natural law conforming to nature. That is

 

exactly the case with this prohibition. It is also the case of the order of that first and 

unique

 

convention, of that first unanimity to which, the 

Contract 

tells us “we must always go back”

 

(p. 359) [p. lo] for understanding the possibility of law. The origin of laws must be a law.

In the note to the 

Essay 

this law is obviously not justified. It must not be explained by social

 

circulation and the economy of kinship laws, by “the bond it forms among families.” All this

 

supposes the interdict but does not take it into account. What must make us turn away from

 

incest is described in terms where morality (“terrifying practices”) and a sort of biological

 

economy of the species (“the destruction of mankind”) mingle and are confused. Beside the

 

fact that these two arguments are hetero

geneous if not contradictory (it is the argument of the

 

kettle that Freud recalls in 

The Interpretation of Dreams), * 

neither of the two is intrinsically

 

pertinent to the argument: the morality that condemns incest is constituted from the interdict,

 

the former has its origin in the latter; and the biological or natural argument is ipso facto

 

annulled by what we are told of the Golden Age which preceded the interdict: generation

 

followed generation. “Even after the reunion of the most ancient peoples,” “this practice

 

continued without ill-effect”: this fact, which ought to limit the universal

ity of the sacred law,

 

does not stop Rousseau.

Society, language, history, articulation, in a word supplementarity, are bom at the same time

 

as the prohibition of incest. That last is the hinge 

[brisure] 

between nature and culture. This

 

statement does not name the mother in Rousseau’s text. But it shows her place all the better.

 

The age of the signs of institution, the epoch of the conventional relationships between the

 

representer and its represented belongs to the time of this interdict.

((266))

The natural woman (nature, mother, or if one wishes, sister), is a repre

sented or a signified

 

replaced and supplanted, in desire, that is to say in social passion, beyond need. She is in fact

 

the only represented, the only signified whose replacement by its signifier Rousseau

 

prescribes, thus exalt-ing the sanctity of the interdict. Not only does he accept but he

 

commands that, 

for once, 

one comply with the sacred obligation of the sign, to the holy

 

necessity of the representer. “As a general rule—“ one reads in 

Emile, 

“never substitute the

 

symbol for the thing signified, unless it is 

impossible to show the thing itself; 

for the child’s

 




attention is so taken up with the symbol that he will forget what it signifies” (pp. 189-90;

 

italics added) [p. 133].

Here, then, it is impossible to show the thing, but this impossibility is not natural. Rousseau

 

himself says so; it is moreover not simply one ele

ment of culture among others, since it is a

 

sacred and universal interdict. It is the element of culture itself, the undeclared origin of

 

passion, of society, of languages: the first supplementarity which permits the substitu

tion in

 

general of a signifier for the signified, of signifiers for other signifiers, which subsequently

 

makes for a discourse on the difference between words and things. So dangerous is this

 

supplementarity that one can only show it indirectly, by means of the examples of certain

 

effects derived from it. One can neither show it, nor name it as such, but only indicate it, by a

 

silent movement of the finger.

The displacing of the relationship with the mother, with nature, with being as the fundamental

 

signified, such indeed is the origin of society and languages. But can one speak of origins

 

after that? Is the concept of origin, or of the fundamental signified, anything but a function,

 

indispensable but situated, inscribed, within the system of signification inaugurated by the

 

interdict? Within the play of suplementarity, one will always be able to relate the substitutes to

 

their signified, this last will be yet another signifier. The fundamental signified, the meaning

 

of the being represented, even less the thing itself, will never be given us in person, outside

 

the sign or outside play. Even that which we say, name, describe as the prohibition of incest

 

does not escape play. There is a point in the system where the sig

nifier can no longer be

 

replaced by its signified, so that in consequence no signifier can be so replaced, purely and

 

simply. For the point of nonreplace

ment is also the point of orientation for the entire system of

 

signification, the point where the fundamental signified is promised as the terminal-point of

 

all references and conceals itself as that which would destroy at one blow the entire system of

 

signs. It is at once spoken and forbidden by all signs. Language is neither prohibition nor

 

transgression, it couples the two endlessly. That point does not exist, it is always elusive or,

 

what comes to the same thing, always already inscribed in what it ought to escape or ought to

 

have escaped, according to our indestructible and mortal desire.

((207))

This point is reflected in the festival, in the water hole 

[point] 

around which “feet skipped

 

with joy” when “pleasure and desire mingled and were felt together.” The festival 

itself 

would

 

be incest 

itself 

if some such thing

itself—could 

take place; 

if, by taking place, incest were not

 

to confirm the prohibition: before the prohibition, it is not incest; forbidden, it cannot become

 

incest except through the recognition of the prohibition. We are always short of or beyond the

 

limit of the festival, of the origin of society, of that present within which simultaneously the

 

interdict is (would be) given with the transgression: that which passes (comes to pass) always

 

and (yet) never 

properly 

takes place. It is always 

as if 

I had committed incest.

This 

birth of society is 

therefore not a passage, it is a point, a pure, fictive and unstable,

 

ungraspable limit. One crosses it in attaining it. In it society is broached and is deferred from

 

itself. Beginning, it begins to decay. The South passes into its own North. Transcending need,

 

passion engenders new needs which in turn corrupt it. Post-originary degradation is analogous

 




to pre-originary repetition. Articulation, substituting itself for passion, restores the order of

 

need. The treaty takes the place of love. Hardly attempted, the dance degenerates. The festival

 

becomes war. And already at the water hole:

The barbarians especially, living off their herds, need common watering places. And we learn

 

from the history of the earliest times that, in effect, this is where both their treaties and their

 

disputes originated.*

•

See Genesis XXI, for an example of each, between Abraham and Abimilech, concern-

ing the Well of Oath. [Essay, pp. 41—42]

The water hole is at the frontier of passion and need, culture and the earth. The purity of the

 

water reflects the fires of love; it is “the pure crystal of the fountains;” but water is not only

 

the transparency of the heart, it is also its freshness: the body—the body of nature, of the

 

herds and their barbaric shepherd—needs it in its dryness: “People are less able to do without

 

water than fire.”

If culture is thus broached within its point of origin, then it is not pos

sible to recognize any

 

linear order, whether logical or chronological. In this broaching, what is initiated is already

 

corrupted, thus returning to a place before the origin. Speech lets itself be heard and

 

understood in the South only through articulation, through chilling itself in order to express

 

need anew. It then returns to the North or, what comes to the same thing, to the south of the

 

South. The morrow of the festival resembles the eve of the festival infallibly and the point of

 

occurrence of the dance is only the un-graspable limit of their difference. The South and the

 

North are not territories but abstract places that appear only to relate to each other

((268))

in terms of each other. Language, passion, society, are neither of the North nor of the South.

 

They are the movement of supplementarity by which the poles substitute each other 

by turn:

 

by which accent is broached within articulation, is deferred through spacing. Local difference

 

is nothing but the differance between desire and pleasure. It does not, then, concern only the

 

diversity of languages, it is not only a criterion of linguistic classi

fication, it is the origin of

 

languages. Rousseau does not declare it, but we have seen that he describes it.

From here on, I shall constantly reconfirm that writing is the other name of this differance.

((269))

4. From/Of the Supplement to the Source: The Theory of

 

Writing

Let us close the angle and penetrate within the text to the place where writing is named and

 

analyzed for itself, inscribed within theory and placed in historical perspective. Chapters 5

 

“On Script,” and 6 “Whether It Is Likely that Homer Knew How to Write,” perhaps a little

 




artificially sepa

rated, are among the longest in the 

Essay, 

in any case the longest after the

 

chapter on the formation of southern languages. I have already called attention to the

 

alterations in the chapter on Homer: now it is a matter of reconstituting or maintaining the

 

coherence of the theory against a fact which seems to threaten it. If the song, the poem, the

 

epic are incompatible with writing, if writing threatens them with death, how do we explain

 

the coexistence of the two ages? And that Homer knew how to write, at any rate that he knew

 

writing, as the episode of Bellerophon 1 in the 

Iliad 

seems to testify? Rousseau takes note of

 

the fact but “stubborn in [my] paradoxes,” he describes himself as tempted to accuse the

 

“compilers of Homer.” Did they not write that history of writing after the fact, intro

ducing it

 

violently into poems that “for a long time ... were written only in men’s memories?” “What is

 

more, there are few traces of the art in the remainder of the 

Iliad. 

But I venture to suggest that

 

the whole 

Odyssey is 

just a tissue of inanities and stupidities that would be dissolved by

 

chang

ing a letter or two. Instead, the poem is made reasonable and fairly con

tinuous, by

 

presuming that these heroes did not know how to write. Had the 

Iliad 

been written, it would

 

have been sung much less.”

Thus a thesis without which the entire theory of language would founder had to be saved at all

 

costs. The sign of obstinacy which I have just quoted shows it well: these chapters on writing

 

are a decisive moment of the 

Essay. 

In addition they introduce one of those rare themes

 

which, treated in the 

Essay, 

are absent in the second 

Discourse; 

as themes articulated into an

 

organized theory, absent, in fact, from all other texts.

Why did Rousseau never finish or publish a theory of writing? Because he judged himself a

 

bad linguist, as he says in the draft of the preface? Be-cause the theory of writing is rigorously

 

dependent upon the theory of

((270))

language developed in the 

Essay? 

And if it were not so, would not this argument, reasonably

 

assumed, be all the more significant? Or further, is it because the 

Essay 

was supposed to be an

 

appendix to the second 

Discourse? 

Or because Rousseau, as he says in 

Emile, 

is “ashamed”to

 

speak of the non-sense that is writing? Why shame? What might one have invested in the

 

signification of writing in order to be ashamed to speak of it? to write of it? to write it? And

 

why is it nonsense, this operation in which one recog

nizes at the same time, notably in the

 

Essay, 

such dangerous and mortal powers?

At any rate the importance of these two chapters, the obstinate effort to consolidate a theory,

 

the laborious ruse to disqualify the interest in writing, are signs that one may not neglect.

 

Such is the situation of writing within the history of metaphysics: a debased, lateralized,

 

repressed, displaced theme, yet exercising a permanent and obsessive pressure from the place

 

where it remains held in check. A feared writing must be cancelled be-cause it erases the

 

presence of the self-same 

[propre] 

within speech.

The Originary Metaphor




This situation is reflected in the placing of the chapter “On Script” in the 

Essay. 

How does

 

Rousseau in fact construct this theory of writing with the help of borrowed elements? He does

 

it after describing the origin of languages. It is the question of a supplement at the origin of

 

languages. This supplement lays bare an additive substitution, a supplement of speech. It is

 

inserted at the point where language begins to be articulated, is born, that is, from falling short

 

of itself, when its accent or intonation, marking origin and passion within it, is effaced under

 

that 

other 

mark of origin which is articulation. According to Rousseau, the history of writing

 

is in-deed that of articulation. The becoming-language of the cry is the move-ment by which

 

spoken plenitude begins to become what it is through losing itself, hollowing itself out,

 

breaking itself, articulating itself. The cry vocal

izes itself by beginning to efface vocalic

 

speech. It is indeed at the moment when it is a question of explaining this originary

 

effacement of what, 

prop

erly 

speaking, constitutes the spoken of speaking, that is to say the

 

vocalic accent, that Rousseau introduces his chapter on writing. One must deal with the

 

consonant—belonging to the North—and with writing at the same time. “On Script” must

 

first—in its first paragraph—evoke the 

obliteration 

of the accent or intonation by consonantal

 

articulation: 

effacement 

and 

substitution 

at the same time. We should reread that introduction

 

here:

Anyone who studies the history and progress of the tongues will see that the more the words

 

become monotonous, the more the consonants multiply; that, as accents fall into disuse and

 

quantities are neutralized, they are replaced [on 

supplée] 

by grammatical combinations and

 

new articulations. But only the pres-

((271))

sure of time brings these changes about. To the degree that needs multiply, that affairs become

 

complicated, that light is shed [knowledge is increased], language changes its character. It

 

becomes more regular and less passionate. It substitutes ideas for feelings. It no longer speaks

 

to the heart but to reason. For that very reason, accent diminishes, articulation increases.

 

Language becomes more exact and clearer, but more prolix, duller and colder. This

 

progression seems to me entirely natural. Another way of comparing languages and

 

determining their relative antiquity is to consider their script, and reason inversely from the

 

degree of perfection of this art. The cruder the writing, the more ancient the language.

The progress of writing is thus a natural progress. And it is a progress of reason. Progress as

 

regression is the growth of reason as writing. ‘Why is that dangerous progress 

natural? 

No

 

doubt because it is 

necessary. 

But also because necessity operates within language and

 

society, according to ways and powers that belong to the state of pure 

nature. 

A pattern that

 

we have already encountered: it is need and not passion that substitutes light for heat, clarity

 

for desire, precision for strength, ideas for sentiment, reason for heart, articulation for accent.

 

The natural, that which was inferior and anterior to language, acts within language 

after the

 

fact, 

operates there after the origin, and provokes decadence or regression. It then becomes the

 

posterior seizing the superior and dragging it toward the inferior. Such would be the strange

 

time, the indescribable diagram of writing, the un-representable movement of its forces and its

 

menaces.




In what consists the 

precision 

and the 

exactitude 

of language, that lodg

ing of writing? Above

 

all in 

literalness [propriété]. 

A precise and exact language should be absolutely univocal and

 

literal 

[propre] : 

nonmetaphor

ical. The language is written, and pro-regresses, to the extent

 

that it masters or effaces the figure in itself.

Effaces, that is, its origin. For language is originarily metaphorical. Ac-cording to Rousseau it

 

derives this from its mother, passion. Metaphor is the characteristic that relates language to its

 

origin. Writing would then be the obliteration of this characteristic, the “maternal

 

characteristics” (cf. above, pp. 285, 199-200). It is therefore here that we must discuss “That

 

the first language had to be figurative” (Chap. 3), a proposition that is explicit only in the

 

Essay:

As man’s first motives for speaking were of the passions, his first expressions were tropes.

 

Figurative language was the first to be born. Proper meaning was dis-covered last. One calls

 

things by their true name only when one sees them in their true form. At first only poetry was

 

spoken; there was no hint of reasoning until much later [p. 12].

Epic or lyric, story or song, archaic speech is necessarily poetic. Poetry, the first literary form,

 

is metaphorical in essence. Rousseau belongs there

fore—he could not be otherwise, and to

 

make note of it is more than banal

((272))

•

to the tradition which determines literary writing in terms of the speech present in the

 

story or song; literary literality would be a supplementary accessory fixing or coagulating the

 

poem,,representing the metaphor. The literary object would have no specificity; at the most

 

that of an unhappy negative of the poetic. In spite of what I have said about literary urgency

 

as he lived it, Rousseau is at ease within this tradition. All that one might call literary

 

modernity tries on the contrary to mark literary specificity against subjugation to the poetic,

 

that is to say to the metaphoric, to what Rousseau himself analyses as spontaneous language.

 

If there is a literary originality, which is by no means a simple certainty, it must free itself if

 

not from the metaphor, which tradition too has judged reducible, at least from the savage

 

spontaneity of the figure as it appears in nonliterary lan

guage. This modern protestation can

 

be triumphant or, in Kafka’s manner, denuded of all illusion, despairing, and no doubt more

 

lucid: literature, which lives by being outside of itself, within the figures of a language which

 

is primarily not its own, would die as well through a reentry into itself by way of the

 

nonmetaphor. “From a letter: ‘During this dreary winter I warm myself by it.’ Metaphors are

 

one among many things which make me despair of writing 

[Schreiben]. 

Writing’s lack of

 

independence of the world, its dependence on the maid who tends the fire, on the cat warming

 

itself by the stove; it is even dependent on the poor old human being warming himself by the

 

stove. All these are independent activities ruled by their own laws; only writing is helpless,

 

cannot live in itself, is a joke and a despair” (Kafka, 

Journal, 

6 November 1921) .*

“

That the First Language Had To Be Figurative:” although this propo

sition was not peculiar to

 

Rousseau, although he might have encountered it in Vico, 2 although he must not only but

 

surely have read it in Condillac who must not only but surely have taken it from Warburton,

 

we must emphasize the originality of the 

Essay.

“

I was, perhaps, the first who discovered his abilities,” says Rousseau of Condillac,

 

remembering their “tête-à-tête” at the moment that the latter was “engaged upon his ‘Essay sur

 




l’Origine des connaissances humaines’ “ 

(Confessions, 

p. 347) [pp. 356-57]. Rousseau is

 

closer to Condillac than to Warburton. 

The Essay on Hieroglyphics is 

certainly governed by

 

the theme of a language originarily figurative and it inspired, among other articles of the

 

Encyclopaedia, 

that on the metaphor, one of the richest. But unlike Vico, Condillac, 3 and

 

Rousseau, Warburton thinks that the originary meta

phor does not come from “the warmth of a

 

Poetic Fancy, as is commonly supposed.” “The Metaphor arose as evidently from the

 

Rusticity of Con

ception

” 4 [Warburton, II: 147]. If the first metaphor is not poetic, it is

((273))

because it is not sung but acted out. According to Warburton, one passes through a continuous

 

transition from a language of action to a language of speech. That will also be Condillac’s

 

thesis. Rousseau is therefore the Only one to indicate an absolute break between the language

 

of action or the language of need, and speech or the language of passion. Without criticiz

ing

 

Condillac directly on this point, Rousseau opposes him after a fashion. For Condillac, “speech

 

succeeding the language of action, retained its char

acter. This new method of communicating

 

our thoughts could not be imagined without imitating the first. In order then to supply the

 

place of violent contorsions of the body, the voice was raised and depressed by very sensible

 

intervals” (II,I,11,Sec. 13) [pp. 179-80]. This analogy and con

tinuity are incompatible with

 

Rousseau’s theses about the formation of languages and local differences. For both Condillac

 

and Rousseau the North certainly inclines toward precision, exactitude, and rationality. But

 

for opposite reasons: for Rousseau the distance from the origin increases the influence of the

 

language of action, for Condillac it reduces it, since for him everything begins through the

 

language of action being continued within speech: “Precision of style was much sooner

 

received among the northern nations. In consequence of their cold and phlegmatic constitu

-

tions, they were readier to part with any thing that resembled the mode of speaking by action.

 

Every where else the influence of this manner of communicating their thoughts subsisted a

 

long time. Even now, in the southern parts of Asia, pleonasms are considered as an elegance

 

of speech.” Sec. 67. “Style was originally poetical” (p. 149) [p. 228].

Condillac’s position is more difficult to maintain. He must reconcile a poetic origin

 

(Rousseau) and a practical origin (Warburton). Through the weaving of these difficulties and

 

differences, Rousseau’s intention becomes precise. History goes toward the North as it parts

 

from the origin. But whereas for Condillac this distancing follows a simple, straight, and con

-

tinuous line, for Rousseau it leads to a place before the origin, toward the nonmetaphoric, the

 

language of needs and the language of action.




In spite of all his borrowings, all his convergences, the system of the Essay thus remains

 

original. In spite of all difficulties, the caesura between the gesture and the spoken word,

 

between need and passion, is main

tained there:

It seems then that need dictated the first gestures, while the passions wrung forth the first

 

words. By pursuing the course of the facts with these distinctions we may be able to see the

 

question of the origin of language in an entirely new light. The genius of oriental languages,

 

the oldest known, absolutely refutes the assumption of a didactic progression in their

 

development. These languages are not at all systematic or rational. They are vital and

 

figurative. The language of the first men is represented to us as the tongues of geometers, but

 

we see that they were the tongues of poets [p. 11].

((274))

The distinction between need and passion is justified in the last in-stance only by the concept

 

of “pure nature.” The functional necessity of this limit-concept and of this juridical fiction

 

also appears from this point of view. For the essential predicate of the state of pure nature is

 

dispersion; 

and culture is always the effect of reconcilement, of proximity, of self-same

 

[propre] 

presence. Need, which manifests itself 

in fact before or after pas

sion, 

maintains,

 

prolongs, or repeats the original dispersion. As such, and to the extent that it is not born out of

 

an anterior passion that modifies it, it is the pure force of dispersion.

And so it had to be. One does not begin by reasoning, but by feeling. It is sug

gested that men

 

invented speech to express their needs: an opinion which seems to me untenable. The natural

 

effect of the first needs was to separate men, and not to reunite them. It must have been that

 

way, because the species spread out and the earth was promptly populated. Otherwise

 

mankind would have been crammed into a small area of the world, and the rest would have

 

remained uninhabited [p. 11].

If “all of this is not true without qualification,” it is because need, struc

turally anterior to

 

passion, can always in fact succeed it. But is it only a question of fact, of an empirical

 

eventuality? If the principle of dispersion remains active, is it an accident or a residue? In fact,

 

need is necessary to explain the eve of society, what precedes its 

constitution, 

but it is indis

-

pensable in accounting for the 

extension 

of society. Without need, the force of presence and

 

attraction would play freely, constitution would be an absolute concentration. One would

 

understand how society resists disper

sion, one would no longer be able to explain how it

 

distributes and differen

tiates itself within space. The extension of society, which can in fact

 

lead to the dislocation of the “assembled people,” does not contribute any the less to the

 

organization, 

the differentiation, and the organic division of the social body. In 

The Social

 

Contract, 

the ideal dimensions of the city, which must be neither too small nor too large,

 

require a certain extension and a certain distance among citizens. Dispersion, as the law of

 

spacing, is there-fore at once pure nature, the principle of society’s life and the principle of

 

society’s death. Thus, although the metaphoric origin of language can be analyzed as the

 

transcendence of need by passion, the principle of disper

sion is not alien to it.




In fact Rousseau cannot, as Warburton and Condillac do, allege the continuity of the language

 

of sounds and the language of action which kept us back in “crude conceptions.” He has to

 

explain everything in terms of the structure of passion and affectivity. He laboriously helps

 

himself out of the difficulty through a short cut that is very dense and complex under the

 

surface. What is his point of departure in that second paragraph of the third chapter?

Not the difficulty of accounting for metaphor by passion; for him that is

((275))

self-evident; but the difficulty of making the idea—in effect surprising—of a primitively

 

figurative language acceptable. For do not 

good 

sense and good 

rhetoric, 

which agree in

 

considering the metaphor a displacement of style, require that one proceed from the literal

 

[propre] 

meaning in order to con

stitute and define the figure? Is not the figure a transference

 

of the literal sense? a transport? Did the theoreticians of rhetoric known by Rousseau not

 

define it thus? Is it not the definition given by the 

Encyclopaedia? 5

To repeat the first springing forth of metaphor, Rousseau does not begin with either good

 

sense or rhetoric. He does not permit himself the use of literal meaning. And, situating himself

 

in a place anterior to theory and common sense, which allow the constituted possibility of

 

what they wish to deduce, he must show us how either common sense or stylistic science is

 

possible. Such is at least his project and the original aim of his psycho-linguistics of passions.

 

But in spite of his intention and all appearance to the contrary, he also 

starts, 

as we shall see,

 

from the literal meaning. And he does so because the literal [le propre] must be both at the

 

origin and at the end. 

In a word, he restores to the 

expression of emotions a 

literalness whose

 

loss he accepts, from the very origin, in the 

designation of objects.

Here is the difficulty and the principle of solution:

However, I feel the reader stopping me at this point to ask how an expression can be

 

figurative before it has a proper meaning, since the figure consists only of a transference of

 

meaning. I agree with that. But, in order to understand what I mean, it is necessary to

 

substitute the idea that the passion presents to us for the word that we transpose. For one only

 

transposes words because one also transposes ideas. Otherwise figurative language would

 

signify nothing [pp. 12-13].

Metaphor must therefore be understood as the process of the idea or meaning (of the signified,

 

if one wishes) before being understood as the play of signifiers. The idea is the signified

 

meaning, that which the word expresses. But it is also a sign of the thing, a representation of

 

the object within my mind. Finally, this representation of the object, signifying the object and

 

signified by the word or by the linguistic signifier in general, may also indirectly signify an

 

affect or a passion. It is in this play of the repre

sentative idea (which is signifier or signified

 

according to the particular relationship) that Rousseau lodges his explanation. Before it allows

 

itself to be caught by verbal signs, metaphor is the relation between signifier and signified

 

within the order of ideas and things, according to what links the idea with that of which it is

 

the idea, that is to say, of which it is already the representative sign. Then, the literal or proper

 




meaning will be the rela

tionship of the idea to the affect that it 

expresses. 

And it is the

 

inadequa

tion of the designation 

(metaphor) which 

properly expresses 

the passion. If fear

 

makes me see giants where there are only men, the signifier—as the idea of the object—will

 

be metaphoric, but the signifier of my passion will

((276))

be literal. And if I then say “I see giants,” that false designation will be a literal expression of

 

my fear. For in fact I see giants and there is a sure truth there, that of a sensible cogito,

 

analogous to what Descartes analyzes in the 

Regulae: 

phenomenologically, the proposition “I

 

see yellow” is unexcep

tionable, error becomes possible only in the judgment “the world is

 

yellow.” 6

Nevertheless, what we interpret as literal expression in the perception and designation of

 

giants, remains a metaphor that is preceded by nothing either in experience or in language.

 

Since speech does not pass through reference to an object, the fact that “giant” is literal as

 

sign of fear not only does not prevent, but on the contrary implies, that it should be nonliteral

 

or metaphoric as sign of the object. It cannot be the idea-sign of the passion without

 

presenting itself as the idea-sign of the presumed cause of that passion, opening an exchange

 

with the outside. This opening allows the passage to a savage metaphor. No literal meaning

 

precedes it. No rhetor watches over it.

We must therefore come back to the subjective affect, substitute the phenomenological order

 

of passions for the objective order of designations, expression for indication, in order to

 

understand the emergence of meta

phor, and the savage possibility of transference. To the

 

objection that the literal meaning is prior, Rousseau responds with an example:

Upon meeting others, a savage man will initially be frightened. Because of his fear he sees the

 

others as bigger and stronger than himself. He calls them 

giants. 

After many experiences, he

 

recognizes that these so-called giants are neither bigger nor stronger than he. Their stature

 

does not approach the idea he had initially attached to the word giant. So he invents another

 

name common to them and to him, such as the name 

man, 

for example, and leaves 

giant 

to the

 

false object that had impressed him during his illusion. That is how the figura

tive word is born

 

before the literal word, when our gaze is held in passionate fascination; and how it is that the

 

first idea it conveys to us is not that of the truth. What I have said of words and names

 

presents no difficulty relative to the forms of phrases. The illusory image presented by passion

 

is the first to appear, and the language that corresponded to it was also the first invented. It

 

subse

quently became metaphorical when the enlightened spirit, recognizing its first error,

 

used the expressions only with those passions that had produced them [PP. 12-131.

1. The 

Essay 

thus describes at the same time the advent of the meta

phor and its “cold”

 

recapture within rhetoric. One cannot, then, speak of metaphor as a figure of style, as

 

technique or procedure of language, except by a sort of analogy, a sort of return and repetition

 

of the discourse; then one deliberately passes through the initial displacement, that which ex-

pressed the passion literally. Or rather the representer of the passion: it is not fear itself that

 

the word 

giant 

expresses literally—and a new distinction




((277))

is necessary which would infiltrate as far as the literalness 

[propre] 

of ex

pression—but “the

 

idea that the passion presents to us” [Essay, p. 13]. The idea “giant” is at once the literal sign

 

of the representer of the passion, the metaphoric sign of the object (man) and the metaphoric

 

sign of the affect (fear). That sign is metaphoric because it is 

false 

with regard to the object; it

 

is metaphoric because it is 

indirect 

with regard to the affect: it is the sign of a sign, it

 

expresses emotion only through another sign, through the representer of fear, namely through

 

the 

false 

sign. It represents the affect literally only through representing a false representer.

Subsequently, the rhetor or the writer can reproduce and calculate this operation. The interval

 

of this repetition separates savagery from civility; it separates them within the history of the

 

metaphor. Naturally, this savagery and this civility interrelate within the condition of society

 

opened by passion and the primitive figures. The “enlightened spirit,” the cold clarity of

 

reason, turned toward the North and dragging the corpse of the origin, can, having recognized

 

“its first error,” handle metaphors as such, with reference to what it knows to be their true and

 

literal meaning. In the south of language, the impassioned spirit was caught within metaphor:

 

the poet relating to the world only in the style of nonliterality. The reasoner, the writer-

calculator, and the grammarian, knowingly and coldly organize the effects of the

 

nonliteralness of style. But one must also turn these re

lationships inside out; the poet has a

 

relationship of truth and literalness with that which he expresses, he keeps himself as close as

 

possible to his passion. Lacking the truth of the object, he speaks himself fully and reports

 

authentically the origin of his speech. The rhetor accedes to objective truth, denounces error,

 

deals with the passions, but all by virtue of having lost the living truth of the origin.

Thus, even while apparently affirming that the original language was figurative, Rousseau

 

upholds the literal 

[propre] : 

as 

arche 

and as 

telos. 

At the origin, since the first idea of

 

passion, its first representer, is literally ex-pressed. In the end, because the enlightened spirit

 

stabilizes the literal meaning. He does it by a process of knowledge and 

in terms of truth. 

One

 

will have remarked that in the last analysis, it is also in these terms that Rousseau treats the

 

problem. He is situated there by an entire naive phi

losophy of the idea-sign.

2. Does the example of fear come by chance? Does not the meta

phoric origin of language lead

 

us necessarily to a situation of threat, distress, and dereliction, to an archaic solitude, to the

 

anguish of dispersion? Abso

lute fear would then be the first encounter of the other as 

other: 

as

 

other than I and as other than itself. I can answer the threat of the other as other (than I) only

 

by transforming it into another (than itself), through alter-ing it in my imagination, my fear, or

 

my desire. “Upon meeting others, a savage men will 

initially 

be frightened.” Fear would thus

 

be the first pas-




((278))

sion, the mistaken face of pity of which we spoke above. Pity is the force of reconciliation and

 

presence. Fear would still be turned toward the immediately anterior situation of pure nature

 

as dispersion; the other is 

first 

encountered at a distance, separation and fear must be

 

overcome so that he may be approached as a fellow-being. From a distance, he is im-mense,

 

like a master and a threatening force. It is the experience of the small and silent 

[infans] 

man.

 

He begins to speak only out of these deforming and naturally magnifying perceptions. 7 And

 

as the force of dis

persion is never reduced, the source of fear always compounds with its

 

contrary.

The acknowledged influence of Condillac also makes us think that the example of fear is not

 

fortuitous. According to 

An Essay on the Origin of Human Knowledge, 

anguish and repetition

 

are the double root of language.

As for the language of action. The fact that language was given to man by God does not

 

forbid a search into its natural origin by a philosophic fiction which teaches the essence of

 

what was thus received. It does not suffice “for a philosopher to say a thing was effected by

 

extraordinary means.” It is “incumbent upon him to explain how it could have happened

 

according to the ordinary course of nature” [pp. 170-71]. It is the hypothe

sis of the two

 

children left in the desert after the Flood, “before they understood the use of any sign” 8 [p.

 

169]. These two children began to speak only in a moment of fear: to ask for help. But

 

language does not begin in pure anguish or rather anguish signifies itself only through

 

repetition.

It is held between perception and reflection and is here called imitation. Let us italicize:

Thus by instinct alone they asked and gave each other assistance. I say 

by in

stinct alone; 

for

 

as yet there was no room for reflection. One of them did not say to himself, 

I must make such

 

particular motions to render him sensible of my want, and to induce him to relieve me: 

nor the

 

other, I 

see by his motions that he wants such a thing, and I will let him have the enjoyment

 

[jouissance] of it: 

but they both acted in consequence of the want which pressed them most. .

 

. . For example, he who saw a place in which he had been 

frightened, mimicked 

those cries

 

and movements which were the signs of fear, in order to warn the other not to expose himself

 

to the same danger. 9

3. The work which produces the common noun supposes, like all work, the 

chilling 

and

 

displacement 

of passion. One can substitute the adequate common noun 

(man) 

for the noun

 

giant 

only after the appeasement of fear and the recognition of error. With this work the

 

number and extension of common nouns (names) multiply. Here the 

Essay 

is in close accord

 

with the second 

Discourse: 

the first substantives were not common but proper




((279))

nouns or names. The absolutely literal 

[propre] is 

at the origin: one sign to a thing, one

 

representer per passion. It is the moment when the lexical ele

ment is as much the more

 

extended as knowledge is limited. 10 But that is true only of categoremes, a fact that ought to

 

raise more than one logical and linguistic difficulty. For the substantive as proper name is not

 

quite the first state of the language. It does not stand alone within the language. It already

 

represents an articulation and a “division of discourse.” Not that, in Vico’s manner, Rousseau

 

makes the noun be bom almost at the end, after onomatopoeia, interjections, first names,

 

pronouns, articles, but before verbs. The noun cannot appear without the verb. After a first

 

step, during which discourse is undivided, each word having “the sense of a whole prop

-

osition,” the noun is bom at the same time as the verb. It is the first inter-nal rupture of the

 

proposition that opens discourse. There are no nouns that are not proper, no verbal modes but

 

the infinitive, no tense but the present: “When they began to distinguish subject and attribute,

 

and noun and verb, which was itself no common effort of genius, substantives were at first

 

only so many proper names; the present infinitive 11 was the only tense of verbs; and the very

 

idea of adjectives must have been developed with great difficulty; for every adjective is an

 

abstract idea, and abstractions are painful and unnatural operations” (p. 149) 

[Discourse, 

p.

 

177].

This correlation of the proper noun and of the infinitive present is im-portant for us. One thus

 

leaves the present and the proper in the same movement: that which—distinguishing the

 

subject from subject with verb —and later distinguishing it from the subject with its attribute

—substitutes for the proper noun the common noun and the pronoun—personal or rela

tive—

trains the classification within a system of differences and substi-tutes the tenses for the

 

impersonal present of the infinitive.

Before this differentiation, the moment of languages “ignorant . . . of the division of

 

discourse” 

[Discourse, 

p. 

77] 

corresponds to that state suspended between the state of nature

 

and the state of society: an epoch of natural languages, of the neume, of the time of the Isle of

 

St. Pierre, of the festival around the water hole. Between prelanguage and the lin

guistic

 

catastrophe instituting the division of discourse, Rousseau attempts to recapture a sort of

 

happy pause, the instantaneity of a full language, the image stabilizing what was no more than

 

a point of pure passage: a lan

guage without discourse, a speech without sentence, without

 

syntax, without parts, without grammar, a language of pure effusion, beyond the cry, but short

 

of the hinge 

[brisure] 

that articulates and at the same time disarticulates the immediate unity

 

of meaning, within which the being of the subject distinguishes itself neither from its act nor

 

from its attributes. It is the moment when there are words (“the words first made use of by

 

mankind”)—which do not yet function as they do “in languages already

((280))

formed” and in which men “first gave every single word the sense of a whole proposition”

 

[Discourse, 

p. 177]. But language cannot be truly born except by the disruption and fracture

 

of that happy plenitude, in the very instant that this instantaneity is wrested from its fictive

 

immediacy and put back into movement. It serves as an absolute reference point for him who

 




wishes to measure and describe difference within discourse. One cannot do it with-out

 

referring to the limit, always already crossed, of an undivided language, where the proper-

infinitive-present is so welded to itself that it cannot even appear in the opposition of the

 

proper noun and the verb in the infini

tive present.

Language in its entirety, then, plunges into that breach between the proper and the common

 

nouns (leading to pronoun and adjective), be

tween the infinitive present and the multiplicity

 

of modes and tenses. All language will substitute itself for that living self-presence of the

 

proper, which, as language, already supplanted things in themselves. Language 

adds itself 

to

 

presence and supplants it, defers it within the indestructible desire to rejoin it.

Articulation is the dangerous supplement of fictive instantaneity and of the good speech: of

 

full pleasure 

[jouissance], 

for presence is always de

termined as pleasure by Rousseau. The

 

present is always the present of a pleasure; and pleasure is always a receiving of presence.

 

What dislocates presence introduces differance and delay, spacing between desire and

 

pleasure. Articulated language, knowledge and work, the anxious research of learning, are

 

nothing but the spacing between two pleasures. “We desire knowledge only because we wish

 

to enjoy” (Second 

Discourse, p. 

143 [p. 171]). And in 

The Art of Enjoyment, 

that aphorism

 

which speaks the symbolic restitution of the presence supplied in the past of the verb: “Say-

ing to myself, I enjoyed, I still enjoy.” 12 The great project of 

The Confes

sions, 

was it not also

 

to “enjoy [once more] . . . when I desire it” (p. 585) [p. 607]?

The History and System of Scripts

The verb “to supplant” or “to compensate for” 

[suppléer] 

defines the act of writing

 

adequately. It is the first and the last word of the chapter “On Script.” We have read its

 

opening paragraph. Here are the last lines:

Words [voix], not sounds 

[sons], 

are written. Yet, in an inflected language, these are the

 

sounds, the accents, and all sorts of modulations that are the main source of energy for a

 

language, and that make a given phrase, otherwise quite ordinary, 

proper only to the place

 

where it is. 

The means used 

to overcome [suppléer] 

this weakness tend to make written

 

language rather elaborately prolix;

((281))

and many books written in discourse will enervate the language. To say every-thing as one

 

would write it would be merely to read aloud (italics added) [p. 

22].

If supplementarity is a necessarily indefinite process, writing is the supplement par excellence

 

since it marks the point where the supplement proposes itself as supplement of supplement,

 

sign of sign, 

taking the place of a 

speech already significant: it displaces the 

proper place 

of

 

the sentence, the unique time of the sentence pronounced 

hic et nunc 

by an irreplace

able

 

subject, and in return enervates the voice. It marks the place of the initial doubling.




Between these two paragraphs: (I) A very brief analysis of the. diverse structures and the

 

general growth of writing; (2) starting from the premises of that typology and of that history, a

 

long reflection on alphabetic writing and an appreciation of the meaning and value of writing

 

in general.

Here again, in spite of massive borrowings, history and typology re-main most singular.

Warburton and Condillac propose the diagram of an economic, technical, and purely objective

 

rationality. The economic imperative must be under-stood here in the restrictive sense of

 

economies 

to be made: 

of 

abbreviation. 

Writing 

reduces 

the dimensions of presence in its

 

sign. The 

miniature is 

not reserved to illuminated capitals; it is, understood in its derivative

 

sense, the very form of writing. The history of writing would then follow the continu

ous and

 

linear progress of the techniques of abbreviation. The systems of script would derive from one

 

another without essential modification of the fundamental structure and according to a

 

homogeneous and monogenetic process. One script would not replace another except to gain

 

more space and time. If one believes the project of “the General History of Script” proposed

 

by Condillac,13 writing does not have a different origin from that of speech: need and

 

distance. Thus it continues the language of action. But it is at the moment that the social

 

distance, 

which had led gesture to speech, increases to the point of becoming 

absence, 

that

 

writing becomes necessary. (This becoming-absence of distance is not interpreted as a rup

ture

 

by Condillac but described as the consequence of a continuous in-crease.) From then on,

 

writing has the function of reaching 

subjects 

who are not only distant but outside of the entire

 

field of vision and beyond earshot.

Why 

subjects? 

Why should writing be another name for the constitu

tion of 

subjects 

and, so to

 

speak, of 

constitution 

itself? of a subject, that is to say of an individual held responsible (for)

 

himself in front of a law and by the same token subject to that law?

Under the name of writing, Condillac thinks readily of the possibility of such a subject, and of

 

the law mastering its absence. When the field of

((282))

society extends to the point of absence, of the invisible, the inaudible, and the immemorable,

 

when the local community is dislocated to the point where individuals no longer appear to one

 

another, become capable of being imperceptible, the age of writing begins.

... laws and public transactions, together with every thing that deserved the attention of

 

mankind, were multiplied to such a degree, that memory was too weak for so heavy a burden;

 

and human societies increased in such a manner, that the promulgation of the laws could not,

 

without difficulty, reach the ears of every individual. In order therefore to instruct the people,

 

they were obliged to have recourse to some new method. Then it was that writing was

 

invented: what progress it made I shall presently state (II. i. Sec. 73) [p. 232].




When mankind had once acquired the art of communicating their conceptions by sounds, they

 

began to feel the necessity of inventing new signs proper for perpetuating them, and for

 

making them known to absent persons (Sec. 127) [P. 273].

Since the operation of writing reproduces that of speech here, the first 

graphie 

will reflect the

 

first speech: figure and image. It will be pictographic. Again a paraphrase of Warburton:

Their imaginations then represented nothing more to them than those same images, which

 

they had already expressed by gestures and words, and which from the very beginning had

 

rendered language figurative and metaphorical. The most natural way therefore was to

 

delineate the images of things. To express the idea of a man or of a horse, they represented the

 

form of each of these animals; so that the first essay towards writing was a mere picture. 14

Like the first word, the first pictogram is therefore an image, both in the sense of imitative

 

representation and of metaphoric displacement. The in

terval between the thing itself and its

 

reproduction, however faithful, is traversed only by transference. The first sign is determined

 

as an image. The idea has an essential relationship to the sign, the representative substi-tute of

 

sensation. Imagination supplements attention which supplements perception. Attention may

 

have for “first effect” “to make those perceptions which are occasioned by their objects to

 

continue still in the mind, when those objects are removed” (I, ii, Sec. 17) [p. 38]. Imagination

 

permits “the representation of an object in terms of a sign, by its simple name, for example.”

 

The theory of the sensible origin of ideas in general, the theory of signs and of metaphoric

 

language which commands almost all eighteenth-century thought, here exhibits its Cartesian

 

critique of rationalism against an intact theological and metaphysical base. It is the original

 

sin, function-ing as did the Flood in the previous examples, which makes possible and

 

necessary the sensationalist criticism of innate ideas, the recourse to learning through signs or

 

metaphors, speech or writing, the system of signs (accidental, natural, arbitrary). “Whenever

 

therefore I happen to say, 

that

((283))

we have no ideas but what come from the senses, 

it must be remembered, that I speak only of

 

the state into which we are fallen by sin. This propo

sition applied to the soul before the fall, or

 

after its separation from the body, would be absolutely false. . . . I confine myself therefore, in

 

the fol-lowing work, to the present state of humanity” (I, i, 8, p .1o) [p. 18].

It is thus, as with Malebranche, for example, the very concept of experi

ence which remains

 

dependent on the idea of original sin. There is one law there: the notion of experience, even

 

when one would like to use it to destroy metaphysics or speculation, continues to be, in one or

 

another point of its functioning, fundamentally inscribed within onto-theology: at least by the

 

value of 

presence, 

whose implication it can never reduce by itself. Experience is always the

 

relationship with a plenitude, whether it be sen

sory simplicity or the infinite presence of God.

 

Even up to Hegel and Hus

serl, one could show, for this very reason, the complicity of a

 

certain sensa

tionalism and of a certain theology. The onto-theological idea of sensibility or

 

experience, the opposition of passivity and activity, constitute a profound homogeneity,

 

hidden under the diversity of metaphysical systems. Within that idea, absence and the sign

 




always seem to make an apparent, pro-visional, and derivative notch in the system of first and

 

last presence. They are thought as accidents and not as conditions of the desired presence. The

 

sign is always a sign of the Fall. Absence always relates to distancing from God.

In order to escape the closure of this system, it is not enough to get rid of the “theological”

 

hypothesis or obligation. If he denies himself the theological facilities of Condillac when he

 

looks for the natural origin of society, speech, and writing, Rousseau makes the substitutive

 

concepts of nature or origin play an analogous role. How can we believe that the theme of the

 

Fall is absent from this discourse? How especially when we see the disappearing finger of

 

God appear exactly when the so-called natural catastrophe comes about? The differences

 

between Rousseau and Condil

lac will always be contained within the same closure. One

 

cannot state the problem of the model of the Fall (Platonic or Judaeo-Christian) ex

cept within

 

this common closure. 15

The first writing is thus a painted image. Not that painting had served as writing, as miniature.

 

The two were at first intermingled: a closed and mute system within which speech had as vet

 

no right of entry and which was shielded from all other symbolic investment. There, one had

 

nothing but a pure reflection of object or action. “It is in all probability to the necessity of thus

 

delineating our thoughts that the art of painting owes its original; and this necessity has

 

doubtless contributed to preserve the language of action, as the easiest to represent by the

 

pencil” (Sec. 128) [p. 274].

This natural writing is thus the only universal writing. The diversity of scripts appears from

 

the moment the threshold of pure pictography is

((284))

crossed. That would be a simple origin. Condillac, following Warburton in this, engenders or

 

rather deduces all other types and all other stages of writing out of this natural system. 16

 

Linear progres will always be that of condensation, and of purely quantitative condensation.

 

More precisely, it will concern an objective quantity: natural volume and space. To this pro-

found law are submitted all displacements and all graphic condensations that only avoid it in

 

appearance.

From this point of view, pictography, the primary method that employs one sign per thing, is

 

the least economical. This squandering of signs is American: “Notwithstanding the

 

inconveniences arising from this method, the most civilized nations in America were

 

incapable of inventing a better. The savages of Canada have no other” (Sec. 129) [p. 274]. The

 

superiority of hieroglyphic script—“picture and character”—depends on the fact that “only a

 

single figure [is used] to signify several things” [pp. 275, 274]. Which supposes that there

 

might be—it is the function of the pictographic limit—something like a unique sign for a

 

unique thing, a supposition contradictory to the very concept and operation of the sign. To

 

determine the first sign in this way, to found or deduce the entire system of signs with

 

reference to a sign which does not belong to that system, is to reduce signification to

 

presence. The sign from then on is nothing but a disposing of presences in the library. The

 

advantage of hieroglyphs—one sign for many things—is reduced to the economy of libraries.

 




That is what the “more ingenious” Egyptians understood. They “were the first who made use

 

of a shorter method which is known by the name of hieroglyphics.” “The inconveniency

 

arising from the enormous bulk of volumes, induced them to make use of only a single figure

 

to signify several things.” The forms of displacement and condensation differentiating the

 

Egyptian system are comprehended within this economic concept and conform to the “nature

 

of the thing” (tn the nature of things) which it thus suffices to “consult.” Three degrees or

 

three moments: the part for the whole (two hands, a shield, and a bow for a battle in

 

curiologic hieroglyphs) ; the instrument—real or metaphorical—for the thing (an eye for

 

God’s knowledge, a sword for the tyrant); finally an analogous thing, in its totality, for the

 

thing itself (a serpent and the medley of its spots for the starry heavens) in tropical

 

hieroglyphics.

According to Warburton, it was already for economic reasons that cursive or demotic

 

hieroglyphics were substituted for hieroglyphics properly speak-ing or for sacred writing.

 

Philosophy is 

the name of what precipitates this movement: economic corruption which

 

desacralizes through abridging and effacing the signifier for the benefit of the signified:

But it is now Time to speak of an Alteration, which this Change of the Subject and Manner of

 

Expression made in the DELINEATION of 

Hieroglyphic

((285))

Figures. 

Hitherto the Animal or Thing representing was drawn out 

graphically; 

but when the

 

Study of Philosophy (which had occasioned 

Symbolic Writing) 

had inclined their Learned to

 

write much, and variously, that exact Manner of Delineation would be as well too tedious as

 

too voluminous; they therefore by degrees perfected another Character, which we may call the

 

Running Hand 

of Hieroglyphics, resembling the 

Chinese 

Characters, which being at first

 

formed only by the Outlines of each 

Figure, 

became at length a kind of 

Marks. 

One natural

 

Effect that this 

Running-Hand Character 

would, in Time, produce, we must not here omit to

 

speak of; it was this, that its use would take off much of the Attention from the 

Symbol, 

and

 

fix it on the 

Thing signified 

by it; by which means the Study of 

Symbolic 

Writing would be

 

much abbreviated, there being then little to do, but to remember the 

Power 

of the 

Symbolic

 

Mark; 

whereas before, the Properties of the Thing or Animal, used as 

a Symbol, 

were to be

 

learnt: In a Word, it would reduce this Writing to the present State of the Chinese. (I: 139–40)

 

[Warburton, p. 115]

This effacement of the signifier led by degrees to the alphabet (cf. pp. 125–26) [pp. 109-111.

 

This is also Condillac’s conclusion (Sec. 134).

It is therefore the history of knowledge—of philosophy—which, tending to multiply books,

 

pushes toward formalization, abbreviation, algebra. By the same movement, separating itself

 

from the origin, the signifier is hol-lowed and desacralized, “demotized,” and universalized.

 

The history of writing, like the history of science, would circulate between the two epochs of

 

universal writing, between two simplicities, between two forms of trans

parence and univocity:

 

an absolute pictography doubling the totality of the natural entity in an unrestrained

 

consumption of signifiers, and an absolutely formal 

graphie 

reducing the signifying expense

 




to almost nothing. There would be no history of writing and of knowledge—one might simply

 

say no history at all—except between these two poles. And if history is not thinkable except

 

between these two limits, one cannot dis-qualify the mythologies of universal script—

pictography or algebra—without suspecting the concept of history itself. If one has always

 

thought the contrary, opposing history to the transparence of true language, it was no doubt

 

through a blindness toward the archeological or eschatological limits, starting from which the

 

concept of history was formed.

Science—what Warburton and Condillac call philosophy here—the 

epistémè 

and eventually

 

self-knowledge, consciousness, would therefore be the movement of idealization: an

 

algebrizing, de-poetizing formalization whose operation is to repress—in order to master it

 

better—the charged sig

nifier or the linked hieroglyph. That this movement makes it necessary

 

to pass through the logocentric stage is only an apparent paradox; the privi

lege of the logos is

 

that of phonetic writing, of a writing provisionally more economical, more algebraic, by

 

reason of a certain condition of knowledge. The epoch of logocentrism is a moment of the

 

global efface-

((286))

ment of the signifier: one then believes one is protecting and exalting speech, one is only

 

fascinated by a figure of the 

techè. 

By the same token, one scorns (phonetic) writing because

 

it has the advantage of assuring greater mastery in being effaced: in translating an (oral)

 

signifier in the best possible way for a more universal and more convenient time; phonic auto-

affection, dispensing with all “exterior” recourses, permits, at a certain epoch of the history of

 

the world and of what one calls man, the greatest possible mastery, the greatest possible self-

presence of life, the greatest possible liberty. It is this history (as epoch: epoch not of history

 

but as history) which is closed at the same time as the form of being of the world that is called

 

knowledge. The concept of history is therefore the concept of phi

losophy and of the 

epistémè.

 

Even if it was only belatedly imposed upon what is called the history of philosophy, it was

 

invoked there since the beginning of that adventure. It is in a sense unheard of until now—all

 

idealist, or conventionally Hegelian follies of an analogous appearance not

withstanding—that

 

history is the history of philosophy. Or if one prefers, here Hegel’s formula must be taken

 

literally : history is nothing but the history of philosophy, absolute knowledge is fulfilled.

 

What exceeds this closure is 

nothing: 

neither the presence of being, nor meaning, neither

 

history nor philosophy; but another thing which has no name, which an

nounces itself within

 

the thought of this closure and guides our writing here. A writing within which philosophy is

 

inscribed as a place within a text which it does not command. Philosophy is, within writing,

 

nothing but this movement of writing as effacement of the signifier and the desire of presence

 

restored, of being, signified in its brilliance and its glory. The evolution and properly

 

philosophic economy of writing go therefore in the direction of the effacing of the signifier,

 

whether it take the form of for-getting or repression. Whether opposed or associated, these

 

two last concepts are equally inadequate. At any rate, forgetfulness, if one under-stands it as

 

the effacement of the power of retention by 

finitude, is 

the very possibility of repression. And

 

repression, that without which dissimula

tion would have no 

meaning. 

The concept of

 

repression is thus, at least as much as that of forgetting, the product of a philosophy (of

 

meaning).




Whatever it might be, the movement of the retreat of the signifier, the perfecting of writing,

 

would free attention and consciousness (knowl

edge and self-knowledge as idealization of the

 

mastered object) for the presence of the signified. The latter is all the more available because

 

it is ideal. And the value of truth in general, which always implies the 

presence 

of the

 

signified 

(aletheia 

or 

adequatio), 

far from dominating this move-ment and allowing it to be

 

thought, is only one of its epochs, however privileged. A European epoch within the growth of

 

the sign; and even, as Nietzsche, who wrenches Warburton’s proposition from its environment

 

and its metaphysical security, would say: of 

the abbreviation of signs. (So

((287))

that, let it be said in parenthesis, in wishing to restore a 

truth 

and an originary or fundamental

 

ontology 

in the thought of Nietzsche, one risks misunderstanding, perhaps at the expense of

 

everything else, the axial in

tention of his concept of interpretation.)

Repeating Warburton’s and Condillac’s statement outside its closure, one may say that the

 

history of philosophy is the history of prose; or rather of the becoming-prose of the world.

 

Philosophy is the invention of prose. Philosophy speaks prose, less in excluding the poet from

 

the city than in writing. In necessarily writing that philosophy in which the philosopher has

 

long believed, not knowing what he was doing, and not knowing that a most convenient

 

writing permitted him to do it, and that by rights he could have been satisfied to speak it.

In his chapter on the “Origin of Poetry,” Condillac calls it a 

fact: 

“At length a philosopher,

 

incapable of bending to the rules of poetry, was the first who ventured to write in prose” (Sec.

 

67) [p. 229]. He is writing of “Pherecydes of the Isle of Scyres ... , the first we know of who

 

wrote in prose.” Writing in the colloquial sense is by itself prosaic. It is prose. (On that point

 

too Rousseau is different from Condillac.) When writing ap-pears, one no longer needs

 

rhythm and 

rhyme 

whose function is, according to Condillac, to engrave meaning within

 

memory (ibid.). Before writing, poetry would in some way be a spontaneous engraving, a

 

writing before the fact. Intolerant of poetry, philosophy would have taken writing to be a fact.

It is difficult to 

appreciate 

what separates Rousseau from Warburton and Condillac here, and

 

to determine the 

value 

of 

the rupture. On the one hand, 

Rousseau seems to refine the models

 

which he borrows; genetic derivation is no longer linear or causal. He is more attentive to the

 

struc

tures 

of the systems of writing in their relationship to social or economic systems and to

 

the figures of passion. The appearance of forms of writing is relatively independent of the

 

rhythms of the history of languages. The models of explication are in appearance less

 

theological. The economy of writing refers to motivations other than those of need and action,

 

under-stood in a homogeneous, simplistic, and objectivistic sense. But 

on the other hand, 

he

 

neutralizes what is irreducibly 

economic 

in the system of Warburton and Condillac. And we

 

know how the ruses of theological reason work within his discourse.

Let us approach his text. To the technical and economic imperatives of objective space,

 

Rousseau’s explication makes only one concession. It is in order discreetly to correct

 

Warburton’s and Condillac’s simplism.




It is a matter of 

writing by furrows. 

The furrow is the line, as the plough-man traces it: the

 

road—via rupta—broken by the ploughshare. The furrow of agriculture, we remind ourselves,

 

opens nature to culture (cultivation). And one also knows that writing is bom with agriculture

 

which happens only with sedentarization.

((288))

How does the ploughman proceed?

Economically. Arrived at the end of the furrow, he does not return to the point of departure.

 

He turns ox and plough around. And proceeds in the opposite direction. Saving of time, space,

 

and energy. Improvement of efficiency and reduction of working time. Writing by the 

turning

 

of the ox —boustrophedon—writing 

by furrows was a movement in linear and phonographic

 

script. 17 At the end of the line travelled from left to right, one re

sumes from right to left.

 

Why was it abandoned at a given moment by the Greeks, for example? Why did the economy

 

of the writer 

[scripteur] 

break with that of the ploughman? Why is the space of the one not

 

the space of the other? If space were “objective,” geometric, ideal, no difference in econ

omy

 

would be possible between the two systems of incision.

But the space of geometric objectivity is an object or an ideal signified produced at a moment

 

of writing. Before it, there is no homogeneous space, submitted to one and the same type of

 

technique and economy. Before it, space orders itself wholly for the habitation and inscription

 

in itself of the body “proper.” There still are factors of heterogeneity inside a space to which

 

one and the same “proper” body relates, and therefore there are different, indeed

 

incompatible, economic imperatives, among which one must choose and among which

 

sacrifices and an organization of hierarchies become necessary. Thus, for example, the surface

 

of the page, the expanse of parchment or any other receptive substance distributes itself

 

differently according to whether it is a matter of writing or reading. An original econ

omy is

 

prescribed each time. In the first case, and during an entire techno

logical era, it had to order

 

itself according to the system of the hand. In the second case, and during the same epoch, to

 

the system of the eye. In both cases, it is a matter of a linear and oriented path, the orientation

 

of which is not indifferent and reversible in a homogeneous milieu. In a word, it is more

 

convenient to read than to write by furrows. The visual economy of reading obeys a law

 

analogous to that of agriculture. The same thing is not true of the manual economy of writing

 

and the latter was predominant during a specific era and period of the great phonographic-

linear epoch. The fashion outlives the conditions of its necessity: it continued till the age of

 

printing. Our writing and our reading are still largely determined by the movement of the

 

hand. The printing press has not yet liberated the organization of the surface from its

 

immediate servitude to the manual gesture, and to the tool of writing.

Rousseau, therefore, was already astonished:

At first they [the Greeks] adopted not only the characters of the Phoenicians, but also the

 

direction of their lines from right to left. Later it occurred to them to proceed as the plowman,

 

that is, writing alternately from left to right and right to left. Finally, they wrote according to

 

our present practice of starting




((289))

each line from left to right. This development is quite natural. Writing in the furrow fashion is

 

undoubtedly the most comfortable to read. I am even sur-prised that it did not become the

 

established practice with printing; but, being difficult to write manually, it had to be

 

abandoned as manuscripts multiplied. [Essay, p. 20]

The space of writing is thus not an originarily 

intelligible 

space. It begins however to 

become

 

so 

from the origin, that is to say from the moment when writing, like all the work of signs,

 

produces repetition and therefore ideality in that space. If one calls reading that moment

 

which comes directly to double the originary writing, one may say that the space of pure

 

reading is always already 

intelligible, 

that of pure writing always still 

sensi

ble. 

Provisionally,

 

we understand these words inside metaphysics. But the impossibility of separating writing

 

and reading purely and simply dis-qualifies this opposition from the beginning of the game.

 

Maintaining it for convenience, let us nevertheless say that the space of writing is purely

 

sensi

ble, in the sense that Kant intended: space irreducibly oriented within which the left does

 

not recover the right. One must also take into account the prevalence of one direction over the

 

other within the movement. For here it is the question of an operation, not just of a perception.

 

The two sides are never symmetrical from the point of view of the aptitude or simply the

 

activity of the body proper.

Thus the “return of the ox” is less suitable for writing than reading. Between these two

 

economic prescriptions the solution will be a labile compromise which will leave residues,

 

entail inequalities of development and useless expenses. Compromise, if one wishes, between

 

the eye and the hand. During the age of this transaction, one does not only write, one reads a

 

little blindly, guided by the order of the hand.

Should one still recall everything that such an economic necessity made possible?

This compromise is already very derivative, a late arrival, if one remem

bers that it prevails

 

only at a moment when a certain type of writing, itself charged with history, was already

 

practiced: linear phonography. The sys

tem of speech, of hearing-oneself-speak, auto-affection

 

that seems to suspend all borrowing of signifiers from the world and thus to render itself

 

universal and transparent to the signified, the 

phonè 

which seems to guide the hand, was never

 

able to precede its system nor, in its very essence, to be alien to it. It could only represent

 

itself as order and predominance of a temporal linearity by 

seeing 

itself or rather 

handling

 

itself, within its own self-reading. 

It is not enough to say that the eye or the hands speak.

 

Already, within its own representation, the voice is seen and maintained. 

The concept of linear

 

temporality is only one 

way 

of speech. This form of successivity is in return imposed upon the

 

phonè, 

upon consciousness and upon preconsciousness from a certain determined space of its

 

inscription.




((290))

For the voice is always already invested, undone 

[sollicitée], 

required, and marked in its

 

essence by a certain spatiality. 18

When I say a form is 

imposed, 

I obviously do not think of any classical model of causality.

 

The question, so often asked, of knowing if one writes as one speaks or speaks as one writes,

 

if one reads as one writes or con

versely, refers in its banality to an historical or prehistoric

 

depth more hidden than is generally suspected. Finally, if one notes that the place of writing is

 

linked, as Rousseau had intuited, to the nature of social space, to the perceptive and dynamic

 

organization of the technical, religious, eco

nomic and other such spaces, one realizes the

 

difficulty of a transcendental question on space. A new transcendental aesthetic must let itself

 

be guided not only by mathematical idealities but by the possibility of inscriptions in general,

 

not befalling an already constituted space as a contingent accident but producing the spatiality

 

of space. Indeed we say of inscription 

in general, 

in order to make it quite clear that it is not

 

simply the notation of a prepared speech representing itself, but inscription within speech and

 

inscription as 

habitation 

always already situated. Such a questioning, in spite of its reference

 

to a form of fundamental passivity, ought no longer to call itself a transcendental 

aesthetic,

 

neither in the Kantian, nor in the Husserlian, sense of those words. A transcendental question

 

on space con

cerns the prehistoric and precultural level of spatio-temporal experience which

 

furnishes a unitary and universal ground for all subjectivity, and all culture, this side of

 

empirical diversity, as well as the orientations proper to their spaces and their times. Now if

 

one lets oneself be guided by in

scription as habitation in general, the Husserlian radicalization

 

of the Kantian question is indispensible but insufficient. We know that Husserl reproached

 

Kant for having allowed himself to be guided in his question by ideal objects already

 

constituted into a science (geometry or mechanics) . To a constituted ideal space a subjectivity

 

constituted (into faculties) cor-responded naturally. And from my present point of view, there

 

is much to say on the concept of the 

line 

which so often intervenes in the Kantian critique.

 

(Time, the form of all sensible phenomena, internal 

and 

external, seems to dominate space,

 

the form of external sensible phenomena; but it is a time that one may always represent by a

 

line and the “refutation of ideal-ism” will reverse that order.) The Husserlian project not only

 

put all objec

tive space of science within parentheses, it had to articulate aesthetics upon a

 

transcendental kinesthetics. Nevertheless, in spite of the Kantian revolution and the discovery

 

of 

pure 

sensibility (free of all reference to sensation), to the extent that the concept of

 

sensibility (as pure passivity) and its contrary will continue to dominate such questions, they

 

will remain imprisoned in metaphysics. If the space-time that we inhabit is 

a priori 

the space-

time of the trace, there is neither pure activity nor pure passivity. This pair of concepts—and

 

we know that Husserl erased one with the

((291))

other constantly—belongs to the myth of the origin of an uninhabited world, of a world alien

 

to the trace: pure presence of the pure present, that one may either call purity of life or purity

 

of death: determination of being which has always superintended not only theological and

 

metaphysical but also transcendental questions, whether conceived in terms of scholastic the,

 

ology or in a Kantian and post-Kantian sense. The Husserlian project of a transcendental

 




aesthetics, of a restoration of the “logos of the aesthetic world” 

(Formal and Transcendental

 

Logic) * 

remains subjected to the in-stance of the 

living present, 

as to the universal and

 

absolute form of experi

ence. It is by what complicates this privilege and escapes it that we are

 

opened to the space of inscription.

Breaking with linear genesis and describing the correlations among sys

tems of script, social

 

structures, and the figures of passion, Rousseau opens his questions in the direction that I have

 

indicated.

Three states of man in society: three systems of writing, three forms of social organization,

 

three types of passion. “These three ways of writing cor-respond almost exactly to three

 

different stages according to which one can consider men gathered into a nation” 

[Essay, 

p.

 

16]. Among these three manners, there are no doubt differences of “crudity” and “antiquity.”

 

But in as much as they can assure a chronological and linear localization, they interest

 

Rousseau but little. Many systems may coexist, a cruder system may appear after a more

 

refined system.

Here too all begins with painting. That is to say with savagery: “The primitive way of writing

 

was not to represent sounds, but objects them-selves.” Is this painting satisfied with

 

reproducing the thing? Does it cor-respond to that universal proto-writing that redoubles

 

nature without any displacement? Here the first complication is introduced. In effect Rous-

seau distinguishes between two pictographies. One proceeds 

directly 

and the other

 

allegorically, 

“whether directly as with the Mexicans, or by allegorical imagery, as previously

 

the Egyptians did” [p. 17]. And when he links them thus: “This stage corresponds to

 

passionate language, and already supposes some society and some needs to which the

 

passions have given birth,” he doe not designate the sole “Egyptian” or “allegorical” state

 

with any verisimilitude. Without which it would be necessary to con

clude that a writing—

direct pictography—could have existed in a society without passion, which is contrary to the

 

premises of the 

Essay. 

On the other hand, how should one imagine a direct, proper,

 

unallegorical painting in a state of passion? That too is contrary to the premises.

One cannot overcome this alternative without reinstating something unsaid: pure

 

representation without metaphoric displacement, the purely reflecting kind of painting, is the

 

first figure. In it the thing most faith-

((292))

fully represented is already no longer properly present. The project of repeating the thing

 

already corresponds to a social passion and therefore requires a metaphoricity, an elementary

 

transference. One transports the thing within its double (that is to say already within an

 




ideality) for an other, and the perfect representation is always already other than what it

 

doubles and re-presents. Allegory begins there. “Direct” painting is already allegoric and

 

impassioned. That is why there is no 

true 

writing. The dupli

cation of the thing in the painting,

 

and already in the brilliance of the phenomenon where it is present, guarded and regarded,

 

maintained, how-ever slightly, facing the regard and under the regard, opens appearance as

 

the absence of the thing in its self-sameness 

[propre] 

and its truth. There is never a painting of

 

the thing itself and first of all because there is no thing itself. If we suppose that writing had a

 

primitive and pictorial stage, it would emphasize this absence, this evil, or this resource which

 

forever shapes and undermines the truth of the phenomenon; produces it and of course

 

substitutes it. The original possibility of the image is the supplement; which adds itself

 

without adding anything to fill an emptiness which, within fullness, begs to be replaced.

 

Writing as painting is thus at once the 

evil 

and the 

remedy 

within the 

phainesthai 

or the 

eidos.

 

Plato already said that the art or technique 

(techn) 

of writing was a 

pharmakon 

(drug or

 

tincture, salutary or maleficent). And the disquieting part of writing had already been

 

experienced in its resemblance to painting. Writing is 

like 

painting, like the 

zoographeme,

 

which is itself determined (cf. 

Cratylus, 

430-32) within a problematic of 

mimesis;

 

resemblance is troubling: “I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately like

 

painting” 

(zoographia) 

(275d). Here painting—zoography—betrays being and speech, words

 

and things themselves because it freezes them. Its offshoots seem to be living things but when

 

one questions them, they no longer respond. Zoography has brought death. The same goes for

 

writing. No one, and certainly not the father, is there when one questions. Rousseau would

 

approve without reservations. Writing carries death. One could play on this: writing as

 

zoography as that painting of the living which stabilizes animality, is, according to Rousseau,

 

the writing of savages. Who are also, as we know, only hunters: men of the 

zoogreia, 

of the

 

capture of the living. Writing would indeed be the pictorial representation of the hunted beast:

 

magical capture and murder.

Another difficulty in this concept of proto-writing: no recourse to convention is made there.

 

The latter appears only in the “second way”: moment of barbarism and of the ideogram. The

 

hunter paints beings, the shepherd already inscribes languages: “The second way is to

 

represent words and propositions by conventional characters. That can be done only when the

 

language is completely formed and an entire people is united by com

mon laws; for this

 

already presupposes a twofold convention. Such is the

((293))

writing of the Chinese; it truly represents sounds and speaks to the eyes” 

[Essay, 

p. 17].

One may conclude from this that, in the first state, metaphor did not give rise to any

 

convention. Allegory was still a savage production. There was no need of institutions to

 

represent beings themselves and metaphor here was the transition between nature and

 

institution. Then the proto

writing which did not paint language but painted things could make

 

shift with a language, therefore with a society which was not at all “completely formed.” This

 

first stage is always that unstable limit of birth: one has left “pure nature” but one has not

 

completely reached the state of society. The Mexicans and the Egyptians would have the right,

 

according to Rous-seau, to only “some society.”




The second manner paints sounds but without splitting up words and propositions. It would

 

thus be ideo-phonographic. Each signifier would refer to a phonic totality and a conceptual

 

synthesis, to a complex and global unity of sense and sound. One has not yet attained purely

 

phono-graphic writing (of the alphabetic types, for example) in which the visible signifier

 

refers to a phonic unity which in itself has no sense.

It is perhaps for this reason that the ideo-phonogram presupposes a “twofold convention:” that

 

which links the grapheme to its phonematic signified, and that which links this phonematic

 

signified, as a signifier, to its signified sense, to its concept, if one wishes. But in that context,

 

“two-fold convention” might also mean—it is less probable—something else: linguistic 

and

 

social convention. (“That can be done only when the lan

guage is completely formed and an

 

entire people is united by common laws.”) One does not need institutional laws for being

 

understood through the paintings of things and of natural beings, but one needs them for sta

-

bilizing the rules of the painting of sounds and of the unity of words and ideas.

However, Rousseau calls “barbaric” the nations capable of these “com

mon laws” and this

 

“twofold convention.” The use of the concept of barbarity in the 

Essay is 

very disconcerting.

 

Often (in Chapters 4 and 9) Rousseau makes it function in a perfectly deliberate, rigorous, and

 

system

atic way: three states of society, three languages, three scripts (savage/ barbaric/civil;

 

hunter/shepherd/ploughman; pictography/ideo-phonog

raphy/analytical phonography). Yet

 

elsewhere, an apparently looser use of the word (certainly of the word “barbarity” if not of

 

“barbaric”) desig

nates again a state of dispersion, whether it be of pure nature or of domestic

 

structure. Note 2 of Chapter 9 calls “savages” those whose barbarity is sub

sequently

 

described: “Apply these ideas to primitive men and you will see the reason for their barbarity.

 

. . . These barbaric times were a golden age, not because men were united, but because they

 

were separated. . . . Scat-tered over the vast wilderness of the world, men would relapse into

 

the

((294))

stupid barbarism in which they would be if they were bom of the earth” 

[Essay, 

pp. 

33, 36].

 

Domestic-barbaric society had no language. Familial idiom is not a language. “Living almost

 

without society, widely scattered, hardly speaking at all, how could they write?” Is not this

 

sentence in flagrant contradiction with the attribution, in Chapter 4, of a script and even of a

 

twofold convention to barbaric peoples?

No commentary can, it seems, efface this contradiction. An interpreta

tion may attempt it. It

 

would consist, uncovering a profound level of literal

ity while neutralizing another one more

 

superficial, of searching then within Rousseau’s text for the right to isolate relatively the

 

structure of the graphic system from the structure of the social system. Although the social

 

and graphic types correspond ideally and by analogy, a society of the civil type may have 

in

 

fact a 

writing of the barbaric type. Although bar

barians hardly speak and do not write, one

 

finds the characteristics of a cer

tain writing within barbarity. In saying thus that “the depicting

 

of objects is appropriate to a savage people; signs of words and of propositions, to a barbaric

 

people, and the alphabet to civilized peoples 

[peuples policés]” [Essay, 

p. 17], one does not

 

contravene the structural principle, rather one confirms it. In our society, where the civil type

 




has appeared, the elements of pictographic writing would be savage, the ideo-phonographic

 

elements barbaric. And who would deny the presence of all these elements in our practice of

 

writing?

For even while maintaining the principle of structural analogy, Rous-seau insists nonetheless

 

on preserving the relative independence of social, linguistic, and graphic structures. He will

 

say it further on: “The art of writing does not at all depend upon that of speaking. It derives

 

from needs of a different kind which develop earlier or later according to circumstances

 

entirely independent of the duration of the people, and which might never have occurred in

 

very old nations” [p. 19].

The 

fact 

of the appearance of writing is therefore not necessary. And it is this empirical

 

contingency which allows the putting in parenthesis of the fact in structural or eidetic

 

analysis. That a structure whose internal organi

zation and essential necessity we know should

 

appear in fact here or there, sooner or later, is, as I have noted elsewhere, the condition and

 

the limit of a structural analysis as such and in its proper moment. In its proper in-stance,

 

attention to the internal specificity of the organization always leaves to chance the passage

 

from one structure to another. This chance may be thought, as it is here the case, negatively as

 

catastrophe, or affirma

tively as play. This structuralist limit and power has an ethico-meta

-

physical convenience. Writing in general, as the emergence of a new system of inscription, is

 

a supplement of which one would wish to learn only the 

additive 

aspect (it 

happens

 

unexpectedly, at a stroke [sur-venu d’un coup], 

into the bargain) and the 

noxious 

influence

 

(arrives 

ill-advisedly, in addi-

((295))

tion [mal-venu, en plus], 

from the exterior, when nothing in the conditions of its past made it

 

necessary) . Not to attribute any necessity to its historical appearance is at once to ignore the

 

appeal of substitution and to think evil as a surprising, exterior, irrational, accidental and

 

therefore effaceable addition.

The Alphabet and Absolute Representation

Thus 

graphics and politics refer to one another according to complex laws. They must thus

 

both clothe the form of reason as a process of degradation which, between two universalities

 

and from catastrophe to catastrophe, 

should 

return to a total reappropriation of presence.

 

Should [devrait] : 

it is the mode and tense of a teleological and eschatological anticipation

 

that superintends Rousseau’s entire discourse. Thinking dif

ferance and supplementarity in this

 

mode and tense, Rousseau wishes to announce them from the horizon of their final

 

effacement.

In this sense, in the order of writing as in the order of the city, as long as the absolute

 

reappropriation of man 19 in his presence is not accomplished, the worst is simultaneously the

 

best. The furthest in the time of lost presence is closest to the time of presence regained.

Hence the third condition: civil man and alphabetic writing. It is here that, in the most

 

conspicuous and grave manner, law supplements nature and writing speech. In one case as in

 

the other, the supplement is repre

sentation. We recall the fragment on 

Pronunciation:




Languages are made to be spoken, writing is nothing but 

a supplement 

of speech. ... The

 

analysis of thought is made through speech, and the analysis of speech through writing;

 

speech 

represents 

thought through conventional signs, and writing represents speech in the

 

same way; thus the art of writing is nothing but a mediated 

representation 

of thought, at least

 

in the case of vocalic languages, the only ones that we use.

The movement of supplementary representation approaches the origin as it distances itself

 

from it. Total alienation is the total reappropriation of self-presence. Alphabetic writing,

 

representing a representer, supplement of a supplement, increases the 

power 

of representation.

 

In losing a little more presence, it restores it a little bit better. More purely phonographic than

 

the writing of the second condition, it is more apt to fade before the voice, more apt to let the

 

voice be. Within the political order—total alienation, that which develops, as 

The Social

 

Contract 

says, “without reserve”—“we gain the exact equivalent of what we lose, as well as

 

an added power to conserve what we already have” (Bk. I, p. 361) [p. 181]. On condition, of

 

course, that the emergence out of the anterior state—at the limit, from the

((296))

state of pure nature—does not make it fall back, as is always possible, short of the origin, and

 

consequently if “the misuse of the new conditions still, at times, degrades him [the human

 

being] to a point below that from which he has emerged” (p. 364) [p. 185].

Unreserved alienation is thus unreserved representation. It wrenches presence absolutely from

 

itself and absolutely re-presents it to itself. Since evil always has the form of representative

 

alienation, of representation in its dispossessing aspect, all Rousseau’s thought is in one sense

 

a critique of representation, as much in the linguistic as in the political sense. But at the same

 

time—and here the entire history of metaphysics is reflected—this critique depends upon the

 

naivete of representation. It supposes at once that representation follows a first presence and

 

restores a final presence. One does not ask how much of presence and how much of

 

representation are found within presence. In criticizing representation as the loss of pres

ence,

 

in expecting a reappropriation of presence from it, in making it an accident or a means, one

 

situates oneself within the self-evidence of the distinction between presentation and

 

representation, within the 

effect 

of this fission. One criticizes the sign by placing oneself

 

within the self-evidence and the effect of the difference between signified and signifier. That

 

is to say, without thinking (quite like those later critics who, from within the same 

effect,

 

reverse the pattern, and oppose a logic of the repre

senter to the logic of the represented) of the

 

productive movement of the effect of difference: the strange graphic of differance.

It is therefore not at all surprising that the third condition (civil society and alphabet) should

 

be described according to the patterns that are as much those of 

The Social Contract 

as those

 

of the 

Letter to d’Alembert.

Praise of the “assembled people” at the festival or at the political forum is always a critique of

 

representation. The legitimizing instance, in the city as in language—speech or writing—and

 

in the arts, is the representer present in person: source of legitimacy and sacred origin.

 

Perversity consists pre

cisely in sacralizing the representer or the signifier. Sovereignty is

 




presence, and the delight in 

[jouissance] 

presence. “The moment the people is legiti

mately

 

assembled as a sovereign body, the jurisdiction of the government wholly lapses, the

 

executive power is suspended, and the person of the meanest citizen is as sacred and

 

inviolable as that of the first magistrate; for in the presence of the person represented,

 

representatives no longer exist” 

(Social Contract, 

pp. 

4

27–29 [p. 76].

In all the orders, the possibility of the representer befalls represented presence as evil befalls

 

good, or history befalls origin. The signifier-repre

senter is the catastrophe. Therefore it is

 

always “new” in itself, in whatever epoch it might appear. It is the essence of modernity. “The

 

idea of repre

sentation is modern,” is a proposition which must be extended beyond the limits

 

that Rousseau assigns it (p. 430) [p. 78]. Political liberty is full only

((297))

at the moment when the power of the representer is suspended and given back to the

 

represented: “In any case, the moment a people allows itself to be represented, it is no longer

 

free: it no longer exists” (p. 431) [p. 80].

It is necessary, then, to reach the point where the source is held within itself, where it returns

 

or reascends toward itself in the inalienable im

mediacy of self-possession 

[jouissance de soi],

 

in the moment of the impos

sible representation, in its sovereignty. In the political order, that

 

source is determined as will: “Sovereignty, for the same reason as makes it in-alienable,

 

cannot be represented; it lies essentially in the general will, and will does not admit of

 

representation: it is either the same, or other; there is no intermediate possibility” (p. 429) [p.

 

781. “. . . The Sovereign, who is no less than a collective being, cannot be represented except

 

by himself: the power indeed maybe transmitted, but not the will” (p. 368) [p. 20].

As corruptive principle, the representative is not the represented but only the representer of

 

the represented; it is not the same as itself. As repre

senter, it is not simply the other of the

 

represented. The evil of the representer or of the supplement of presence is neither the same

 

nor the other. It intervenes at the moment of differance, when the sovereign will delegates

 

itself, and when, in consequence, law is written. Now the general will risks becoming a

 

transmitted power, a particular will, preference, in-equality. The decree, that is to say writing,

 

can be substituted for the law; in the decrees representing particular wills, “the general will

 

becomes mute” 

(Social Contract, 

p. 438) [p. 86]. The system of the social contract, which

 

founds itself on the existence of a moment anterior to writing and representation, can,

 

however, not avoid allowing itself to be threatened by the letter. That is why, obliged to have

 

recourse to representation, “the body politic, as well as the human body, begins to die as soon

 

as it is born, and carries in itself the causes of its destruction” (p. 424 [p. 73] Chapter 11 of

 

Bk. III, “Of the Death of the Body Politic,” opens all the developments of representation).

 

Writing is the origin of inequality. 20 It is the moment when the 

general will 

which cannot err

 

by itself, gives way to 

judgment, 

which can draw it into “the seductive influences of

 

individual wills” (p. 380) [p. 31]. One must therefore separate legislative sovereignty from the

 

power of 

drawing up 

laws. “When Lycurgus gave laws to his country, he began by resigning

 

the throne.” “He, therefore, who draws up the laws has, or should have, no right of legislation,

 

and the people cannot, even if it wishes, deprive itself of this incommunicable right” (pp. 382




—83) [pp.32—33]. It is therefore absolutely necessary that the general will express itself

 

through 

voices 

without proxy. It “makes law” when it 

declares 

itself in the voice of the “body

 

of the people” where it is indivisible; otherwise it is divided into particular wills, acts of

 

magistracy, decrees (p. 369) [p. 21].

But the catastrophe that interrupted the state of nature opens the move-ment of distancing

 

which brings closer; perfect representation should re-

((298))

present perfectly. It restores presence and effaces itself as absolute repre

sentation. This

 

movement is necessary 21 The telos of the image is it own imperceptibility. When the perfect

 

image ceases to be other than the thing, it respects the thing and restores originary presence.

 

Indefinite cycle: repre

sented source of representation, the origin of the image can in turn

 

represent its representers, replace its substitutes, supply its supplements. Folded, returning to

 

itself, representing itself, sovereign, presence is then—and barely—only the supplement of a

 

supplement. It is thus that the 

Discourse on Political Economy 

defines “the general will, the

 

source and supplement 

of all laws, [which] should be consulted whenever they fail” (p. 250;

 

italics added) [p. 242].* Is not the order of pure law, which gives back to the people their

 

liberty and to presence its sovereignty, always the supplement of a natural order somewhere

 

deficient? When the supplement accom

plishes its office and fills the lack, there is no harm

 

done. The abyss is the chasm which can remain open between the lapse of Nature and 

the

 

delay of the supplement: 

“The time of man’s most shameful lawlessness and greatest misery

 

was when, new passions having smothered natural senti

ments, human understanding had not

 

yet made sufficient progress to sub

stitute maxims of sagacity for natural impulses.” 22 The

 

play of the sup

plement is indefinite. References refer to references. The general will, that

 

“celestial voice” 

(Discourse on Political Economy, p. 248) 

[p. 240] is therefore the

 

supplement of nature. But when, by a return of catastrophe, society is degraded, nature can

 

substitute itself for its supplement. It is then a bad nature, “it is under these circumstances that

 

the voice of duty no longer speaks in men’s hearts, and their rulers are obliged to 

substitute

 

the cry of terror, or the lure of an apparent 

interest” 

(p. 253; italics added) [P. 245]

This play of the supplement, the always open possibility of a catastrophic regression and the

 

annulment of progress, recalls not only Vico’s 

ricorsi. 

Conjugated with what we have called

 

geometric regression, it makes his-tory escape an infinite teleology of the Hegelian type. In a

 

certain way, considering that history can always interrupt its own progress, (and must even

 

progress in regression), (re) turn behind itself, Rousseau does not make “the work of death,”

 

the play of difference and the operation of nega

tivity, serve in the dialectical accomplishment

 

of truth within the horizon of parousia. But all these propositions may be inverted. This

 

finitism of Rous-seau emerges also on the basis of a providentialist theology. Interpreting

 

itself, it effaces itself on another level as it reduces the historic and nega

tive to the accidental.

 

It too is thought within the horizon of an infinite restitution of presence, and so on. In the

 

closed field of metaphysics, what

((299))

I outline here as an indefinite exchange of “Rousseauist” and “Hegelian” positions (one might

 

take many other examples) obeys the laws inscribed within all the concepts that I have just

 

recalled. It is possible to formalize these laws and indeed they are formalized.

What I have just noted within the political order is applicable also to the graphic order.

Access to phonetic writing constitutes at once a supplementary degree of representativity and

 

a total revolution in the structure of representation. Direct or hieroglyphic pictography

 

represents the thing or the signified. The ideo-phonogram already represents a mixture of

 

signifier and signified. It already paints language. It is the moment located by all historians of

 

writing as the birth of phoneticization, through, for example, the picture puzzle 

[rebus à

 

transfert]

; 23 

a 

sign representing a thing named in its concept ceases to refer to the concept

 

and keeps only the value of a phonic signifier. Its signified is no longer anything but a

 

phoneme deprived by itself of all meaning. But before this decomposition and in spite of the

 

“twofold con

vention,” representation is reproduction; it repeats the signifying and signi

fied

 

masses en bloc and without analysis. This synthetic character of representation is the

 

pictographic residue of the ideo-phonogram that “paints voices.” Phonetic writing works to

 

reduce it. Instead of using sig

nifiers immediately related to a conceptual signified, it uses,

 

through the analysis of sounds, signifiers that are in some way nonsignifying. Letters, which

 

have no meaning by themselves, signify only the elementary phonic signifiers that make sense

 

only when they are put together according to certain rules.

Analysis substituting painting and pushed to insignificance, such is the rationality proper to

 

the alphabet and to civil society. Absolute anonymity of the representer and absolute loss of

 

the selfsame 

[le propre]. 

The culture of the alphabet and the appearance of civilized man

 

[l’homme policé] 

cor-respond to the age of the ploughman. And let us not forget that

 

agriculture presupposes industry. But then, how can we explain the allusion to the trader who

 

is in fact never named in the classification of the three condi

tions and thus seems to have no

 

appropriate era?

The third [way of writing] is to break down the speaking voice into a given number of

 

elementary parts, either vocal or articulate [vowels or consonants], with which one can form

 

all the words and syllables imaginable. This way of writing, which is ours, must have been

 

invented by commercial peoples who, in traveling to various countries, had to speak various

 

languages, which would have impelled them to invent characters that could be common to all

 

of them. This is not exactly to depict speech, but to analyze it [p. 171.

The trader invents a system of graphic signs which in its principle is no longer attached to a

 

particular language. This writing may in principle in-




((300))

scribe all languages in general. It gains in universality, it favors trade and makes

 

communication “with other people who [speak] other languages” [p. 17] easier. But it is

 

perfectly enslaved to language in general the moment it liberates itself from all particular

 

languages. It is, in its principle, a uni-versal phonetic writing. Its neutral transparence allows

 

each language its proper form and its liberty. Alphabetic writing concerns itself only with pure

 

representers. It is a system of signifiers where the signifieds are sig

nifiers: phonemes. The

 

circulation of signs is infinitely facilitated. Alpha

betic writing is the mutest possible, for it

 

does not speak any language immediately. But, alien to the voice, it is more faithful to it and

 

represents it better.

This independence with regard to the empirical diversity of oral lan

guages confirms a certain

 

autonomy of the growth of writing. Writing may not only be born earlier or later,

 

independently of the “duration of the people,” slowly or at one stroke; 24 in addition, it

 

implies no linguistic derivation. This is truer of the alphabet, bound to no particular language,

 

than of other systems. One may thus borrow graphic signs, make them safely emigrate outside

 

of their culture and their language of origin. “But though the Greek alphabet derives from the

 

Phoenoecian, it does not fol-low at all that the Greek language derives from the Phoenoecian”

 

[p. ao].

This movement of analytic abstraction in the circulation of arbitrary signs is quite parallel to

 

that within which money is constituted. Money replaces things by their signs, not only within

 

a society but from one culture to another, or from one economic organization to another. That

 

is why the alphabet is commercial, a trader. It must be understood within the mone

tary

 

moment of economic rationality. The critical description of money is the faithful reflection of

 

the discourse on writing. In both cases an anony

mous supplement is substituted for the thing.

 

Just as the concept retains only the comparable element of diverse things, just as money gives

 

the “common measure” 25 to incommensurable objects in order to constitute them into

 

merchandise, so alphabetic writing transcribes heterogeneous sig

nifieds within a system of

 

arbitrary and common signifiers: the living languages. It thus opens an aggression against the

 

life that it makes circu

late. If “the sign has led to the neglect of the thing signified,” as 

Emile

 

26 

says speaking of money, then the forgetfulness of things is greatest in the usage of those

 

perfectly abstract and arbitrary signs that are money and phonetic writing.

Following the same graphic, the alphabet introduces a supplementary degree of

 

representativity which marks the progress of analytic rationality. This time, the element

 

brought to light is a pure signifier (purely arbi

trary), in itself nonsignifying. This

 

nonsignification is the negative, abstract, and formal aspect of universality or rationality. The

 

value of such a writing

((301))




is therefore ambiguous. There was a natural universality of a sort in the most archaic degree

 

of writing: painting, as much as the alphabet, is not tied to any determined language. Capable

 

of reproducing all sensible being, it is a sort of universal writing. But its liberty with reference

 

to languages is due not to the distance which separates painting from its model but to the

 

imitative proximity which binds them. Under a universal appearance, painting would thus be

 

perfectly empirical, multiple, and changeful like the sensory units that it represents outside of

 

any code. By contrast, the ideal universality of phonetic writing is due to its infinite distance

 

with respect to the sound (the primary signified of that writing which marks it arbitrarily) and

 

to the meaning signified by the spoken word. Between these two poles, universality is lost. I

 

say between these two poles since, as I have con-firmed, pure pictography and pure

 

phonography are two ideas of reason. Ideas of pure presence: in the first case, presence of the

 

represented thing in its perfect imitation, and in the second, the self-presence of speech itself.

 

In both cases, the signifier tends to be effaced in the presence of the signified.

This ambiguity characterizes the evaluation that all metaphysics has imposed upon its own

 

writing since Plato. Rousseau’s text belongs to this history, articulating one of its remarkable

 

epochs. More rational, more exact, more precise, more clear, the writing of the voice

 

corresponds to a more efficient civil order. But in so far as it effaces itself better than another

 

before the possible presence of the voice, it represents it better and permits it to be absent with

 

the smallest loss. Faithful servant of speech, it is pre

ferred to writings used by other societies,

 

but as a slave is preferred to a barbarian, fearing it at the same time as a machine of death.

For its rationality distances it from passion and song, that is to say from the living origin of

 

language. It progresses with the consonant. Correspond-ing to a better organization of social

 

institutions, it also gives the means of more easily doing without the sovereign presence of the

 

assembled people. It tends to restore natural dispersion. Writing naturalizes culture. It is that

 

precultural force which is at work as articulation within culture, working to efface a difference

 

which it has opened. Political rationality—the ra

tionality of fact, and not the rationality whose

 

principle 

The Social Con-tract 

describes—favors writing and dispersion at the same time and

 

in the same movement.

The propagation of writing, the teaching of its rules, the production of its instruments and

 

objects, are considered by Rousseau to be an enterprise of political enslavement. That is what

 

one also reads in 

Tristes Tropiques. 

Certain governments are interested in having languages

 

muzzled, thus ensuring that one no longer speak to the soverign people. The abuse of writing

 

is a political abuse. The latter is rather the “reason” of the former:

((302))

language, perfecting itself in books, is corrupted in discourse. It is clearer when one writes,

 

duller when one speaks, syntax is purified and harmony is lost, French becomes more

 

philosophic and less eloquent day by day, soon it will be good only for reading and all its

 

value will be in libraries.

The reason for this abuse lies, as I have submited elsewhere [in the last chapter of the Essay],

 

in the form that governments have taken and which results in our having nothing to say to

 




others except the least interesting things in the world and things that they care least to

 

understand: sermons, academic discourses. Fragment on Pronunciation (pp. 1249—50)

Political decentralization, dispersion, and decentering of sovereignty calls, paradoxically, for

 

the existence of a capital, a center of usurpation and of substitution. In opposition to the

 

autarchic cities of Antiquity, which were their own centers and conversed in the living voice,

 

the modem capi

tal is always a monopoly of writing. It commands by written laws, decrees,

 

and literature. Such is Paris’s role as Rousseau sees it in the text on 

Pro

nunciation. 

Let us not

 

forget that 

The Social Contract 

judged the exercise of the sovereignty of a people and the

 

existence of a capital incompatible. And as in the case of representatives, if it was impossible

 

not to have recourse to them, it was at least necessary to remedy that evil by changing them

 

often. ‘Which amounts to recharging writing with the living voice: “Nevertheless, if the State

 

cannot be reduced to the right limits, there remains still one resource; this is, to allow no

 

capital, to make the seat of government move from town to town, and to assemble by turn in

 

each the Provincial Estates of the country” 27 (p. 427) [p. 76]. The instance of writ-ing must

 

be effaced to the point where a sovereign people 

must not even write to itself, 

its assemblies

 

must meet spontaneously, without “any formal summons” [p. 75]. Which implies—and that is

 

a writing that Rousseau does not wish to read—that there were “fixed and periodic”

 

assemblies that “can-not be abrogated or prorogued,” and therefore a “marked day 

[jour

 

marqué].” 

That mark had to be made orally since the moment the possi

bility of writing were

 

introduced into the operation, it would insinuate usurpation into the body of society. But is not

 

a mark, wherever it is pro

duced, the possibility of writing?

The Theorem and the Theater

The history of the voice and its writing is comprehended between two mute writings, between

 

two poles of universality relating to each other as the natural and the artificial: the pictogram

 

and algebra. The relationship of natural to artificial or arbitrary is itself subject to the law of

 

“ex

tremes” which “touch one another.” And if Rousseau suspects alphabetic writing without

 

condemning it absolutely, it is because there are worse.

((303))

It is structurally but the next to the last step of that history. Its artifice has a limit. Unbound to

 

any particular language, it yet refers to the 

phone 

or language in general. As phonetic writing,

 

it keeps an essential relation-ship to the presence of a speaking subject 

in general, 

to a

 

transcendental locutor, to the voice as the self-presence of a life which hears itself speak. In

 

that sense, phonetic writing is not absolute evil. It is not the letter of death. Nevertheless, it

 

announces death. To the extent that that writing progresses with consonantic chilling, it allows

 

the anticipation of the’ice, speech degree zero: the disappearance of the vowel, the writing of

 

a- dead language. The consonant, which is easier to write than the vowel, initiates this end of

 

speech in the universal writing, in algebra:

It would be easy to construct a language consisting solely of consonants, which could be

 

written clearly but not spoken. Algebra has something of such a lan

guage. When the

 

orthography of a language is clearer than its pronunciation, this is a sign that it is written more

 




than it is spoken. This may have been true of the scholarly language of the Egyptians; as is the

 

case for us with the dead languages. In those burdened with useless consonants, writing seems

 

to have pre-ceded speech: and who would doubt that such is the case with Polish? 

[Essay],

 

Chap. 7 [p. 28]

The universal characteristic, writing become purely conventional through having broken all

 

links with the spoken language—such then would be ab-solute evil. With the 

Logic of Port-

Royal, 

Locke’s 

Essay, 

Malebranche, and Descartes, Leibniz was one of Rousseau’s primary

 

philosophic readings. 28 He is not cited in the 

Essay 

but in the fragment on 

Pronunciation.

 

With as much suspicion as the “art of Raymond Lully” in 

Emile 

(p. 575) [p. 425].

Languages are made to be spoken, writing serves only as supplement to speech; if there are

 

some languages that are only written, and that one cannot speak, belonging only to the

 

sciences, it would be of no use in civil life. Such is algebra, such was no doubt the universal

 

language that Leibniz looked for. It would probably have been more useful to a Metaphysician

 

than to an Artisan (p. 1249).

The universal writing of science would thus be absolute alienation. The autonomy of the

 

representer becomes absurd: it has attained its limit and broken with all representeds, with all

 

living origin, with all living present. In it supplementarity is accomplished, that is to say

 

emptied. The supple-ment, which is neither simply the signifier nor simply the representer,

 

does not take the place of a signified or a represented, as is prescribed by the concepts of

 

signification or representation or by the syntax of the words “signifier” or “representer.” The

 

supplement comes in the place of a lapse, a nonsignified or a nonrepresented, a nonpresence.

 

There is no present before it, it is not preceding by anything but itself, that is to say by another

((304))

supplement. The supplement is always the supplement of a supplement. One wishes to go

 

back 

from the supplement to the source: 

one must recognize that there is 

a supplement at the

 

source.

Thus it is always already algebraic. In its writing, the visble signifier, has always already

 

begun to seperate itself from speech and to supplant it. The nonphonetic and universal writing

 

of science is also in that sense a 

theorem. 

It is enough to look in order to calculate. As Leibniz

 

said, 

“ad vocem ref erri non est necesse.”

Through that silent and mortal glance the complicities of science and politics are exchanged:

 

more precisely of modem political science. “The letter killeth” 

(Emile, 

p. 226) [p. 159].

Where should one search, in the city, for that lost unity of glance and speech? In what 

space

 

can one again 

listen to himself? 

Can the theater, which unites spectacle and discourse, not take

 

up where the unanimous assembly left off? “For a long time now one speaks in public only

 

through books, and if one says something in person to the public that interests it, it is in the

 

theater” 

(Pronunciation, 

p. 1250).




But the theater itself is shaped and undermined by the profound evil of representation. It is

 

that corruption itself. For the stage is not threatened by anything but itself. Theatrical

 

representation, in the sense of exposition, of production, of that which is placed out there (that

 

which the German 

Darstellung 

translates) is contaminated by supplementary re-presentation.

 

The latter is inscribed in the structure of representation, in the space of the stage. Let us not be

 

mistaken, what Rousseau criticizes in the last analysis is not the content of the spectacle, the

 

sense 

represented 

by it, although that 

too 

he criticizes: it is re-presentation itself. Exactly as

 

within the political order, the menace has the shape of the representative.

In fact, after having evoked the misdeeds of the theater considered in the content of what it

 

stages, in its 

represented, 

the 

Letter to d’Alembert 

incriminates representation and the

 

representer: 

“Beyond these effects of the theatre, which are relative to what is 

performed

 

[representées], 

there are others 

no less necessary 

which relate directly to the 

stage 

and to the

 

persons who perform [representants]; 

and it is to them that the previ

ously mentioned

 

Genevans attribute the taste for luxury, adornment, and dissipation, whose introduction among

 

us they rightly fear.” 29 Immorality, then, attaches, to the very status of the representer

 

(performer). Vice is his natural bent. It is normal that he who has taken up representation as a

 

profession should have a taste for external and artificial signifiers, and for the perverse use of

 

signs. Luxury, fine clothes, and dissipation are not sig

nifiers incidentally coming about here

 

and there, they are the crimes of the signifier or the representer itself.

Double consequence:

((305))

1. There are two sorts of public persons, two men of spectacle: on the one hand the orator or

 

preacher, on the other the actor. The former repre

sents himself, in him the representer and the

 

represented are one. But the actor is bom out of the rift between the representer and the

 

represented. Like the alphabetic signifier, like the letter, the actor himself is not inspired or

 

animated by any particular language. He signifies nothing. He hardly lives, he lends his voice.

 

It is a mouthpiece. Of course the difference be

tween the orator or preacher and the actor

 

presupposes that the former does his duty, says what he has to say. If they do not assume

 

ethical responsibil

ity for their word, they become actors, hardly even actors, for the latter

 

make a duty of saying what they do not think:

The orator and the preacher, it could be said, make use of their persons as does the actor. The

 

difference is, however, very great. When the orator appears in public, it is to speak and not to

 

show himself off; he 

represents only himself: 

he fills only his own proper role, speaks only in

 

his own name, says, or ought to say, only what he thinks; 

the man and the role being the same

 

[being] 

[étant le même être], 

he is 

in his place; 

he is in the situation of any citizen who fulfils

 

the functions of his estate. But an actor on the stage, displaying other sentiments than his own,

 

saying only what he is made to say, 

often representing a chimeri

cal being, 

annihilates himself,

 

as it were, and is lost in his hero. And, in this forgetting of the man, if something remains of

 

him, it is used as the plaything of the spectators (p. 187; italics added) [pp. 80-81].




It is the best possible situation: the actor accepts the role and loves what he incarnates. The

 

situation may be still worse. “What shall I say of those who seem to be afraid of having too

 

much merit as they are and who degrade themselves to the point of playing characters whom

 

they would be quite distressed to resemble?” [p. 

81].

The identity of the representer and the represented may be accom

plished in two ways. The

 

better way: by the effacement of the representer and the personal presence of the represented

 

(the orator, the preacher); or the worse way: it is not illustrated by the actor alone (representer

 

emptied of what he represents) but by a certain society, that of the worldly Parisians who

 

have, in order to find themselves there, alienated themselves in a cer

tain theater, theater of a

 

theater, play representing the comedy of that society. “It is nevertheless solely for these people

 

that theatrical entertain

ments are made. They are represented by fictitious characters in the

 

middle of the theater, and show themselves in real ones on each side; they are at once persons

 

of the drama on the stage, and comedians in the boxes” (La 

Nouvelle Héloise, 

p. 252). * This

 

total alienation of the represented within

((306))

the representer is the negative aspect of the social pact. In both cases, the represented is

 

reappropriated when he is lost without reserve in his repre

sentation. In what terms should the

 

elusive difference which separates the positive from the negative aspect, the authentic social

 

pact from a forever-perverted theater, from a 

theatrical 

society, be defined?

2. The signifier is the death of the festival. The innocence of the public spectacle, the good

 

festival, the dance around the water hole, would open a theater without representation. Or

 

rather a stage without a show: without 

theater, 

with nothing to see. Visibility—a moment ago

 

the theorem, here the theatre—is always that which, separating it from itself, breaches

 

[entame] 

the living voice.

But what is a stage which presents nothing to the sight? It is the place where the spectator,

 

presenting himself as spectacle; will no longer be either seer 

[voyant] 

or voyeur, will efface

 

within himself the difference be

tween the actor and the spectator, the represented and the

 

representer, the object seen and the seeing subject. With that difference, an entire series of

 

oppositions will deconstitute themselves one by one. Presence will be full, not as an object

 

which is 

present 

to be seen, to give itself to intuition as an empirical unit or as an 

eidos

 

holdingitself 

in front of 

or 

up against; 

it will be full as the intimacy of a self-presence, as the

 

consciousness or the sentiment of self-proximity, of self-sameness 

[propriété]. 

That public

 

festival will there-fore have a form analogous to the electoral meetings of a free and legiferant

 

assembled people: the representative differance will be effaced in the self-presence of

 




sovereignty. “The exaltation of the collective festival has the same structure as the general

 

will of 

The Social Contract. 

The description of 

public joy 

gives us the lyrical aspect of the

 

general will: it is the aspect that it assumes in its Sunday best.” 30 The text is well known. It

 

recalls the evocation of the festival in the 

Essay. 

Let us reread it in order to recognize the

 

desire of making 

representation 

disappear, with all- the meanings that converge in that word:

 

delay and delegation, repetition of a present in its sign or its concept, the proposition or

 

opposition of a show, an object to be seen:

What! Ought there to be no entertainments in a republic? On the contrary, there ought to be

 

many. It is in republics that they were born, it is in their bosom that they are seen to flourish

 

with a truly festive air. 

[Letter to d’Alem

bert, 

p. 1251

These innocent spectacles will take place outdoors and they will have nothing “effeminate” or

 

“mercenary” about them. The sign, money, ruse, passivity, and servility will be excluded from

 

them. No one will use anyone, no one will be an object for anyone. There will no longer be,

 

after a cer

tain fashion, anything to see:

((307))

But what then will be the objects of these entertainments? ‘What will be shown in them?

 

Nothing, if you please. With liberty, wherever abundance reigns, well-being also reigns. Plant

 

a stake crowned with flowers in the middle of a square; gather the people together there, and

 

you will have a festival. Do better yet; let the spectators become an entertainment to

 

themselves; make them actors themselves; do it so that each sees and loves himself in the

 

others so that all will be better united. 

Letter to M. d’Alembert, 

pp. 224—25 [p. 126]

‘

We must note that this festival without object is also a festival without sacrifice, without

 

expense, and without play. Above all without masks. 31 It has no outside although it takes

 

place out of doors. It maintains itself in a purely interior relation to itself. “So that each sees

 

and loves himself in the others.” In a certain way, it is confined and sheltered, whereas the

 

hall of the theater, wrenched away from itself by the games and detours of repre

sentation,

 

diverted from itself and torn by differance, multiplies the outside in itself. There are many

 

games [jeux] 

within the public festival but no 

play [jeu] 

at all, if one understands by that

 

singular number the substitution of contents, the exchange of presences and absences, chance

 

and absolute risk. That festival represses the relationship with death; what was not necessarily

 

implied in the description of the enclosed theatre. These analy

ses can turn in both directions.

At any rate, play is so much absent from the festival that the dance is admitted as the initiation

 

into marriage and is contained within the closure of the ball. Such is at least the interpretation

 

to which Rousseau submits, to fix it carefully, the meaning of his text on the festival. One

 

could make him say quite a different thing. And Rousseau’s text must constantly be

 

considered as a complex and many-leveled structure; in it, certain propositions may be read as

 

interpretations of other propositions that we are, up to a certain point and with certain

 

precautions, free to read otherwise. Rousseau says A, then for reasons that we must determine,

 

he interprets A into B. A, which was already an interpretation, is rein

terpreted into B. After

 

taking cognizance of it, we may, without leaving Rousseau’s text, isolate A from its

 




interpretation into B, and discover pos

sibilities and resources there that indeed belong to

 

Rousseau’s text, but were not produced or exploited by him, which, for equally legible

 

motives, he 

preferred to cut short 

by a gesture neither witting nor unwitting. In his description

 

of the festival, for example, there are propositions which could very well have been

 

interpreted in the sense of Antonin Artaud’s 32 theater of cruelty or of the festival and

 

sovereignty of which Georges Bataille has proposed the concepts. But these propositions are

 

interpreted otherwise by Rousseau himself, who transforms play into games and the dance

 

into a ball, expense into presence.

What ball are we speaking of here? To understand that, one must first

((308))

understand the praise of the open air. The open air is undoubtedly Nature and in that respect it

 

must lead Rousseau’s thoughts in a thousand ways, through all the themes of pedagogy,

 

promenade, botany, and so on. But more precisely, the open air is the element of the voice, the

 

liberty of a breath that nothing breaks into pieces. A voice that can make itself heard in the

 

open air is a free voice, a clear voice that the northern principle has not yet muzzled with

 

consonants, not yet broken, articulated, compart

mentalized, and which can reach the

 

interlocutor immediately. The open air is frankness, the absence of evasions, of representative

 

mediations among living spoken words. It is the element of the Greek city, “the great

 

concern” of which was “its liberty.” The north limits the possibilities of the open air: “Your

 

severer climates add to your needs; for half the year your public squares are uninhabitable;

 

the flatness of your languages unfits them for being heard in the open air; you 

sacrifice more

 

for profit than for liberty, and fear slavery less than poverty” 

(The Social Contract, 

p. 431) [p.

 

79; italics added]. Once again the northern influence is pernicious. But a northern man must

 

live like a northerner. To adopt or adapt southern customs in the North is pure folly and worse

 

servitude (ibid.). One must therefore find substitutes in the North or in winter. The winter

 

substitute of the festival is our dance for young brides-to-be. Rousseau recommends the

 

practice: unequivocally and as he himself says, without scruple; and what he says of winter

 

illuminates after a fashion what he might have said of summer.

Winter, a time consecrated to the private association of friends, is less appropri

ate to public

 

festivals. There is, however, one sort concerning which I wish there were not so many

 

scrupulous doubts raised, that is, the balls for young marriageable persons. I have never

 

understood why people are so worried about dancing and the gatherings it occasions, as if

 

there were something worse about dancing than singing, as if these amusements were not both

 

equally an inspira

tion of nature, as if it were a crime for those who are destined to be united to

 

be merry together in a decent recreation. Man and woman were formed for one another. God

 

wants them to fulfill their destiny, and certainly the first and holiest of all the bonds of society

 

is marriage. 

33

One should comment word by word on the long and edifying discourse that follows. A hinge

 

articulates the entire argument: the full daylight of presence avoids the dangerous supplement.

 

One must allow pleasures to “a lively and frolicsome youth” to avoid their “substituting more

 

dangerous ones” and to prevent “private meetings adroitly concerted [from] taking] the place

 




of public gatherings.” “Innocent joy is likely to evaporate in the full light of day; but vice is a

 

friend of shadows” 

(Letter to M. d’Alembert, 

p. 227) [p. 129]. Furthermore, the nudity that

 

presents the body itself is less dangerous than the recourse to sartorial signifiers, to the

 

northern sup-

((309))

plement, to “artful dress”: the latter is not “less dangerous than an absolute nudity the habit of

 

which would soon turn the first effects into indifference and perhaps distaste.” “Is it not

 

known that statues and paintings only offend the eyes when a mixture of clothing renders the

 

nudity obscene? The immediate power of the senses is weak and limited; it is through the

 

intermediary of the imagination that they make their greatest ravages; it is the business of the

 

imagination to irritate the desires” (p. 232) [p. 134]. It will have been noticed that

 

representation—the picture—rather than per

ception, is chosen to illustrate the danger of the

 

supplement whose effi

ciency is the imagination. And it will then be noticed that, in a note

 

inserted into the heart of this praise of marriage, anticipating the errors of posterity, Rousseau

 

makes only one exception to his denials:

It is something amusing for me to imagine the judgments that many will make of my tastes on

 

the basic of my writings. On the basis of this one they will not fail to say: “that man is crazy

 

about dancing”; it bores me to watch dancing; “he cannot bear the drama”; I love the drama

 

passionately; “he has an aversion to women”; on that score I shall be only too easily

 

vindicated (p. 229) [p. 131n].

Thus the North, winter, death, imagination, representation, the irritation of desires—this entire

 

series of supplementary significations—does not desig

nate a natural place or fixed terms:

 

rather a periodicity. Seasons. In the order of time, or rather like time itself, they speak the

 

movement by which the presence of the present separates from itself, supplants itself, replaces

 

itself by absenting itself, produces itself in self-substitution. It is this that the metaphysics of

 

presence as self-proximity wishes to efface by giving a privileged position to a sort of

 

absolute now, the 

life 

of the present, the living present. The coldness of representation not

 

only breaks self-presence but also the originarity of the present as the absolute form of

 

temporality.

This metaphysics of presence constantly reappears and is resumed in Rousseau’s text

 

whenever the fatality of the supplement seems to limit it. It is always necessary to add a

 

supplement of presence to the presence that is concealed. “The great remedy to the miseries of

 

this world” is “absorption into the present moment,” says Rousseau in 

The Solitaries. 

The

 

present is originary, that is to say the determination of origin always has the form of presence.

 

Birth is the birth (of) presence. Before it there is no presence; and from the moment that

 

presence, holding or announcing itself to itself, breaches its plenitude and starts the chain of

 

its history, death’s work has begun. Birth in general is written as Rousseau describes his own:

 

“I cost my mother her life; and my birth was the first of my misfortunes” 

(Con-fessions, 

p. 

7)

 

[p. 

5]. 

Every time that Rousseau tries to recapture an essence (in the form of an origin, a right,

 

an ideal limit), he always leads us back to a point of full presence. He is less interested in the

 

present, in the being-




((310))

present, than in the presence of the present, in its essence as it appears to itself and is retained

 

in itself. Essence is presence. As life, that is as self-presence, it is birth. And just as the present

 

goes out of itself only to return to itself, a rebirth is possible which, furthermore, is the only

 

thing that permits all the repetitions of origin. Rousseau’s discourse and questions are possible

 

only in the anticipation of a rebirth or a reactivation of the origin. Rebirth, resurrection, or

 

reawakening always appropriate to them-selves, in their fugitive immediacy, the plenitude of

 

presence returning to itself.

That return to the presence of the origin is produced after each catastro

phe, at least in so far as

 

it 

re-verses 

the order of life without destroying it. After a divine finger had 

turned 

the order of

 

the world 

over [renversé] 

by inclining the axis of the globe on the axis of the universe and

 

had thus willed that “men [be] sociable,” the festival around the water hole was possible and

 

pleasure was immediately present to desire. After a “great Danish dog” had 

knocked 

Jean-

Jacques 

over [renversé] 

in the second 

Promenade; 

when after “the fall” which had

 

precipitated 

him (“my head was thrown down lower than my feet”) it was first necesasry to

 

recount 

to him the “accident” that he had not been able to experience; when he explains to us

 

what happened at the moment when, he says twice, “I came to myself,” “I came back to

 

consciousness,”—it is indeed awakening as re-awakening to pure presence that he describes,

 

always according to the same model: not anticipation, not memory, not comparison, not

 

distinc

tion, not articulation, not situation. Imagination, memory, and signs are effaced. All

 

landmarks on the physical or psychical landscape are natural.

The state in which I found myself in that instant was too singular not to make a description of

 

it here.

The night was coming on. I perceived the sky, some stars, and a little grass. This first

 

sensation was a delicious moment. I did not feel anything except through them. I was born in

 

that instant to life, and it seemed to me that I filled with my light existence all the objects

 

which I perceived. Entirely given up to the present moment, I did not remember anything; I

 

had no distinct notion 

of 

my individuality, not the least idea of what had happened to me; I did

 

not know who I was nor where I was; I felt neither evil nor fear, nor trouble.

And, as around the water hole, and on the Isle of St. Pierre, the enjoy-ment 

[jouissance] 

of

 

pure presence is that of a certain flow. Presence being bom. Origin of life, blood’s

 

resemblance to water. Rousseau continues:

I saw my blood flowing as I might have looked at a brooklet, without dreaming even that this

 

blood in any way belonged to me. I felt in the whole of my being a ravishing calm, to which,

 

each time that I think of it, I find nothing com

parable in the whole action of known pleasures

 

(p. 1oo5) [p. 49].




((311))

Are there other or more archetypal pleasures? This pleasure, which is the only pleasure, is at

 

the same time properly 

unimaginable. 

Such is the para

dox of the imagination: it alone arouses

 

or irritates desire but also it alone, and for the same reason, in the same movement, extends

 

beyond or divides presence. Rousseau would like to separate the awakening to presence from

 

the operation of imagination; he always presses on toward that impossible limit. For the

 

awakening of presence projects or rejects us immediately outside of presence where we are

 

“led . . . by that living interest, foresightful and all-providing 

[prévoyant et pourvoyant],

 

which . . . always throws us far from the present, and which does not exist for natural man”

 

(Dia

logues) 3

4 Function of representation, imagination is also the temporalizing function, the

 

excess of the present and the economy of what exceeds presence. There is no unique and full

 

present (but is there presence then?) except in the imagination’s sleep: “The sleeping

 

imagination does not know at all how to extend its being into two different times” 

(Emile, 

p.

 

69). 

When it appears, signs, fiduciary values [legal tender and trusts], and letters emerge, and

 

they are worse than death.

How many merchants lament in Paris over some misfortune in India! . . . There is a healthy,

 

cheerful, strong, and vigorous man; it does me good to see him. ... A letter comes by post. . . .

 

[He] falls into a swoon. When he comes to himself he weeps, laments, and groans, he tears his

 

hair, and his shrieks re-echo through the air. You would say he was in convulsions. Fool, what

 

harm has this bit of paper done you? What limb has it torn away? . . . We no longer live in our

 

own place, we live outside it. ‘What does it profit me to live in such fear of death, when all

 

that makes life worth living remains? 

(Emile, 

pp. 

67–68) 

[P. 

47]

Rousseau himself articulates this chain of significations (essence, origin, presence, birth,

 

rebirth) on the classical metaphysics of the entity as 

energy, 

encompassing the relationships

 

between being and time in terms of the now as being in action 

(energeia) :

Delivered from the disquietude of hope, and 

sure of thus gradually losing that of desire,

 

seeing that the past was no longer anything to me, I undertook to put myself completely in the

 

situation of a man who begins to live. I told myself that in fact 

we were always beginning,

 

and that there was no other link in our existence but a succession of present moments of

 

which the first is always that which is in action. 

We are bom and die every moment of our life.

It follows—but it is 

a liaison 

that Rousseau works very hard to elide—that the very essence of

 

presence, if it must always be repeated within an-other presence, opens originarily, within

 

presence itself, the structure of rep

resentation. And if essence is presence, there is no essence

 

of presence nor presence of essence. There is a play of representation and eliding that liai-

((312))

son or that consequence, Rousseau places play out of play: he eludes, which is another way of

 

playing, or rather, as the dictionaries say, of playing (with). What is thus eluded is the fact that

 

representation does not suddenly en

croach upon presence; it inhabits it as the very condition

 

of its experience, of desire, and of enjoyment 

[jouissance]. 

The intertior doubling of presence,

 




its halving, makes it appear as such, that is to say, concealing enjoyment in frustration, makes

 

it disappear as such. Placing representation outside, which means placing the outside outside,

 

Rousseau would like to make of the supplement of presence a pure and simple addition, a

 

contingence: thus wishing to elude what, in the interior of presence, calls forth the substitute,

 

and is constituted only in that appeal, and in its trace.

Thence the letter. Writing is the evil of representative repetition, the double that opens desire

 

and contemplates and binds 

[re-garde] 

enjoyment. Literary writing, the traces of the

 

Confessions, 

speak that doubling of pres

ence. Rousseau condemns the evil of writing and

 

looks for a haven within writing. It repeats enjoyment symbolically. And just as enjoyment

 

has never been present except in a certain repetition, so writing, recalling enjoyment, gives it

 

as well. Rousseau eludes its admission but not the pleasure. We re-call those texts (“Saying to

 

myself I have rejoiced, I rejoice again....” “I rejoice again in a pleasure that no longer is.” . . .

 

“Incessantly occupied with the thought of my past happiness, I recall it, so to speak, chew the

 

cud of it to such an extent that, when I desire it, I am able to enjoy it over again”) [p. 607].

 

Writing 

represents 

(in every sense of the word) enjoyment. It plays enjoyment, renders it

 

present and absent. It is play. And it is be-cause it is also the good fortune of enjoyment

 

repeated that Rousseau practices it while condemning it: “I shall set down in writing those

 

[’de

lightful contemplations’] which may still come to me: each time that I reread them will

 

give me new pleasure” 

(Reveries, p. 999) 

[p. 

38].

This entire digression was necessary in order to mark well that, unless some extrinsic desire is

 

invested in it, Leibniz’s universal characteristic represents the very death of enjoyment. It

 

leads the representer to the limit of its excess. Phonetic writing, however abstract and

 

arbitrary, retained some relationship with the presence of the represented voice, to its pos

sible

 

presence in general and therefore to that of a certain passion. A writing that breaks with the

 

phonè 

radically is perhaps the most rational and effec

tive of scientific machines; it no longer

 

responds to any desire or rather 

it signifies its death to desire. 

It was what already operated

 

within speech as writing and machine. It is the representer in its pure state, without the

 

represented, or without the order of the represented naturally linked to it. That is why this

 

pure conventionality ceases, being pure, to be of any use within “civil life,” which always

 

mingles nature and convention. The perfection of convention here touches its opposite

 

extreme, it is death and the perfect alienation of the instrument of civil order. The telos of the

((313))

alienation of writing has in Rousseau’s eyes the form of scientific or technical writing,

 

wherever it can act, that is to say even outside of the areas reserved for “science” or

 

“technology.” It is not by chance that in mythology, the Egyptian in particular, the god of

 

sciences and technologies is also the god of writing; and that it is he (Thoth, Theuth, Teuthus

 

or his Greek homologue Hermes, god of the ruse, of trade, and of thieves) whom Rousseau

 

incriminates in the 

Discourse on the Arts and Sciences. 

(Plato had already denounced his

 

invention of writing at the end of the 

Phaedrus.) :

An ancient tradition passed out of Egypt into Greece, that some god, who was an enemy to the

 

repose of mankind, was the inventor of the sciences.* ... In fact, whether we turn to the annals

 




of the world, or supplement with philo

sophical investigations the uncertain chronicles of

 

history, we shall not find for human knowledge an origin answering to the idea we are pleased

 

to entertain of it at present. . . . Their evil origin is indeed, but too plainly reproduced in their

 

objects. [Cole, op. cit., p. 131.]

•

It is easy to see the allegory in the fable of Prometheus: and it does not appear that the

 

Greeks, who chained him to the Caucasus, had a better opinion of him than the Egyptians had

 

of their god Teuthus (p. 12) .

The Supplement of (at) the Origin

In the last pages of the chapter “On Script,” the critique, the appreciative presentation, and the

 

history of writing, 

declares 

the absolute exteriority of writing but 

describes 

the interiority of

 

the principle of writing to language. The sickness of the outside (which comes from the

 

outside but also draws outside, thus equally, or inversely, the sickness of the homeland, a

 

home-sickness, so to speak) is in the heart of the living word, as its principle of effacement

 

and its relationship to its own death. In other words, it does not suffice to show, it is in fact not

 

a question of showing, the interiority of what Rousseau would have believed exterior; rather

 

to speculate upon the power of exteriority as constitutive of interiority: of speech, of signified

 

meaning, of the present as such; in the sense in which I said, a moment ago, that the

 

representative mortal doubling-halving constituted the living present, without adding itself to

 

presence; or rather constituted it, para

doxically, by being added to it. The question is of an

 

originary supplement, if this absurd expression may be risked, totally unacceptable as it is

 

within classical logic. Rather the supplement of origin: which supplements the failing origin

 

and which is yet not derived; this supplement is, as one says of a spare part 

[une pièce], 

of the

 

original make 

[d’origine] 

[or a document, establishing the origin.]

((314))

Thus one takes into account that the absolute 

alterity 

of writing might nevertheless affect

 

living speech, from the outside, within its inside: 

alter it 

[for the worse]. Even as it has an

 

independent history, as we have seen, and in spite of the inequalities of development, the play

 

of structural cor-relations, writing marks the history of speech. Although it is born out of

 

“needs of a different kind” and “according to circumstances entirely inde

pendent of the

 

duration of the people,” although these needs might “never have occurred,” the irruption of

 

this absolute contingency determined the interior of an essential history and affected the

 

interior unity of a life, 

literally infected 

it. It is the strange essence of the supplement not to

 

have essentiality: it may always not have taken place. Moreover, literally, it has never taken

 

place: it is never present, here and now. If it were, it would not be what it is, a supplement,

 

taking and keeping the place of the other. What alters for the worse the living nerve of

 

language (“Writing, which would seem to crystallize language, is precisely what alters it; it

 

changes not the words but the spirit of language . . .”) has therefore above all not taken place.

 

Less than nothing and yet, to judge by its effects, much more than nothing. The supplement is

 

neither a presence nor an ab

sence. No ontology can think its operation.




As Saussure will do, so does Rousseau wish at once to maintain the exteriority of the system

 

of writing and the maleficent efficiency with which one singles out its symptoms on the body

 

of the language. But am I saying anything else? Yes, in as much as I show the interiority of

 

exteriority, which amounts to annulling the ethical qualification and to thinking of writing

 

beyond good and evil; yes above all, in as much as we designate the impossibility of

 

formulating the movement of supplementarity within the classical logos, within the logic of

 

identity, within ontology, within the opposition of presence and absence, positive and

 

negative, and even within dialectics, if at least one determines it, as spiritualistic or

 

materialistic meta-physics has always done, within the horizon of presence and reappropria

-

tion. Of course the 

designation 

of that impossibility escapes the language of metaphysics only

 

by a hairsbreadth. For the rest, it must borrow its re-sources from the logic it deconstructs.

 

And by doing so, find its very foot-hold there.

One can no longer see disease in substitution when one sees that the substitute is substituted

 

for a substitute. Is that not what the 

Essay de-scribes? 

“[Writing substitutes] exactitude for

 

expressiveness.” Expression is the expression of affect, of the passion at the origin of

 

language, of a speech that was first substituted for song, marked by 

tone 

and 

force. 

Tone and

 

force signify the 

present voice: 

they are anterior to the concept, they are singular, they are,

 

moreover, attached to vowels, the vocalic and not the consonantic element of language. The

 

force of expression amounts only to vocalic sounds, when the subject is there in person to

 

utter his

((315))

passion. When the subject is no longer there, force, intonation, and accent are lost in the

 

concept. Then one writes, one “substitutes” in vain “ac

centual marks” for “accent,” one bows

 

to the generality of the law: “In writing, one is forced to use all the words according to their

 

conventional meaning. But in speaking, one varies the meanings by varying one’s tone of

 

voice, determining them as one pleases. Being less constrained to clarity, one can be more

 

forceful. And it is not possible for a language that is writ-ten to retain its vitality as long as

 

one that is only spoken” [Essay, pp. 21-22].

Thus writing is always atonal. The place of the subject is there taken by another, it is

 

concealed. The spoken sentence, which is valuable only once and remains “proper only to the

 

place where it is,” loses its place and its proper meaning as soon as it is written down. “The

 

means used to overcome 

[suppléer] 

this weakness tend to stretch out written language and

 

make it elaborately prolix; and many books written in discourse will enervate speech itself.”

But if Rousseau could say that “words [voix], not sounds 

[sons], 

are writ-ten,” it is because

 

words are distinguished from sounds exactly by what permits writing—consonants and

 

articulation. The latter replace only them-selves. Articulation, which replaces accent, is the

 

origin of languages. Alter-ing [for the worse] through writing is an originary exteriority. It is

 

the origin of language. Rousseau describes it without declaring it. Clandestinely.

A speech without consonantic principle, what for Rousseau would be a speech sheltered from

 

all writing, would not be speech; 

35

 it would hold itself at the fictive limit of the inarticulate

 




and purely natural cry. Conversely, a speech of pure consonants and pure articulation would

 

become pure writ-ing, algebra, or dead language. The death of speech is therefore the horizon

 

and origin of language. But an origin and a horizon which do not hold themselves at its

 

exterior borders. As always, death, which is neither a present to come nor a present past,

 

shapes the interior of speech, as its trace, its reserve, its interior and exterior differance: as its

 

supplement.

But Rousseau could not think this writing, that takes place 

before 

and 

within 

speech. To the

 

extent that he belonged to the metaphysics of pres

ence, he 

dreamed 

of the simple exteriority

 

of death to life, evil to good, representation to presence, signifier to signified, representer to

 

represented, mask to face, writing to speech. But all such oppositions are irreducibly rooted in

 

that metaphysics. Using them, one can only operate by reversals, that is to say by

 

confirmations. The supplement is none of these terms. It is especially not more a signifier than

 

a signified, a representer than a presence, a writing than a speech. None of the terms of this

 

series can, being com

prehended within it, dominate the economy of differance or supplemen

-

tarity. Rousseau’s 

dream 

consisted of making the supplement enter meta-physics by force.

((310))

But what does that mean? The opposition of dream to wakefulness, is not that a representation

 

of metaphysics as well? And what should dream or writing be if, as we know now, one may

 

dream while writing? And if the scene of dream is always a scene of writing? At the bottom of

 

a page of 

Emile, 

after having once more cautioned us against books, writing, signs (“What is

 

the use of inscribing on their brains a list of symbols which mean nothing for them?”), after

 

having opposed the “tracing” of these artificial signs to the “indelible characters” of the Book

 

of Nature, Rous-seau adds a note: “... the dreams of a bad night are given to us as phi

losophy.

 

You will say I too am a dreamer; I admit it, but I do what others fail to do, I give my dreams

 

as dreams, and leave the reader to discover whether there is anything in them which may

 

prove useful to those who are awake” [p. 76].

13.Because it overlooks the invisible erasure, the usual superficial criticism of Derrida goes as

 

follows: he says he is questioning the value of “truth” and “logic,” yet he uses logic to

 

demonstrate the truth of his own arguments! (A characteristic example would be Lionel Abel,

 

“Jacques Derrida : His 

‘Difference’ 

with Metaphysics,” 

Salmagundi 

25 [Winter, 1974] : 3-21.)

 

The point is, of course, that the predicament of having to use resources of the heritage that one

 

questions is the 

overt 

concern of Derrida’s work, and as such is prepared for, as I shall show,

 

by the fundamental questionings of Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger.

18.Here Derrida

’s often implicit Freudianism surfaces. The history of metaphysics, like a

 

dream-neurosis-psychosis, is constituted by distortion. Metaphor and metonymy are rhetorical

 

translations of “condensation” and “displacement,” two major techniques, as Freud pointed

 

out, of dream-distortion (see also page xlvi) .

19.Marx is conspicuous here by his absence. Derrida’s detachment from Marxist texts is often

 

a ground for dissatisfaction among younger French and American intel

lectuals—some of the

 

Tel Quel group, Felix Guattari, Fredric Jameson. I believe there is a simple enough

 

explanation for this detachment. Derrida’s method of deconstructive reading is laboriously

 

textual. As a young philosopher he has coped with specifically “philosophical” texts. Catching

 

the Freudian avant-garde of the fifties and sixties, he has coped, and is coping, with the texts

 

of Freud. His interest now, for reasons I discuss on page lxxii, is going toward “literary” texts.

 

In general, the literature of Marxism is so thoroughly schematized that for him to direct the

 

same painstaking attention to the texts of Marx and Marxism will require a good stretch of

 

time. In answer to a question of Jean-Louis Houdebine, Derrida presents a long and

 

interesting answer which, for my purposes, can be summed up as follows: Marx, and his

 

intertextuality with Hegel, Engels, Lenin, Mao, et alia, are still to be submitted to the protocol

 

of reading. See Pos F 82 f., Pos E II 33 f. The distinctions between super- and infrastructures

 

must be reexamined. The textuality of “economic” structures (in a narrow sense) must be

 




opened up to a more general concept of economy. . . . A remote prospectus may be glimpsed

45.Of a good many examples, I shall cite one: “The ‘lacunae’ to which you alluded, and do

 

me the justice of believing this, are explicitly calculated to mark the loci of a theoretical

 

elaboration . . .” (Pos F 

85, Pos 

E II 33), An example of the defense of “my master’s mastery”

 

is to be found even in Paul de Man’s brilliant essay “The Rhet

oric of Blindness: Jacques

 

Derrida’s Reading of Rousseau” 

(Blindness and Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of

 

Contemporary Criticism 

[New York, 19711): “Rousseau was not deluded and said what he

 

meant to say. . . . Instead of having Rousseau deconstruct his critics, we have Derrida

 

deconstructing a pseudo-Rousseau by means of insights that could have been gained from the

 

‘real’ Rousseau” (pp. 135, 139—40). Yet, as we read Derrida’s own pages on Lévi-Strauss and

 

Rousseau (part 2, chapter 

1, Of Grammatology), 

we sense the same claim being made for

 

Rousseau over Lévi-Strauss: both have given writing short shrift, yet Rousseau’s 

text, 

if not

 

Rousseau, had 

known 

that simply to do so would have been merely symptomatic. The value of

 

mastery, of knowledge, of control, even of having got there first, persists, however vestigially.

 

The “subject” of knowledge then becomes the text. “[The critic’s] use may be no more than to

 

identify an act of deconstruction which has always already, in each case differently, been

 

performed by the text on itself” (J. Hillis Miller, “Deconstructing the Deconstructers,”

 

Diacritics V, ii 

[Summer 19751: 31). This value-in-mastery too is perhaps a “metaphysical”

 

axiom that criticism, at the limit, cannot avoid. For those who are “aware” that this battle

 

cannot be won, there is some measure of comfort in being able to recognize that a 

text, 

even

 

when assigned control, is never sovereign, always ridden by the absence of the subject,

 

always offering a “lack” that the reader must fill, as well as the materials with which to begin

 

to fill it.

It is a common error to

 

equate the phenomenological reduction, “putting out of play,” and the sous 

rature, 

“putting

 

under erasure,” (see, e.g., Fredric Jameson, 

The Prison-House of Language: A Critical

 

Account of Structuralism and Russian Formalism 

[Princeton, 1972], p. 216). The distinction

 

is simple: The gesture of bracketing implies “not this but that,” preserving a bipolarity as well

 

as a hierarchy of empirical impurity and phenomenological purity; the gesture of sous 

rature

 

implies “both this 

and 

that” as well as “neither this nor that” undoing the opposition and the

 

hierarchy between the legible and the erased.

sous rature 

that François Wahl must treat very

 

lightly as a precaution almost automatically taken for granted within all responsible

 

structuralist practice. The discussion is, in general, not unsympa

thetic to Derrida. In the long

 

run, however, it is not touched by Derrida, whose version of structuralism is put “in its place”

 

as a “contamination of the properly structural ges-ture by the ontological, psychological, and

 

transcendental determinations of phenom

enology” (p. 419). Derrida’s reactions to

 

formulations such as these would be a varia

tion on his response to Elisabeth Roudinesco.

68.Barthes, 

Essais critiques, 

p. 218;

69.Ibid., p. 218. In 

Révolution du langage poétique 

(Paris, 1974), Julia Kristeva attempts to

 

neutralize signification and go beyond it into a study of the flexible and contingent

 

positioning of subject and object that we come to call “signification.” In “Sémiotique et

 

symbolique,” the opening section, she would appropriate into structural-ism “the functioning

 

of writing, of the trace, and the grammè that Jacques Derrida has introduced in his critique of

 

phenomenology” (p. 40). When she writes “my concern is therefore not the operating and

 

producing consciousness, but rather the producible con

sciousness” (p. 35 n.), we might think

 

wé hear an echo of Derrida’s “there is no consti

tuting subjectivity” (VP 94, SP 85 n.). But

 

Derrida’s next sentence is: “The very concept of constitution itself must be deconstructed.”

 

And Kristeva, as is evident from the quota

tion above, does not deconstruct or undo the

 

concept of “production,” but rather works within it to say of consciousness—not producing

 

but producible. Aware of the impor

tance of the ground of precomprehended questions, she

 

proposes the thought of the 

chora 

(a Platonic term), designating “a non-expressive totality

 

constituted by . . . drives 

[pulsions] 

and their 

stases 

into a motility as full of movement as it is

 

regulated” (p. 23). The thought of the 

chora, 

a play of the movement and rest of forces, “. . . a

 

delaying as well as one of the possible realizations of the death instinct” (p. 27 n.), “not a

 

transcendental signifier but that which opens signification” (p. 46), does indeed seem




((322))

close to Derrida’s vocabulary. But in fact that thought rests on a set of hierarchized

 

oppositions, is defined always as anterior rather than posterior, pre- rather than post-verbal,

 

pre- rather than postfigurative. It is an ambitious and valuable book, but it does not articulate

 

or perform the “sous rature.” It is not surprising, then, that Kristeva uses her long-standing

 

dyad—the 

génotexte 

and the 

phénotexte—when 

she reads individual poems, reverting to the

 

recognizable scientistic structuralist idiom, closing the book with a confidently

 

compartmentalized “Synoptic Table” arranged under “Lautréamont,” “Mallarmé,” “Political

 

Events and the Social Situation,” “Scientific Events-Discoveries,” and “French Colonialist

 

Expansion”—material for those general laws that differance would not countenance.

In “La dissémination” (Dis pp.

Derrida pre

sents the structure of the square with an

 

open (yet presupposed) fourth side—Ryan relates this to the forever active triangularity of the

 

oedipal position, which intervenes to resolve the unfulfilled narcissistic desire for self-

enclosure (review forthcoming, in 

Diacritics, 

of Mehlman’s book.) For a somewhat restricted

 

yet interesting discussion of Derrida’s tetrapolarity (logic of the open square, rather than the

 

Hegelian triplicity or circularity, and rather than the longed-for narcissistic self-enclosed

 

dyad) see Robert Greer Cohn, “Nodes,” I,

Preface

1. It may be read as an essay published in the review 

Critique 

(December 1965—January

 

1966) . 

Three important publications provided me the opportunity: Madeleine V.-David, 

Le

 

débat sur les écritures et l’hieroglyphe aux xvii° et xviii° siècles 

(1965) 

(DE) ; 

André Leroi-

Gourhan, 

Le geste et la parole 

(1965) (GP) ; 

L’écriture et la psychologie des peuples

 

(Proceedings of a Colloquium, 1963) 

(EP) .

Exergue

1.Cf. for example, the notions of «

 

secondary elaboration

 

» or «

 

symbolism of second

 

intention

 

» in Edmond Ortigues, 

Le discours et le symbole 

(Aubier, 1962) pp. 62 and 171.

 

“Mathematical symbolism is a convention of writing, a scriptural symbolism. It is only by an

 

abuse of vocabulary or by analogy that one speaks of a ‘mathematical language.’ Algorithm is

 

actually a ‘characteristics,’ it is composed of written characters. It does not speak, except

 




through the intermediary of a language which furnishes not only the phonetic expression of

 

the characters, but also the formulation of axioms permitting the determination of the value of

 

these characters. It is true that at a pinch one could decipher unknown characters, but that

 

always supposes an acquired knowledge, a thought already formed by the usage of speech.

 

Therefore, in all hypothesis, mathematical symbol-ism is the fruit of a secondary elaboration,

 

supposing preliminarily the usage of discourse and the possibility of conceiving explicit

 

conventions. It is nevertheless true that mathematical algorithm will express the formal laws

 

of symbolization, of syntactic struc

tures, independent of particular means of expression.” On

 

these problems, cf. also Gilles Gaston Granger, 

Pensée formelle et sciences de l’homme

 

(Paris, 196o), pp. 38 f. and particularly pp. 43 and 50 f. (on the “Reversal of Relationships

 

between the Spoken Language and Writing”) .

2.All works on the history of writing devote space to the problem of the introduc

tion of

 

phonetic writing in the cultures that did not practice it previously. 

Cf. e.g., 

EP, 

pp. 44 f. or «

 

La

 

reforme de l’écriture chinoise,

 

» 

Linguistique, Recherches internationales d la lumière du

 

marxisme 7 

(May—June 1958).

3.Here I do not merely mean those 

“theological prejudices” which, at an identifiable time and

 

place, inflected or repressed the theory of the written sign in the seventeenth and eighteenth

 

centuries. I shall speak of them later in connection with Madeleine V.-David’s book. These

 

prejudices are nothing but the most clearsighted and best cir

cumscribed, historically

 

determined manifestation of a constitutive and permanent presupposition essential to the

 

history of the West, therefore to metaphysics in its entirety, even when it professes to be

 

atheist.

4.

Grammatology: 

“A treatise upon Letters, upon the alphabet, syllabation, reading, and

 

writing,” Littré. To my knowledge and in our time, this word has only been used by I. J. Gelb

 

to designate the project of a modern science in 

A Study of Writing: The Foundations of

 

Grammatology 

[Chicago], 1952 (the subtitle disappears in the 1963 edi

tion). In spite of a

 

concern for systematic or simplified classification, and in spite of the controversial hypotheses

 

on the monogenesis or polygenesis of scripts, this book follows the classical model of

 

histories of writing.

Part I: Chapter 1

1. To speak of a primary writing here does not amount to affirming a chronological priority of

 

fact. That debate is well-known; is writing, as affirmed, for example, by

((324))

Metchaninov and Marr, then Loukotka, “anterior to phonetic language?” (A conclusion

 

assumed by the first edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, later contradicted by Stalin. 

On

 

this debate, cf. V. Istrine, «

 

Langue et écriture,

 

» 

Linguistique, 

op. cit., pp. 35, 6o. 

This debate

 

also forms around the theses advanced by P. van Ginneken. 

On the discussion of these

 




propositions, cf. James Février, 

Histoire de l’écriture 

[Payot, 1948—59], pp. 5 f.) 

. I shall try

 

to show below why the terms and premises of such a debate are suspicious.

2.I shall deal with this problem more directly in 

La voix et le phénomène 

(Paris, 1967)

 

[Speech and Phenomena, op. cit.].

3.Wiener, for example, while abandoning “semantics,” and the opposition, judged by him as

 

too crude and too general, between animate and inanimate etc., nevertheless continues to use

 

expressions like “organs of sense,” “motor organs,” etc. to qualify the parts of the machine.

4.Cf., e.g., 

EP, 

pp. 126, 148, 355, etc. 

From another point of view, cf. Roman Jakobson,

 

Essais de linguistique générale 

(tr. fr. 

[Nicolas Ruwet, Paris, 1963], p. 116) [Jakobson and

 

Morris Halle, 

Fundamentals of Language 

(the Hague, 1956), p. 16].

5.This is shown by Pierre Aubenque 

(Le problème de l’être chez Aristotle 

[Paris, 1966], pp.

 

106 f.) 

. In the course of a provocative analysis, to which I am here indebted, Aubenque

 

remarks: “In other texts, to be sure, Aristotle designates as symbol the rela

tionship between

 

language and things: ‘It is not possible to bring the things themselves to the discussion, but,

 

instead of things, we can use their names as symbols.’ The intermediary constituted by the

 

mental experience is here suppressed or at least neglected, but this suppression is legitimate,

 

since, mental experiences behaving like things, things can be substitued for them immediately.

 

On the other hand, one cannot by any means substitute names for things” (pp. 107—08) .

Essais de linguistique générale, 

tr. fr., p. 162 [”The Phonemic and

 

Grammatical Aspects of Language in their Interrelations,” 

Proceedings of the Sixth

 

International Congress of Linguistics

tion of

 

the concept of the sign, and on the originality of Saussure’s contribution within this

 

continuity, cf. Ortigues, op. cit., pp. 54 f.

7.Cited by Emmanuel Levinas, in 

Difficile liberté 

[Paris, 1963], p. 44.

8.I attempt to develop this theme elsewhere 

(Speech and Phenomena).

9.This does not, by simple inversion, mean that the signifier is fundamental or primary. The

 

“primacy” or “priority” of the signifier would be an expression untenable and absurd to

 

formulate illogically within the very logic that it would legitimately destroy. The signifier will

 

never by rights precede the signified, in which case it would no longer be a signifier and the

 

“signifying” signifier would no longer have a possible signified. The thought that is

 

announced in this impossible formula without being successfully con

tained therein should

 

therefore be stated in another way; it will clearly be impossible to do so without putting the

 

very idea of the sign into suspicion, the “sign-of” which will always remain attached to what

 

is here put in question. At the limit therefore, that thought would destroy the entire

 

conceptuality organized around the concept of the sign (signifier and signified, expression and

 

content, and so on) .

“All

 

this points in the direction of what we encountered when we characterized the Greek

 

experience and interpretation of being. If we retain the usual interpretation of being, the word

 

‘being’ takes its meaning from the unity and determinateness of the horizon which guided our

 

understanding. In short: we understand the verbal substantive

((325))

‘

Sein’ through the infinitive, which in turn is related to the ‘is’ and its diversity that we have

 

described. The definite and particular verb form ‘is,’ the 

third person singular of the present

 

indicative, 

has here a pre-eminent rank. We understand ‘being’ not in regard to the ‘thou art,’

 

‘you are,’ ‘I am,’ or ‘they would be,’ though all of these, just as much as ‘is,’ represent verbal

 

inflections of ‘to be.’ . . . And involuntarily, almost as though nothing else were possible, we

 

explain the infinitive ‘to be’ to ourselves through the ‘is.’

“

Accordingly, ‘being’ has the meaning indicated above, recalling the Greek view of the

 

essence of being, hence a detenninateness which has not just dropped on us acci

dentally from

 

somewhere but has dominated our historical being-there since antiquity. At one stroke our

 

search for the definition of the meaning of the word ‘being’ becomes explicitly what it is,

 

namely a reflection on the source of our hidden history.” I should, of course, cite the entire

 

analysis that concludes with these words.

51, 1965, [p. 54]. 

[Parallel English, French, and Spanish editions of this journal are

 

published simultaneously. My references are to the English 

Diogenes.] 

André Martinet

 

alludes to the “courage” which would formerly have been “needed” to “foresee that the term

 

‘word’ itself might have to be put aside if . . . researches showed that this term could not be

 

given a universally applicable definition” (p. 39) [p. 39]. “Semiology, as revealed by recent

 

studies, has no need of the word” (p. 40) [p. 391. “Grammarians and linguists have long

 

known that the analysis of utterances can be pursued beyond the word without going into

 

phonetics, that is, ending with segments of speech, such as syllables or phonemes, which have

 




nothing to do with meaning” (p. 41) [p. 40]. “We are touching here on what renders the notion

 

of the word so suspect to all true linguists. They cannot accept traditional writing without

 

verifying first whether it reproduces faithfully the true structure of the language which it is

 

supposed to record” (p. 48) [p. 48]. In conclusion Martinet proposes the replacement “in

 

linguistic prac

tice” of the notion of word by that of “syntagm,” any “group of several minimal

 

signs” that will be called “monemes.”

2.Let us extend our quotation to bring out the tone and the affect of these theo

retical

 

propositions. Saussure 

puts the blame on 

writing: “Another result is that the less writing

 

represents what it is supposed to represent, the stronger the tendency to use it as a basis

 

becomes. Grammarians never fail to draw attention to the written form. Psy

chologically, the

 

tendency is easily explained, but its consequences are annoying. Free use of the words

 

‘pronounce’ and ‘pronunciation’ sanctions the abuse and reverses the real, legitimate

 

relationship between writing and language. Whoever says that a certain letter must be

 

pronounced a certain way is mistaking the written image of a sound for the sound itself. For

 

French oi to be pronounced 

wa, 

this spelling would have to exist independently; actually 

wa

 

is 

written oi.” Instead of meditating upon this strange propo

sition, the 

possibility 

of such a

 

text (“actually wa is written oi”), Saussure argues: “To attribute the oddity to an exceptional

 

pronunciation of o and i is also misleading, for this implies that language depends on its

 

written form and that certain liberties may be taken in writing, as if the graphic symbols were

 

the norm” (p. 52) [p. 30].

3.Manuscript included in the

5.Rousseau is seemingly more cautious in the fragment on 

Pronunciation: 

“Thought is

 

analyzed by speech, speech by writing; speech represents thought by conventional signs, and

 

writing represents speech in the same way; thus the art of writing is nothing but a mediated

 

representation of thought, at 

least in the vocalic languages, the only ones that we use” 

(p.

 

1249; italics added). Only seemingly, for even if, unlike Saussure, Rousseau here forbids

 

himself to speak 

in general 

of the entire system, the notions of mediacy and of “vocalic

 

languages” leave the enigma intact. I shall be obliged to return to this.

[tr. Nicolas Ruwet (Paris, 1963)], p. 103) that the

 

phonologistic strand of the Saussurian project seems to be most systematically and most

 

rigorously defended, notably against Hjelmslev’s “algebraic” point of view.

8.Page ‘or. Beyond the scruples formulated by Saussure himself, an entire system of

 

intralinguistic criticism can be opposed to the thesis of the “arbitrariness of the sign.”

16.”The conceptual side of value is made up solely of relations and differences with respect to

 

the other terms of language, and the same can be said of its material side. The important thing

 

in the word is not the sound alone but the phonic differences that make it possible to

 

distinguish this word from all others, for differences carry signification... . A segment of

 

language can never in the final analysis be based on anything except its noncoincidence with

 

the rest” (p. 163) [pp. 117-18].

17.”Since an identical state of affairs is observable in writing, another system of signs, we

 

shall use writing to draw some comparisons that will clarify the whole issue. In fact:




“

1)The signs used in writing are arbitrary; there is no connection, for example, between the

 

letter 

t 

and the sound that it designates.

“

2)The value of letters is purely negative and differential. The same person can

((327))

write 

t, 

for instances, in different ways: 

t 

& t. The only requirement is that the sign for 

t 

not be

 

confused in his script with the signs used for 1, 

d, 

etc.

“

3)Values in writing function only through reciprocal opposition within a fixed system that

 

consists of a set number of letters. This third characteristic, though not identical to the second,

 

is closely related to it, for both depend on the first. Since the graphic sign is arbitrary, its form

 

matters little or rather matters only within the limita

tions imposed by the system.

“

4)The means by which the sign is produced is completely unimportant, for it does not affect

 

the system (this also follows from characteristic I). Whether I make the let-ters in white or

 

black, raised or engraved, with pen or chisel—all this is of no importance with respect to their

 

signification” (pp. 165–66) [pp. 119–20].

18. 

“Arbitrary 

and 

differential 

are two correlative qualities” (p. 163) [p. 118].

19. This literal fidelity is expressed:

1.In the critical exposition of Hjelmslev’s attempt (“Au sujet des fondements de la théorie

 

linguistique de L. Hjelmslev,” 

Bulletin de la Société Linguistique de Paris, 

vol. 42, p. 40) :

 

“Hjelmslev is perfectly consistent with himself when he declares that a written text has for the

 

linguist exactly the same value as a spoken text, since the choice of the substance is not

 

important. He refuses even to admit that the spoken substance is primi

tive and the written

 

substance derived. It seems as if it would suffice to make him notice that, but for certain

 

pathological exceptions, all human beings speak, but few know how to write, or that children

 

know how to speak long before they learn how to write. 

I shall therefore not press the point”

 

(italics added) .

2.In the 

Eléments de linguistique générale 

[(Paris, 1961); 

Elements of General Linguistics, 

tr.

 

Elisabeth Palmer (London, 1964) ], where all the chapters on the vocal character of language

 

pick up the words and arguments of Chapter VI of the 

Course: 

“[One learns to speak before

 

learning to read:] reading comes as a reflection of spoken usage: 

the reverse is never true”

 

(italics added. This proposition seems to me to be thoroughly debatable, even on the level of

 

that common experience which has the force of law within this argument.) Martinet

 

concludes: “The study of writing is a discipline distinct from linguistics proper, although

 

practically speaking it is one of its dependencies. Thus the linguist in principle operates

 

without regard for written forms” (p. 11) [p. 17]. We see how the concepts of 

dependency 

and

 

abstraction 

function: writing and its science are alien but not independent; which does not

 

stop them from being, conversely, immanent but not essential. Just enough “outside” not to

 

affect the integrity of the language 

itself, 

in its pure original self-identity, in its property; just

 




enough “inside” not to have the right to any practical or epistemological independence. And

 

vice versa.

Which does not prevent Hjelmslev from “venturing to call” his directing principle

 

an “empirical principle” (p. 12, English translation, p. 11) . “But,” he adds, “we are willing to

 

abandon the name if espistemological investigation shows it to be inappropriate. From our

 

point of view this is merely a question of terminology, which does not affect the maintenance

 

of the principle.” This is only one example of the termi

nological conventionalism of a system,

 

which, in borrowing all its concepts from the history of the metaphysics that it would hold at a

 

distance (form/substance, context/ expression, etc.), believes it can neutralize its entire

 

historical burden by means of some declaration of intention, a preface or quotation marks.

28.As for this critique of the concept of origin in general (empirical and/or tran

scendental) we

 

have elsewhere attempted to indicate the schema of an argument (Intro

duction to Husserl’s

 

L’origine de la géométrie, 

p. 6o) .

29.Op. Cit., p. 111. Hjelmslev formulates the same reservations: “It is curious that linguistics,

 

so long on guard against any suspicion of ‘psychologism,’ seems here, even if only to a

 

certain extent and in very cautious proportions, to be on its way back to Saussure’s ‘acoustic

 

image,’ and equally to ‘concept,’ as long as that word is interpreted in strict conformity with

 

the doctrine that I have just elaborated, in short to recognize, with however many necessary

 

reservations, that, with the two aspects of the linguistic sign, one is in the presence of the

 

‘purely psychological phenomenon’ 

(Course, 

p. 

28) 

[p. 11]. But it is rather a partial

 

coincidence of nomenclatures than a real analogy. The terms introduced by Saussure, and the

 

interpretations given in the 

Course, 

have been abandoned because they can be equivocal, and

 

it is better not to make the same mistakes again. I too hesitate when I ask myself how much

 

the researches advocated here may be considered as belonging to the psychological order: the

 

reason being that psy

chology seems to be a discipline whose definition still leaves much to be

 

desired” (“La stratification du langage” Essais 

linguistiques 

[1954], p. 56). Hjelmslev, posing

 

the same problem, already evoked those “numerous nuances that the Genevan master could be

 

fully aware of, but which he did not find it useful to insist upon; the motives behind this

 

attitude naturally escapes us” (p. 76) .

30.I have attempted a reading of Freud from this point of view (“Freud et la scène de

 

l’écriture,” 

L’écriture et la différence) . 

It sets forth the relationship between the concept of

 

the trace and the structure of “a-retardation” which I mention above.

31.This theme inhabits more than one mythological system. Among many other examples,

 

Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing evoked in 

Phaedrus, 

inventor of the tech

nical ruse, the

 

analogue of Hermes, also performed essential functions in funeral rites. When the opportunity

 

offered, he was the conductor of the dead. He inscribed the accounts before the Last

 

Judgment. He also occupied the function of the secretary/ substitute who usurped first place;

 

of the king, the father, the sun, of their eye. For ex-ample: “As a general rule, Horus’ eye

 

became the lunar eye. The moon, like everything that touched the astral world, intrigued the

 

Egyptians greatly. According to one legend, the moon was created by the Sun-god to replace

 

itself at night: it was Thoth whom Rê designated for the exercise of this high function of

 




substitution. Another myth tried to explain the vicissitudes of the moon by a periodic battle

 

whose protagonists were Horus and Seth. During the combat, Horus’ eye was wrenched out,

 

but Seth, finally

((329))

vanquished, was obliged to return to his victorious opponent the eye that he had lifted;

 

according to another version, the eye returned on its own, or was brought back by Thoth.

 

Whatever the case might have been, Horus received his eye back joyfully, and put it back in

 

its place after purifying it. The Egyptians called that eye 

oudjat, 

‘the healthy one.’ We shall

 

see that the 

oudjat 

eye played a considerable role in the funerary religion, in the Osirian

 

legend, and in the sacrificial ceremony. This legend .. . later received a solar counterpart: it

 

was said that the universal master, at the origin of the world, was seen, for some unknown

 

reason, to be without an eye. He charged Shou and Tefnout to bring it back. The absence of

 

the two messengers lasted so long that Rê was obliged to replace the unfaithful eye. The eye,

 

when it was brought back by Shou and Tefnout, became very angry (a), seeing that its place

 

had been taken. In appease-ment, Rè transformed it into the serpent-uraeus and placed it on

 

his forehead as the symbol of his power; furthermore, he charged it to defend him against his

 

enemies. (a) The eye shed tears 

(rémyt) 

from which men were born 

(rémet); 

the mythic origin

 

of men clearly rests upon a simple wordplay” (Jacques Vandier, 

La religion égyptienne, 

P.U.F.

 

[Paris, 1944], pp. 39–40). This myth of substitution can be related to the story of the eye in

 

Rousseau (cf. below, p. 212, 148-49).

Mercure de France 

(February 1964) : 254. Presenting this text, Starobinski evokes the

 

musical model and concludes: “This reading is developed according to another 

tempo 

(and in

 

another time) ; at the very limit, one leaves the time of ‘consecutivity’ proper to habitual

 

language.” One could of course say “proper to the habitual concept” of time and of language.

38.I have chosen to demonstrate the necessity of this “deconstruction” by privileging the

 

Saussurian references, not only because Saussure still dominates contemporary linguistics and

 

semiology; it is also because he seems to me to hold himself at the limit: at the same time

 

within the metaphysics that must be deconstructed and beyond the concept of the sign

 

(signifier/signified) which he still uses. But Saussure’s scruples, his interminable hesitations,

 

particularly in the matter of the difference between the two “aspects” of the sign and in the

 

matter of “arbitrariness,” are better realized through reading Robert Codel’s 

Les sources

 




manuscrites du cours de linguistique générale 

([Ge-neva], 1957) pp. 190 f. Suffice it to say

 

here that it is not impossible that the literality of the 

Course, 

to which we have indeed had to

 

refer, should one day appear very suspect in the light of unpublished material now being

 

prepared for publication. I am thinking particularly of the 

Anagrams 

[now published, see note

 

4]. Up to what point is Saussure responsible for the 

Course 

as it was edited and published

 

after his death? It is not a new question. Need we specify that, 

here at least, 

we cannot

 

consider it to be pertinent? Unless my project has been fundamentally misunderstood, it

 

should be clear by now that, caring very little about Ferdinand de Saussure’s 

very 

thought

 

itself, 

I have interested myself in a 

text 

whose literality has played a well-known role since

 

1915, operating within a system of readings, influences, misunderstandings, borrowings,

 

refuta

tions, etc. What I could read—and equally what I could not read—under the title of A

 

Course in General Linguistics 

seemed important to the point of excluding all hidden and

 

“true” intentions of Ferdinand de Saussure. If one were to discover that this text hid another

 

text—and there will never by anything but texts—and hid it in a determined sense, the reading

 

that I have just proposed would not be invalidated, at least for that particular reason. Quite the

 

contrary. Besides, at the very end of their first “Preface,” the editors of the 

Course 

themselves

 

foresee this situation.

Part I: Chapter 3

1.On the empirical difficulties of a research into empirical origins, cf. M. Cohen, 

La grande

 

invention de l’écriture 

([Paris], 1958), Book I, pp. 3 f. With 

L’histoire de l’écriture, 

by J. G.

 

Février (1948—59), it is in France the most important work on the general history of writing.

 

Madeleine V.-David has studied them in 

Critique 

[157] (June 1960).

2.Madeleine V.-David proposes a particular explanation for it. “It is certain that, in nineteenth-

century thought, a gap is produced following the too exclusive apology for the facts of

 

language (begun by Herder) . Paradoxically, the century of the great decipherings made a

 

tabula rasa of the long preparation for those decipherings, by parad-ing the century’s

 

disaffection from the problem of signs. . . . Thus a gap remains to be filled, a continuity to be

 

reestablished. . . . One can do no better than to indicate .. . the Leibnizian texts which deal,

 

often conjointly, with the facts of Chinese and the projects for a universal writing, and the

 

multiple positions possible for writing and for the spoken. . . . But perhaps we do not suffer

 

only from the blindness of the nine

teenth century with regard to signs. Undoubtedly the fact

 

that we are ‘alphabetic’ writers also conspires strongly in hiding from us such essential

 

aspects of the activity of writing” (Discussion, EP, pp. 352—53)

3.She has done it particularly in 

Les dieux et le destin en Babylonie (P.U.F., 

1949) ; (cf.

 

especially the last chapter on “The Reign of Writing”) and in many articles in the 

Revue

9.I would like to restore the context of this quotation: “I believe, however, that it would be

 

possible to devise a further system to enable one to make up the primitive words and their

 

symbols in such a language so that it could be learnt very quickly. Order is what it needed: all

 

the thoughts which can come into the human mind must be arranged in an order like the

 

natural order of the numbers. In a single day one can learn to name every one of the infinite

 

series of numbers, and thus to write infinitely many different words in an unknown language.

 

The same could be done for all the other words necessary to express all the other things which

 

fall within the purview of the human mind. If this secret were discovered I am sure that the

 

language would soon spread throughout the world. Many people would willingly spend five

 

or six days in learning how to make themselves understood by the whole human race.

“

But I do not think that your author has thought of this. There is nothing in all his propositions

 

to suggest it, and in any case the discovery of such a language depends upon the true

 

philosophy. For without that philosophy it is impossible to number and order all the thoughts

 

of men or even to separate them out into clear and simple thoughts, which in my opinion is

 

the great secret for acquiring true scientific knowledge. If someone were to explain correctly

 

what are the simple ideas in the human imagination out of which all human thoughts are

 

compounded, and if his explanation were generally received, I would dare to hope for a

 

universal language very easy to learn, to speak, and to write. The greatest advantage of such a

 

language would be the assistance it would give to men’s

((331))

judgment, representing matters so clearly that it would be almost impossible to go wrong. As

 

it is, almost all our words have confused meanings, and men’s minds are so ac

customed to

 

them that there is hardly anything which they can perfectly understand.

“

I think it is possible to invent such a language”

pp. 5—6].

to go through and exhaust the entire content of the project. I refer on this point to works

 

already cited. Like Leibniz when he wishes to recall in a letter the link between the existence

 

of God and the possibility of a universal script, I shall say here that “it is a proposition that

 

[we] cannot demonstrate properly without explaining the foundations of the characteristic at

 

length. . . . But at present, suffice it to remark that the foundation of my characteristic is also

 

the demonstration of the existence of God, for simple thoughts are the elements of the

 

characteristic, and simple forms are the source of things. Now I maintain that all simple forms

 

are com

patible among themselves. It is a proposition that I cannot demonstrate properly with-

out explaining the foundations of the characteristic at length. But if it is granted, then it

 

follows that the nature of God which holds absolutely all simple forms, is possible. Now we

 

have proved above, that God is, provided He is possible. Therefore He exists. Which had to be

 

demonstrated.” (Letter to the Princess Elizabeth, 1678) There is an essential connection

 

between the possibility of the 

ontological argument 

and that of the Characteristic.

celebrated mathematician and great linguist, that their language is artificial, 

i.e. 

had been

 

invented all at once by some clever man in order to establish verbal intercourse between the

 

large number of dif

this language may now be found altered by long use” (III. I. S 1) .

26.Op cit., p. 2 [p. 110]. Madeleine V.-David criticizes this instrumentalism in the works

also often inspires the linguistic definition of the essence of language, assimilated into a

 

function, and, what is more significant, into a function exterior to its content or its agent. This

 

is always implied by the concept of the utensil. Thus André Martinet accepts responsibility for

 

and develops at length the definition of language as 

“instrument,” “tool,” etc., whereas the

 

“metaphoric” nature of this definition, recog

nized by the author, ought to have made it

 

problematic and to have renewed the ques

tion of instrumentality, of the meaning of

 

functioning, and of the functioning of mean-ing.

In a totally different context, we have

 

elsewhere specified the 

epoch 

of writing as the suspension of 

being-upright 

(“Force et

 

signification” and “La parole soufflée” in 

L’écriture et la différence).

32.Bk. I, chap. IV. In particular, the author shows there that “the emergence of writing no

 

more develops out of a graphic nothingness than does the emergence of agriculture without

 

the intervention of anterior states” (p. 278) ; and that “ideography is anterior to pictography”

 

(p. 280) .

33.Certain remarks of Leroi-Gourhan on “the loss of multi-dimensional symbolic thought”

 

and on the thought that “separates itself from linearized language” can perhaps be interpreted

 

thus.

34. Cf. 

EP, 

pp. 138—39; GP I, pp. 238-50. 

“The development of the first cities not only

 

corresponds to the appearance of the technician of fire but . . . writing is born at the same time

 

as metallurgy. Here too, it is not a coincidence . . .” (I, p. 252). “It is at the moment when

 

agrarian capitalism begins to establish itself that the means of sta

bilizing it in written balance

 

accounts appears and it is also at the moment when social hierarchization is affirmed that

 

writing constructs its first genealogists” (p. 253). “The appearance of writing is not fortuitous;

 

after millennia of maturation in the systems of mythographic representation the linear notation

 

of thought emerges at the same time as metal and slavery (see chapter VI). Its content is not

 

fortuitous” (II, p. 67; cf. also pp. 161-62).

Although it is now much better known and described, this structural solidarity, par

ticularly

 

between capitalization and writing, has long been known: among many others, by Rousseau,

 

Court de Gebelin, Engels, etc.

35. Linear writing has therefore indeed “constituted, during many millennia, inde

pendently of

 

its role as conserver of the collective memory, by its unfolding in one dimension alone, the

 

instrument of analysis out of which grew philosophic and scientific thought. The conservation

 

of thought can now be conceived otherwise than in terms of books which will only for a short

 

time keep the advantage of their rapid manageability. A vast ‘tape-library’ with an electronic

 

selection system will in the near future show pre-selected and instantaneously retrieved

 

information. Reading will still retain its im-

((333))

portance for some centuries to come, in spite of its perceptible regression for most men, but

 

writing [understood in the sense of linear inscription] seems likely to disappear rapidly,

 

replaced by automatic dictaphones. Should one see in this a sort of restoration of the state

 

anterior to the phonetic confiscation of the hand? I should rather think that it is here a question

 




of an aspect of the general phenomenon of manual regression (see p. 6o) and of a new

 

liberation.’ As to the long-term consequences in terms of the forms of reasoning, and a return

 

to diffuse and multidimensional thought, they cannot be now foreseen. Scientific thought is

 

rather hampered by the necessity of drawing itself out in typographical channels and it is

 

certain that if some procedure would permit the presen

tation of books in such a way that the

 

materials of the different chapters are presented simultaneously in all their aspects, authors

 

and their users would find a considerable advantage. It is absolutely certain that if scientific

 

reasoning has clearly nothing to lose with the disappearance of writing, philosophy and

 

literature will definitely see their forms evolve. This is not particularly regrettable since

 

printing will conserve the curiously archaic forms of thought that men will have used during

 

the period of alphabetic graphism; as to the new forms, they will be to the old ones as steel to

 

flint, not only a sharper but a more flexible instrument. Writing will pass into the

 

infrastructure without altering the functioning of intelligence, as a transition which will have

 

some centuries of primacy” (GP, II, 

pp. 

261-62. See also 

EP, Conclusion).

36.The “XXIIe Semaine de synthèse,” a colloquium whose contents were collected in

 

L’écriture et la psychologie des peuples, 

was placed under the rubric of this remark of Marcel

 

Cohen’s (“La grande invention de l’écriture et son evolution”). But at each moment the rich

 

suggestions made during the colloquium point beyond the graphological project. Mr. Cohen

 

himself recognizes the difficulty and the premature character of such a task: “We can

 

obviously not begin to deal with the graphology of peoples; it would be too delicate, too

 

difficult. But we can express the idea that it is not only because of tech

nical reasons that there

 

are differences, there may be something else” (p. 342).

37.Text of 1923, collected in the 

Essais de psychanalyse, 

tr. fr., pp. 

95 

f. I shall quote a few

 

lines: “For Fritz, when he was 

writing, 

the lines meant roads and the letters ride on motor-

bicycles—on the pen—upon them. For instance, ‘i’ and ‘e’ ride to

gether on a motor-bicycle

 

that is usually driven by the ‘i’ and they love one another with a tenderness quite unknown in

 

the real world. Because they always ride with one another they become so alike that there is

 

hardly any difference between them, for the beginning and the end—he was talking of the

 

small Latin alphabet—of ‘i’ and ‘e’ are the same, only in the middle the ‘i’ has a little stroke

 

and the ‘e’ has a little hole. Concerning the Gothie letters ‘i’ and ‘e,’ he explained that they

 

also ride on a motor-bicycle, and that it is only a difference like another make of bicycle that

 

the ‘e’ has a little box in-stead of the hole in the Latin ‘e.’ The ‘i’s are skillful, distinguished

 

and clever, have many pointed weapons, and live in caves, between which, however, there are

 

also moun

tains, gardens and harbours. They represent the penis, and their path coitus. On the

 

other hand, the ‘l’s are represented as stupid, clumsy, lazy and dirty. They live in caves under

 

the earth. In ‘L’-town dirt and paper gather in the streets, in the little ‘’filthy’ houses they mix

 

with water a dyestuff bought in ‘I’-land and drink and sell this as wine. They cannot walk

 

properly and cannot dig because they hold the spade upside down, etc. It became evident that

 

the l’s represented faeces. Numerous phantasies were concerned with other letters also. Thus,

 

instead of the double ‘s,’ he always wrote only one, until a phantasy afforded the explanation

 

and solution of this inhibition. The one ‘s’ was himself, the other his father. They were to

 

embark together on a motor-boat, for the pen was also a boat, the copy-book a lake. The ‘s’

 

that was himself got into the boat that belonged to the other ‘s’ and sailed away in it quickly

 

upon the lake. This was the reason why he did not write the two ‘s’s’ together. His frequent

 

use of ordinary ‘s’ in place of a long one proved to be determined by the fact that the part of

 

the long ‘s’ that was thus left out was for him as though one were to take away a person’s

 

nose.’ This mistake proved to be determined by the castration-father and disappeared after this

 

interpretation.” I cannot cite here all the analogous examples that Melanie Klein analyzes. Let

 




us read the following passage, of a more general value: “With Ernst as well as with Fritz I

 

could observe that the inhibition in respect of writing and reading, that is,

((334))

the basis for all further school activity, proceeded from the letter ‘i,’ which, with its simple ‘up

 

and down,’ is indeed the foundation of all writing (Note [Klein’s footnote]: At a meeting of

 

the Berlin P. A. Society, Herr Rohr dealt in some detail with the Chinese script and its

 

interpretation on a psychoanalytic basis. In the subsequent dis

cussion I pointed out that the

 

earlier picture-script, which underlies our script too, is still active in the phantasies of every

 

individual child, so that the various strokes dots, etc., of our present script would only be

 

simplifications, achieved as a result of condensa

tion, displacement and other mechanisms

 

familiar to us from dreams and neuroses, of the earlier pictures whose traces, however, would

 

be demonstrable in the individual.) The sexual-symbolic meaning of a penholder is apparent

 

in these examples. . . . It can be ob-served how the sexual-symbolic meaning of the penholder

 

merges into the act of writing that the latter discharges. In the same way the libidinal

 

significance of reading is derived from the symbolic cathexis of the book and the eye. In this

 

there are at work, of course, also other determinants afforded by the component-instincts,

 

such as ‘peeping’ in reading, and exhibitionistic, aggressive sadistic tendencies in writing; at

 

the root of the sexual-symbolic meaning of the penholder lay probably originally that of the

 

weapon and the hand. Corresponding with this too the activity of reading is a more passive,

 

that of writing a more active, one, and for the inhibitions of one or the other of them the

 

various fixations on the pregenital stages of organization are also significant” (tr. fr.

One

 

example among many others of what Métraux calls “attempt at phoneticism” : “Thus, the

 

Cheyenne chief called ‘tortoise-following-his-female’ will be represented by a person with

 

two tortoises above him. ‘Little-man’ will be identified by the silhouette of a child outlined

 

above his head. This expression of proper names hardly raises problems when it is a question

 

of concrete things, but it puts the imagination of the scribe to a hard test if he has to render

 

abstract ideas through pictography. To transcribe the name of a person called ‘highway,’ an

 

Oglagla Indian had recourse to the following symbolic combination: strokes parallel to

 

footprints make us think of ‘road,’ a bird painted close to it evokes the rapidity which is

 

evidently one of the attributes of ‘good routes.’ It is clear that only those who already know

 

the names corresponding to these symbols can decipher them. On that count, these designs

 

will have a mnemotechnic value. As another example, let us take the proper name ‘Good-

Weasel.’ From the animal’s mouth, drawn in a realistic fashion, emerge two wavy lines that

 




ordinarily symbolize the flow of words. This sign being used for ‘good discourses,’ it is

 

supposed that the reader will only retain the adjective and forget the idea of discourse”

44.Questioning by turns the logico-grammatical structures of the West (and first - Aristotle’s

 

list of categories), showing that no correct description of Chinese writing can tolerate it,

 

Fenollosa recalled that Chinese poetry was essentially a script. He re-marked, for example:

 

“Should we pass formally into the study of Chinese poetry, .. . we should beware of English

 

[occidental] 

grammar, its hard parts of speech, and its lazy satisfaction with nouns and

 

adjectives. We should seek and at least bear in mind the verbal undertone of each noun. We

 

should avoid the ‘is’ and bring in a wealth of neglected English verbs. Most of the existing

 

translations violate all of these rules. The development of the normal transitive sentence rests

 

upon the fact that one action in nature promotes another; thus the agent and the object are

 

secretly verbs. For example,

((335))

our sentence, ‘Reading promotes writing,’ would be expressed in Chinese by three full verbs.

 

Such a form is the equivalent of three expanded clauses and can be drawn out into adjectival,

 

participial, infinitive, relative or conditional members. One of many possible examples is, ‘If

 

one reads it teaches him how to write.’ Another is, ‘One who reads becomes one who writes.’

 

But in the first condensed form a Chinese would write, ‘Read promote write.’ “ “L’écriture

5.The idea of an originarily figurative language was pretty widespread at this time; it is to be

 

found particularly in Warburton and in Condillac, whose influence on Rous-seau is massive in

 

this area. As for Vico: Bernard Gagnebin and Marcel Raymond have asked in connection with

 

the 

Essay on the Origin of Languages, 

if Rousseau had not read the 

Scienza Nuova 

when he

 

was Montaigu’s secretary in Venice. But if Rousseau and Vico both affirm the metaphoric

 

nature of primitive languages, Vico alone attributes to them this divine origin, also the theme

 

of disagreement between Condillac and Rousseau. Moreover, Vico is one of the rare believers,

 

if not the only believer, in the contemporaneity of origin between writing and speech:

 

“Philologists [Derrida’s version would incorrectly read “philosophers”] have believed that

 

among the nations languages first came into being and then letters; whereas . . . letters and

 

languages were born twins and proceeded apace through all their three stages”

6.”What we have here are thus two extreme types of proper name between which there are a

 

whole series of intermediate cases. At one extreme, the name is an identifying mark which, by

 

the application of a rule, establishes that the individual who is 

named 

is a member of a

 

preordained class (a social group in a system of groups, a status by birth in a system of

 

statuses) . At the other extreme, the name is a free creation on the part of the individual who

 

gives the name 

and expresses a transitory and subjective state of his own by means of the

 

person he names. But can one be said to be really naming in either case? The choice seems

 

only to be between identifying someone else by assigning him to a class or, under cover of

 

giving him a name, identifying oneself through him. One therefore never names: one

 

classifies someone else if the name is given to him in virtue of his characteristics and one

 

classifies oneself if, in the belief that one need not follow a rule, one names someone else

 

‘freely,’ that is, in virtue of characteristics of one’s own. And most commonly one does both at

 

once” (p. 240) [p. 181]. Cf. also “The Individual as A Species” and “Time Recaptured”

 

(chapters 7 and 8) : “In every system, therefore, proper names represent the quanta of

 

signification 

below which one no longer does anything but point. This brings us to the root of

 

the parallel mistakes com

mitted by Peirce and by Russell, the former’s in defining proper

 

names as ‘indices’ and the latter’s in believing that he had discovered the logical model of

 

proper names in demonstrative pronouns. This amounts in effect to allowing that the act of

 

naming belongs to a continuum in which there is an imperceptible passage from the act of

 

signifying to that of pointing. I hope that I have succeeded in showing that this passage is in

 

fact discontinuous although each culture fixes its thresholds differently. The natural sciences

 

put theirs on the level of species, varieties or subvarieties as the case may be. So terms of

 

different degrees of generality will be regarded each time as proper names” (pp. 285–86) [p.

 

215].

Radicalizing this intention, it should perhaps be asked if it is any longer legitimate to refer to

 

the pre-nominal “property” of pure “monstration”—pointing at—if pure indi

cation, as the

 

zero degree of language, as “sensible certitude,” is not a myth always already effaced by the

 

play of difference. It should perhaps be said of indication “proper” what Lévi-Strauss says of

 

proper names: “At the lower end there is no external limit to the system either, since it

 

succeeds in treating the qualitative diversity of natural species as the symbolic material of an

 

order, and its progress towards the concrete, particular and individual is not even arrested by

 

the obstacle of personal appellations: even proper names can serve as terms for a

 

classification” (p. 288) [p. 218] (cf. also p. 242) [pp. 182–831.

7.[Pp. 269–70]. Since we read Rousseau in the transparence of the texts, why not slide under

 

this scene that other taken out of a 

Promenade 

(9) ? In spelling out all its elements one by one

 

and minutely, I shall be less attentive to the opposition of term to term than to the rigorous

 

symmetry of such an opposition. Everything happens as if Rousseau had developed the

 

reassuring positive whose impression Lévi-Strauss gives us in the negative. Here is the scene:

 

“But, soon weary of emptying my purse to make people crush each other, I left the good

 

company and went to walk alone in the fair. The variety of the objects there amused me for a

 

long time. I perceived among others five or six boys from Savoy, around a small girl who had

 

still on her tray a dozen meagre apples, which she was anxious to get rid of; the Savoyards, on

 

their side, would have gladly freed her of them; but they had only two or three pence among

 

them all, and that was not much to make a great breach among the apples. This tray was for

 

them the garden of the Hesperides; and the young girl was the dragon who guarded it. This

 

comedy amused me for a long time; I finally created a climax by paying for the apples from

 

the young girl and distributing them among the small boys. I had then one of the finest

 

spectacles that can flatter a man’s heart, that of seeing joy united with the innocence of youth,

 




spreading everywhere about me. For the spectators themselves, in seeing it, partook of it, and

 

I, who shared at such cheap expense this happiness, had in addition the joy of feeling that it

 

was my work” 

(Pléiade, I, 

pp. 1092–93;

((337))

8.Of that word and that concept which, as I had suggested at the outset, has sense only within

 

the logocentric closure and the metaphysics of presence. When it does not imply the

 

possibility of an intuitive or judicative 

adequation, 

it nevertheless continues in 

aletheia 

to

 

privilege the instance of a vision filled and satisfied by presence. It is the same reason that

 

prevents the thought of writing to be simply contained within a science, indeed an

 

epistemological circle. It can have neither that ambition nor that modesty.

9.A situation difficult to describe in Rousseauist terms, the professed absence of writing

 

complicating things yet further: 

The Essay on the Origin of Languages 

would perhaps give

 

the name “savagery” to the state of society and writing described by Lévi-Strauss: “These

 

three ways of writing correspond almost exactly to three different stages according to which

 

one can consider men gathered into a nation. The depicting of objects is appropriate to a

 

savage people; signs of words and of propositions, to a barbaric people, and the alphabet to

 

civilized peoples 

[peuples policés]” 

[p. 17].

10. “If the West has produced anthropologists, it is because it was so tormented by remorse”

 

(“A Little Glass of Rum,” 

Tristes Tropiques, 

chap. 38) [(p. 449) [p. 388]].

11.What one may read between the lines of the second 

Disource: 

“It is reason that engenders

 

self-love, and reflection that confirms it: it is reason which turns man back upon himself, and

 

divides him from everything that disturbs or afflicts him. It is phi

losophy that isolates him,

 

and it is through philosophy that he says in secret, at the sight of the misfortunes of others:

 

‘Perish if you will, I am secure’ “ (p. 6o) [p. 184].

the philosophies that take their “point of departure in the cogito” 

(p. 242).

Conversations 

with Georges Charbonnier which adds nothing to the

 

theoretical substance of the “Writing Lesson.”

Tristes Tropiques, 

chap. 40: “In its own awy, and on its own level, each of them

 

corresponds to a truth. Between Marxist criticism which sets Man free from his first chains,

 

and Buddhist criticism, which completes that liberation, there is neither opposi

tion nor

 

contradiction. (The Marxist teaches that the apparent significance of Man’s condition will

 

vanish the moment he agrees to enlarge the object that he has under consideration.) Marxism

 

and Buddhism are doing the same thing, but at different levels” (p. 476) [P. 395].

19.On this theme of chance, present in 

Race et histoire 

[published in French and English

 

(Race and History) 

Paris, 1952] and in 

The Savage Mind, 

cf. above all the 

Conversations, 

pp.

 

28—29 [pp. 24—26]; in developing at length the image of the gambler at the roulette wheel,

 

Lévi-Strauss explains that the complex combination that consti

tutes Western civilization, with

 

its type of historicity, determined by the use of writing, could very well have developed at the

 

beginning of humanity, it could have developed very much later, it developed at this moment,

 

“there is no reason why this should be so, it just is. However, you may say: ‘That is not very

 

satisfactory.’ “ This chance is soon after determined as the “acquisition of writing.” This is an

 

hypothesis that Lévi-Strauss admittedly does not abide by but of which he says “we should

 

begin by considering it as a possibility.” Even if it does not imply a belief in chance (cf. 

The

 

Savage Mind, 

pp. 22 and 291 [pp. 13—14 and 220] ), a certain structuralism must invoke it in

 

order to inter-relate the absolute specificities of structural totalities. We shall see how this

 

necessity is also imposed on Rousseau.

20.It concerns only a small subgroup which is followed by the anthropologist only in its

 

nomadic period. This subgroup has a sedentary life as well. In the introduction to the thesis

 

one will find: “It is unnecessary to emphasize that this is not an exhaustive study of

 

Nambikwara life and society. We were able to share the life of the natives only during

((338))

the nomadic period, and that alone would suffice to limit the range of our investigation. A

 

voyage undertaken during the sedentary period would no doubt bring essential pieces of

 

information and would correct the whole view. We hope one day to be able to under-take it”

 

(p. 3). Is this limitation, which seems to have been definitive, not particularly significant with

 

respect to the question of writing, which is clearly linked more intimately than most things

 

and in an essential way, with the phenomenon of sedentarity?

”For thousands of years, after all, and still today in a great part of the world, writing has

 

existed as an institution in societies in which the vast majority of people are quite unable to

 




write. The villages where I stayed in the Chittagong hills in Pakistan [now Bangladesh] are

 

populated by illiterates; yet each village has a scribe who fulfills his function for the benefit

 

both of individual citizens and of the village as a whole. They all know what writing is and, if

 

need be, 

can 

write: but they do it from outside as if it were a mediator, foreign to themselves,

 

with which they communicate by an oral process. But the scribe is rarely a functionary or an

 

employee of the group as a whole; his knowledge is a source of power—so much so, in fact,

 

that the functions of scribe and usurer are often united in the same human being. This is not

 

merely because the usurer needs to be able to read and write to carry on his trade, but because

 

he has thus a twofold 

empire over 

his fellows” (p. 342) [pp. 290-91].

[LIV, iii & iv,] 1949, [pp.

p. 33 [pp. 25-26]): “The anthropologist is above all

 

interested in unwritten data, not so much because the peoples he studies are incapable of

 

writing, but because that with which he is principally concerned differs from everything men

 

ordinarily think of recording on stone or on paper.”

25.Recalling, in “A Little Glass of Rum,” that “In the neolithic age, Man had already made

 

most of the inventions which are indispensable to his security. We have seen why writing need

 

not be included among these,” Lévi-Strauss remarks that man in earlier times was certainly

 

“no more free than he is today.” “But it was his humanness alone which kept him enslaved. As

 

he had only a very restricted control over Nature, he was protected, and to a certain degree

 

emancipated, by the protective cushion of his dreams” (p. 452) [p. 390]. Cf. also the theme of

 

the “neolithic paradox” in 

The Savage Mind,

answers as ask the right questions” 

(The Raw and the Cooked, p. 

15) [p. 7].

27.”Facilitate,” “favor,” “reinforce,” such are the words chosen to describe the opera

4.Ibid. Without looking for a principle of reading there, I refer, out of curiosity and from

 

among many other possible examples, to what Karl Abraham says of the Cyclops, of the fear

 

of being blind, of the eye, of the sun, of masturbation etc. in 

Oeuvres complètes, 

tr. Ilse

 

Barande [and E. Grin (Payot, 1965) ] II, pp. 18 f. Let us recall that in a sequence of Egyptian

 

mythology, Seth, helper of Thoth (god of writing here considered as a brother of Osiris), kills

 

Osiris by trickery (cf. Vandier, op. cit., p. 46) . Writing, auxiliary and suppletory, kills the

 

father and light in the same gesture (Cf. supra, p. 101, 328–29 n. 31).

5. “‘Little one’ was my name; ‘Mama’ was hers; and we always remained ‘Little one’ and

 

‘Mama,’ even when advancing years had almost obliterated the difference between us. I find

 

that these two names give a wonderfully good idea of the tone of our inter-course, of the

 

simplicity of our manners, and, above all, of the mutual relation of our hearts. For me she was

 

the tenderest of mothers, who never sought her own pleasure, but always what was best for

 

me; and if sensuality entered at all into her attachment for me, it did not alter its character, but

 

only rendered it more enchanting, and intoxicated me with the delight of having a young and

 

pretty mamma whom it was delightful to me to caress—I say caress in the strictest sense of

 

the word, for it never occurred to her to be sparing of kisses and the tenderest caresses of a

 

mother, and it certainly never entered my mind to abuse them. It will be objected that, in the

 

end, we had relations of a different character; I admit it, but I must wait a little—I cannot say

 

all at once” (p. 106) [p. 109]. Let us add this sentence from Georges Bataille: “I am myself the

 

‘little one,’ I have only a hidden place” 

(Le petit 

[2d edition (Paris, 1963), p. 9] ) .

6.This passage is often cited, but has it ever been analyzed for itself? The Pléiade editors of

 

the 

Confessions, 

Gagnebin and Raymond, are no doubt right in being cautious, as they are,

 

systematically and inevitbaly, of what they call psychiatry (note p. 1281. This same note

 

checks off very usefully all the texts where Rousseau recalls his “follies” or “extravagances.”)

 

But this caution is not legitimate, it seems to me, except to the extent that it concerns the

 

abuse—which has hitherto no doubt been confounded with the use—of psychoanalytic

 

reading, and where it does not prescribe the duplication of the usual commentary which has

 

rendered this kind of text most often unreadable. We must distinguish here between, on the

 

one hand, the often hasty and careless, but often also enlightening, analyses by Dr. René

 

Laforgue (“Etude sur J.-J. Rousseau,” in 

Revue française de psychanalyse, I, ii [1927], 

pp.

 

370 

f.; and 

Psychopathologie de l’échec 

[1944], [Paris], pp. 114 f.), which moreover do not

 

consider the texts I have just cited, and, on the other hand, an interpretation which would take

 




into more rigorous account, at least in principle, the teachings of psychoanalysis. That is one

 

of the direc

tions in which Jean Starobinski’s fine and careful analyses are engaged. Thus, in

 

L’oeil vivant, 

the sentence that has given us pause is reinscribed within an entire series of

 

examples of analogous substitution, borrowed mostly from the 

Nouvelle Héloise; 

this one for

 

example, among other “erotic fetishes”: “All the parts of your scattered dress present to my

 

ardent imagination those of your body that they conceal. This delicate headdress which sets

 

off the large blond curls which it pretends to cover; this happy bodice shawl against which at

 

least once I shall not have to complain; this elegant and simple gown which displays so well

 

the taste of the wearer; these dainty slippers that a supple foot fills so easily; this corset so

 

slender which touches and embraces . . . what an enchanting form . . . in front two gentle

 

curves . . . oh voluptuous sight . . . the whalebone has yielded to the force of the impression . .

 

. delicious imprints, let me kiss you a thousand times!” (p. 147 [tr. Judith H. McDowell

 

(University Park and London, 1968), pp. 122-23].

((340))

But do the singularity of these substitutions and the articulation of these displace

ments hold

 

the attention of the interpreter? I wonder if, too concerned with reacting against a reductionist,

 

causalist, dissociative psychology, Starobinski does not in general give too much credit to a

 

totalitarian psychoanalysis of the phenomenological or existentialist style. Such a

 

psychoanalysis, diffusing sexuality in the totality of be

havior, perhaps risks blurring the

 

cleavages, the differences, the displacements, the fixations of all sorts that structure that

 

totality. Do the place or the places of sexuality not disappear in the analysis of global

 

behavior, as Starobinski recommends: “Erotic behavior is not a fragmentary given; it is the

 

manifestation of a total individual, and it is as such that it ought to be analyzed. Whether it is

 

to neglect it or to make it a privileged subject of study, one cannot limit exhibitionism to the

 

sexual ‘sphere’: the entire personality is revealed there, with some of its fundamental

 

‘existential choices.’ 

«

 

 

(La transparence et l’obstacle, 

pp. 21 o—i I. A note refers us to the

 

Phénoménologie de la perception 

of [Maurice] Merleau-Ponty [(Paris, 1945);

 

Phenomenology of Perception, 

tr. 

Colin Smith (New York, 1965n). And does one not, in this

 

way, risk determining the pathological in a very classic manner, as “excess” thought within

 

“existential” categories: “In, the perspective of a global analysis, it will appear that certain

 

primary givens of consciousness constitute at the same time the source of Rousseau’s

 

speculative thought, and the source of his follly. But these given-sources are not morbid by

 

them-selves. It is only because they are lived in an excessive manner, that the malady de

clares

 

itself and is developed. . . . The morbid development will realize the caricatural placing in

 

evidence of a fundamental ‘existential’ question that consciousness was not able to dominate”

 

(p. 253)

7.Page 165 [p. 171].

8.In these celebrated pages of the first Book of the 

Confessions, 

Rousseau com

pares the first

 

experiences of reading (“secret and ill-chosen reading”) to the first discoveries of auto-

eroticism. Not that the “filthy and licentious [books]” encouraged him in it. Quite the

 

contrary. “Chance aided my modest disposition so well, that I was more than thirty years old

 

before I set eyes upon any of those dangerous books which a fine lady finds inconvenient

 




because they can only be read with one hand” (p. 40) [p. 40]. Without these “dangerous

 

books,” Jean-Jacques gives himself to other dangers. The continuation of the paragraph which

 

closes thus is well known: “It is sufficient for me to have defined the origin and first cause of

 

a propensity which has modified all my passions, and which, restraining them by means of

 

themselves, has always made me slow to act, owing to my excessive impetuosity in desire”

 

(p. 41) [p. 41]. The intention and the letter of this passage should be related to another page of

 

the 

Confessions 

(p. 444 [p. 459]. Cf. also the editors’ note), and to the page from which I

 

quote these lines: “for I have always had a fancy for reading while eating, if I am alone; it

 

supplies the want of society. I devour alternately a page and a morsel. It seems as if my book

 

were dining with me” (p. 269) [p. 278].

his essay Rousseau connects the degradation of morals, the corruption of pronunciation, and

 

the progress of writing. He even cites the examples of corruptions whose occurrence he had

 

the dubious privilege of witnessing, and which are caused by a “fault of pronunciation in the

 

organ, or in the intonation, or in the habit.” “Words whose change in pronunciation I have

 

witnessed: Charolois [Sharolwa]—Charolès [Shar

edition of the

 

Discourse, 

to which I refer here (vol. 3, p. 154; Italics added.)

13.Italics added. The examples chosen by Rousseau are not insignificant: “Not to mention the

 

tenderness of mothers for their offspring and the perils they encounter to save them from

 

danger, it is well known that horses show a reluctance to trample on living bodies. One animal

 

never passes by the dead body of another of its species without being disturbed: there are even

 

some which give their fellows a sort of burial; while the mournful lowings of the cattle when

 

they enter the slaughter-house show the impressions made on them by the horrible spectacle

 

which meets them. We find, with pleasure, the author of 

The Fable of the Bees 

obliged to own

 

that man is a compassionate and sensible being, and laying aside his cold subtlety of style, in

 

the example he gives, to present us with the pathetic description of a man who, from a place

 

of confinement, is compelled to behold a wild beast tear a child from the arms of its mother,

 

grinding its tender limbs with its murderous teeth, and tearing its palpitating entrails with its

 

claws. What horrid agitation must not the eye-witness of such a scene experience, although he

 

would not be personally concerned! What anxiety would he not suffer at not being able to

 




give any assistance to the fainting mother and the dying infant! Such is the pure emotion of

 

nature, prior to all kinds of reflection!”

((342))

14.I ask if one may, like Derathé, oppose the doctrine of 

Emile 

to that of the Second

 

Discourse 

on this point (“In 

Emile 

pity becomes a sentiment derived from the love of self

 

whereas the second 

Discourse 

would set these two principles against each other” 

Le

 

rationalisme de J.-J. Rousseau, pp. 

99-100) .

15.It is known that Rousseau had projected writing an entire work on the role of women in

 

history. It seems that for him the question was as much of restoring an his

torical truth (the

 

importance of woman’s role, which the history of man has deliberately dissimulated) as of

 

recalling the occasionally pernicious character of that role, through making “some

 

observations on great men who have allowed themselves to be governed by women.

 

Themistocles, Antony, etc. Fulvia, Antony’s wife, provoked war because she was not loved by

 

Caesar.”

Sur les femmes 

and

face value by Frenchmen of spirit.”

Letter to M. d’Alembert, pp. 

206–07 [pp. 103–04]. See also the note on p. 206 [p. 103]. It

 

begins thus: “Women, in general, do not like any art, know nothing about any, and have no

 

genius.” “In the union of the sexes . . . the man should be strong and active; the woman should

 

be weak and passive” 

(Emile, p. 

446) [p. 322].

Is it not remarkable that Nietzsche, sharing completely this conception of femininity, of the

 

degradation of culture, and of the genealogy of morals as servitude to the slave, should have

 

hated Rousseau? Is it not remarkable that he thought Rousseau an emi

nent representative of

 

the slave morality? Is it not remarkable that he should have seen precisely in pity the true

 

subversion of culture and the form of servitude of the masters?

There is much to say along this line. It will lead us in particular to a comparison of the

 

Rousseauist and Nietzschean models of femininity; domination or seduction is equally feared,

 

whether it takes, alternatively or simultaneously, the form of cloying sweetness, or of

 

destructive or devouring fury. It would be a mistake to interpret these models as 

simple

 

affirmations of virility. Perhaps Novalis saw more profoundly and beyond what Rousseau

 

himself calls at the beginning of 

The Confessions 

(p. 12) [p. io] his “char

acter so effeminate.”

 

“Rousseau’s 

philosophèmes 

are, absolutely speaking, a feminine philosophy or a theory of

 

femininity” 

(Encyclopédie,

Le rationalisme de Rousseau,

20.Derathé recalls that 

“Durkheim is . . . the first to have indicated the importance of this

 

notion of potential faculty in Rousseau.”

p. 13. Cf. [Emile]

Revue de métaphysique et du morale, xxv, i

 

& 

ii, (Jan.–Feb. 1918), pp. 1-23, 129–61. 

Most of Rousseau’s system

atic contradictions would

 

be resolved by bringing into play this concept of a potential faculty which operates as a solder

 

at every point of rupture, and primarily at the points where society breaks—and articulates

 

itself—with Nature. 

Cf. Derathé, 

Rousseau et la science politique de son temps, 

p. 148. 

It is

 

remarkable that this theme of 

potentiality 

should be so often misunderstood, wherever it crops

 

up. This misunderstanding is at the center of the problematics of innate ideas, and of Locke’s

 

relationship with Leibniz, or Leibniz’s with Descartes.

21.Naturally, this argument is marked by a reflection that would associate Kant and Rousseau

 

differently from the chapter on morality. The entire chain that makes possible the

 

communication of the movement of temporalization and the schematism of imagination, pure

 

sensibility and the auto-affection of the present by itself, all that

((343))

Heidegger’s reading has strongly repeated in 

Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics 

could, by

 

way of a carefully staked out path, lead us back on to Rousseauist ground.

22. 

The 

Essay 

allows us to believe as little in original war as in the Golden Age. From these

 

two points of view, the 

Essay 

matches the great Rousseauist theses. In the Geneva manuscript

 

(the first version of 

The Social Contract, 

dating from 1756), Rous-seau writes that “the golden

 

age was always a condition alien to the human race.”

23.Pages 153—54 [pp. 181—82; Cole’s note: Justin, 

Hist. 

ii, 2. So much more does the

 

ignorance of vice profit the one sort than the knowledge of virtue the other.] Cf. also p. 152

 

and the fragment on 

L’état de nature: 

“As long as men retained their first innocence, they

 

needed no guide other than the voice of Nature; as long as they did not become evil, they were

 

dispensed from being good” ([Pléiade, vol. 3,] p. 476).

24.The textual unity of this doctrine of pity is confirmed once again if these four passages are

 

placed side by side: “Although pity is native to the human heart, it would remain eternally

 

quiescent unless it were activated by imagination. How are we moved to pity? By getting

 

outside ourselves and identifying with a being who suffers. We suffer only as much as we

 

believe him to suffer. It is not in ourselves, but in him that we suffer” 

(Essay) 

[p. 32].

“

So pity is born, the first relative sentiment which touches the human heart according to the

 

order of nature. To become sensitive and pitiful the child must know that he has fellow-

creatures who suffer as he has suffered, who feel the pains he has felt, and others which he

 

can form some idea of, being capable of feeling them himself. Indeed, how can we let

 

ourselves be stirred by pity unless we go beyond ourselves, and identify ourselves with the

 

suffering animal, by leaving, so to speak, our own nature and taking his. We only suffer so far

 




as we suppose he suffers; the suffering is not ours but his. So no one becomes sensitive till his

 

imagination is aroused and begins to carry him outside himself” 

(Emile, 

p. 261) [p. 184].

“

It is clear that such transport supposes a great deal of acquired knowledge. How am I to

 

imagine ills of which I have no idea? How would I suffer in seeing another suffer, if I know

 

not what he is suffering, if I am ignorant of what he and I have in common. He who has never

 

been reflective is incapable of being malicious and vindictive. He who imagines nothing is

 

aware only of himself; he is isolated in the midst of mankind” 

(Essay) 

[p. 32].

“

To show the means by which he may be kept in the path of nature is to show plainly enough

 

how he might stray from that path. So long as his consciousness is confined to himself there is

 

no morality in his actions; it is only when it begins to extend beyond himself that he forms

 

first the sentiments and then the ideas of good and ill, which make him indeed a man, and an

 

integral part of his species” 

(Emile, 

p. 257) [p. 181].

The page he devotes to the 

Essay 

shows how Rousseau, and notably

 

the 

Essay, 

might then have normally been read, and allows us to measure the distance to be

 

covered: “Between the 

Discourse on the Sciences 

and the 

Discourse on Inequality, 

one must

 

place 

The Essay on the Origin of Languages. 

Rousseau also gave it the title of Essay on the

 

Principle of Melody. 

In fact in it he deals equally with lan

guage and music; which does not

 

stop him from speaking a great deal about society and its origins. . . . The date of its

 

composition is not perfectly clear; but the context indi

cates it sufficiently. Even the passages

 

therein where Rousseau speaks of the pernicious role of the arts and sciences show that his

 

opinions were already decided on this point: it is well-known that he was yet hesitant at the

 

time of composition of his discourse. He therefore could have written the 

Essay. 

only at a later

 

date. On the other hand, it is easy to see that on the question of society he had not yet formed

 

those radical ideas which he professed in his book on Inequality. (The quotation from the

 

Lettre sur les spectacles 

in

((344))

a note to Chapter 1 is not a serious enough objection. Nothing is simpler, in fact, than a note

 

added after the event.) Such as it is, the Essay offers a curious enough mixture of truth and

 

falsehood, caution and audacity. The method is constantly hypothetical, there are no proofs,

 

the social doctrines are at the very least mediocre. Often one would believe one were reading

 

the 

Inequality: 

same style, same turn of phrase, same investigative procedures, same

 

sequences of reasoning and ideas. But in the midst of all this, there is such caution in the

 




conclusions, such a respect for Holy Writ and tradition, such a faith in Providence, such a

 

horror of the materialist philosophers, that one finds oneself disarmed, as it were. In sum then,

 

Rousseau has created a transitional work here, which presages evil, rather than producing it

 

fully. The good that he placed there might have led him to saner ideas, if he had known how

 

to make use of it; unhappily enough he placed there the germs of those errors which he

 

developed in his later works. A memora

ble example of the care that one must take in order

 

somehow to orient his talent and life well, and what sort of route a principle, pushed to its

 

extreme consequences by an extremist logic, would carve out” (vol. 

I, pp. 323–34)

Annales, 

VIII (1912) : 1.

30.

”This is how Rousseau’s work appears to me: very diverse, tumultuous, agitated by all

 

sorts of fluctuations, and yet, beginning from a certain moment, continuous and constant in its

 

spirit, in its successive directions....” And opposing 

the writer or the man, 

“dreamer and

 

timid,” to the work which “lives with an independent life,” moving by “its intrinsic

 

properties” and “quite charged with revolutionary explosives,” leading equally to “anarchy,”

 

and “social despotism,” Lanson concludes: “We must not try to hide this contrast of man and

 

work, which may even be called contradiction; for that is Rousseau himself.” Is it still

 

necessary to specify that what interests us in Rousseau, and here in Lanson, is the obstinate

 

veiling of this “critical” unveiling of the “contra-diction” between the man and the work?

 

Allowing us the concession of a certain internal contradiction, what is hidden from us under

 

this “Rousseau himself?” Where and when is one assured that there would have to be

 

something that fits the proposition “that is Rousseau himself?”

31.That was Lanson’s opinion as well and he finally came to agree with Masson.

32.”Note, in particular, that the long note to Chapter.7 was added and that the entire Chapter 6

 

[‘Whether It Is Likely That Homer Knew How to Write’] was considerably revised. In the

 

first draft, Rousseau thought it very probable that Homer did not know writing (pp. 29–30 of

 

the manuscript) . Rereading his text, he struck out that passage and added in the margin: ‘N.

 

B. This is a stupidity that one must avoid, since the story of Bellerophon, in the 

Iliad 

itself,

 

proves that the art of writing was in use in the author’s time, but this would not prevent his

 

work from being more sung than written’ “ (Masson’s Note. The examination of the

 

manuscript seemed less fruitful to me than Masson seems to think).

33.”I am publishing the final text at which Rousseau seems provisionally to have stopped, for

 

the Preface remains unfinished. . . . This Preface had already been published by A. Jansens, in

 

his J.-J. 

Rousseau als Musiker 

(Berlin 1884), pp. 472–73, but with many lacunae and faults of

 

reading which characterize most of his publications of texts” (Extract from Masson’s notes) .

34.Here is a passage that relates to the distinction between animal and human languages,

 

which the 

Essay 

equates with the distinction between non-perfectibility and perfectibility:

 

“That single distinction would seem to be far-reaching. It is said to be explicable by organic

 

differences. I would be curious to see such an explanation” (end of Chapter I) [p. ro].

35.Is it useful to indicate here that we find the same problematics of example and a literally

 

identical formulation in 

The Critique of Practical Reason, 

certainly, but above all in the

 

Metaphysische An f angsgründe der Tugendlehre 

(1797) [translated as 

The Principles of

 

Virtue: Part II of The Metaphysics of Morals, 

by James Ellington (New York, 1964)], which

 

distinguishes between the example as the particular case of a prac

tical rule 

(Exempel) 

and the

 




example as the particular instance of the purely “theo

retical presentation of a concept

 

(Beispiel)” 

(S52 [p. 148]), and in the notes to

((345))

Pedagogik 

[translated as 

The Educational Theory of Immanuel Kant, 

by Edward Frank-lin

 

Buchner (Philadelphia, 1908) ], published in 1803?

36.”Mons. Rameau, insisting absolutely, in his system, that all our harmony should be drawn

 

from nature, has had recourse, for this purpose, to another experience of his own invention. . .

 

. But first, the experience is false. . . . Though we should suppose the truth of this experience,

 

this would be very far from removing the difficulties. If, as Mons. Rameau pretends, the

 

whole of harmony is derived from the resonance of a sonorous body, it does not then derive

 

from it the single vibrations of a sonorous body which does not resound. In effect, it is a

 

strange theory to derive from what does not resound, the principles of harmony; and it is

 

strange in physic, to make a sonorous body vibrate and not resound, as if the sound itself was

 

at all different from the air, shaken by these vibrations” [pp. 343-44].

37.Cf., for example, 

The Confessions, 

p. 334 [pp. 343-44].

38.”When we reflect, that of all the people of the earth, who all have a music and an air, the

 

Europeans are the only ones who have a harmony and concords, and who find this mixture

 

agreeable; when we reflect, that the world has continued so many years, without, amongst the

 

cultivation of the beaux arts throughout mankind in general, any one’s having known this

 

harmony; that no animal, no bird, no being in nature, produces any other concord than the

 

unison, no other music than melody; that the eastern languages, so sonorous, so musical; that

 

the Greek air, so delicate, so sensible, exercised with so much art, have never guided these

 

voluptuous people, fond of our harmony, that without it, their music had such prodigious

 

effects, that with it, ours is so weak; that lastly, if it was reserved for the northern nations,

 

whose rough and brutal organs are more touched with the eclat and noise of the voice, than

 

with sweetness of the accent, and the melody of the inflections, to make this vast discovery,

 

and to give it as a foundation of all the rules in art: When I say, we pay attention to the whole

 

of this, it is very difficult not to suspect that all our harmony is but a gothic and barbarous

 

invention, which we should never have followed if we had been more sensible of the true

 

beauties of art, and of music truly natural. Mons. Rameau, however, pretends that harmony is

 

the source of the greatest beauties in music; but this opinion has been contradicted by facts

 

and reason.—By facts, because all the great effects of music have ceased, and it has lost all its

 

energy and force since the invention of the counter point; to which I add, that beauties purely

 

harmonic, are ingenious beauties, which please only persons versed in the art; whereas the

 

true beauties of music, being those of nature, are, and ought to be, equally sensible to every

 

man, whether learned or ignorant.

“

By reason, because harmony furnishes no imitation by which music, forming images, or

 

expressing sentiments, may be raised to the dramatic or imitative genus, which is the most

 

noble part of art, and the only one energetic. Every thing that expresses only the physic of

 




sounds, being greatly bounded in the pleasure which it gives us, and having very little power

 

over the human heart” 

(Dictionary) [pp. 

191-92].

Let us note in passing that Rousseau admits to two things that he elsewhere denies: 1. That the

 

beauties of music are natural; 2. that there is an animal song, a song merely melodic, to be

 

sure, but consequently absolutely pure. Thus the meaning and function of the contradiction

 

within the handling of the concepts of nature and ani

mality are confirmed: music, for

 

example, does not become what it is—human—and does not transgress animality except

 

through what threatens it with death: harmony.

39.Chapter 13, “On Melody,” is almost entirely given over to painting. We must cite this

 

remarkable page in extenso. Now more than ever, it is possible to comment on its irony in

 

more than one sense: “Imagine a country in which no one has any idea of drawing, but where

 

many people who spend their lives combining and mixing various shades of color are

 

considered to excel at painting. Those people would regard our painting precisely as we

 

consider Greek music. If they heard of the emotions aroused in us by beautiful paintings, the

 

spell of a pathetic scene, their scholars would rush into a ponderous investigation of the

 

material, comparing their colors to ours, determining whether our green is more delicate or

 

our red more brilliant. They would try to find out which color combinations drew tears, which

 

could arouse anger. The Burettes of that

((346))

country would examine just a few tattered scraps of our paintings. Then they would ask with

 

surprise what is so remarkable about such coloring.

“

And, if a start were made in a neighboring country toward the development of line and

 

stroke, an incipient drawing, some still imperfect figure, it would all be treated as merely

 

capricious, baroque daubing. And, for the sake of taste, one would cling to this simple style,

 

which really expresses nothing, but brilliantly produces beautiful nuances, big slabs of color,

 

long series of gradually shaded hues, without a hint of drawing.

“

Finally, the power of progress would lead to experiments with the prism. And immediately

 

some famous artist would base a beautiful system on it. Gentlemen, he will tell you, true

 

philosophy requires that things be traced to physical causes. Behold the analysis of light;

 

behold the primary colors; observe their relations, their proportions. These are the true

 

principles of the pleasure that painting gives you. All this mysterious talk of drawing,

 

representation, figure, is just the charlatanry of French painters who think that by their

 

imitations they can produce I know not what stirrings of the spirit, while it is known that

 

nothing is involved by sensation. You hear of the marvels of their pictures; but look at my

 

colors” [pp. 53-54].

And Rousseau prolongs yet further the imaginary discourse of this foreigner who is in fact

 

nothing other than the correspondent—foreigner and theoretician of painting—of a French

 

musician and musicographer, Rameau’s analogue. “French painters, he would continue, may

 

have seen a rainbow. Nature may have given them some taste for nuance, some sense of color.

 




But I have revealed to you the great and true principles of art. I say of art! of all the arts,

 

gentlemen, and of all the sciences. The analysis of colors, the calculation of prismatic

 

refractions, give you the only exact relations in nature, the rule of all relations. And

 

everything in the universe is nothing but relations. Thus one knows everything when one

 

knows how to paint; one knows everything when one knows how to match colors.

“

What are we to say to a painter sufficiently devoid of feeling and taste to think like that,

 

stupidly restricting the pleasurable character of his art to its mere mechanics? What shall we

 

say of a musician, similarly quite prejudiced, who considers harmony the sole source of the

 

great effect of music. Let us consign the first to housepainting and con

demn the other to doing

 

French opera” [p. 55].

40.It is in that passage of the first book which explains how “in this manner I learnt to covet

 

in silence, to dissemble, to lie, and, lastly, to steal” (p. 32) [p. 30]. For various reasons the

 

following passage, coming a little before the above, appears to me to be worth rereading at

 

this point: “The trade in itself was not disagreeable to me: I had a decided taste for drawing;

 

the handling of a graving-tool amused me; and as the claims upon the skill of a watchmaker’s

 

engraver were limited. I hoped to attain per

fection. I should, perhaps, have done so, had not

 

my master’s brutality and excessive restraint disgusted me with my work. I stole some of my

 

working hours to devote to similar occupations, but which had for me the charm of freedom. I

 

engraved medals for an order of knighthood for myself and my companions. My master

 

surprised me at this contraband occupation, and gave me a sound thrashing, declaring that I

 

was training for a coiner, because our medals bore the arms of the Republic. I can swear that I

 

had no idea at all of bad, and only a very faint one of good, money. I knew better how the

 

Roman 

As 

was made than our three-sou pieces” [p. 30].

41.The closest reference here leads to Condillac. Cf. the chapter “On the Origin of Poetry,” in

 

An Essay on the Origin of Human Knowledge 

(1756) .

46.With regard to the oratorical intonation which “modifies the very substance of discourse,

 

without perceptibly altering prosodic accent,” Duclos concludes: “In writing we mark

 

interrogation and surprise; but how many movements of the soul, and conse

quently how many

 

oratorical inflections, do we possess, that have no written signs, and that only intelligence and

 

sentiment may make us grasp! Such are the inflections that mark anger, scorn, irony, etc.,

 

etc.” 

(p. 416).

Essay

la théorie du devenir de l’entendement au XVIIIe siècle,”

Oct., 19661: 75.

49.In its elements at least, this argument does not belong to Rousseau. It owes a great deal

 

particularly to Condillac’s 

Essay on the Origin of Human Knowledge 

(the first section on

 

“The Origin and Progress of Language”). Through Condillac, we are also brought back to

 

Warburton (op. cit.). Probably also to the 

Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et la .peinture 

of

 

the abbé Du Bos ([Paris,] 1719) notably to Chapter 35 on the origin of languages, and to the

 

Rhétorique [ou l’Art de Pdrler, 

third edition (Paris, 1688) ] of Father Lamy who is cited

 

elsewhere in the 

Essay. 

On these problems, we refer to the 

Pléiade 

edition of the second

 

Discourse 

by J. Starobinski (especially to p. 151, n. 1) and to his fine analysis of the theme of

 

the sign in 

La transparence et l’obstacle

(pp. 169 f.) .

50. With regard to the “natural language” of the child: “To the language of intona

tion [voix] is

 

added the no less forcible language of gesture. The child uses, not its weak hands, but its

 

face” 

(Emile, 

p. 45; italics added) [p. 32].

51.”Psychonanalysis will tell us that in dreams dumbness is a common representa

tion of

 

death” (Freud, “The Theme of the Three Caskets,” 

[SE 

XII, 295; GW X, 24—37]. Rousseau

 

too says in the 

Reveries 

that silence “offers us an image of death” (p.1047).

52.One finds all these examples once again, and presented in related terms, in Book 4 of

 

Emile. 

It is a praise of the economy of speech in the eloquence of antiquity: “The most

 

startling speeches were expressed not in words but in signs; they were not uttered but shown.

 

A thing beheld by the eyes kindles the imagination, stirs the curiosity, and keeps the mind on

 

the alert for what we are about to say, and often enough the thing tells the whole story.

 

Thrasybulus and Tarquin cutting off the heads of the poppies, Alexander placing his seal on

 

the lips of his favourite, Diogenes marching before Zeno, do not these speak more plainly

 

than if they had uttered long orations? What flow of words could have expressed the ideas as

 

clearly?” (p. 40iß) [p. 287].

53.This story, which all great works on writing recall, comes to us from Clement of

 

Alexandria and Herodotus. Rousseau had perhaps read it in Warburton’s 

The Essay on

 

Hieroglyphs: 

“The story is told by 

Clemens Alexandrinus 

in these Words: 

It is said that

 

Idanthura, 

a King of the 

Scythians, 

as 

Pherecydes Syrius 

relates it, when ready to oppose

 

Darius, 

who had passed the 

Ister, 

sent the 

Persian 

a Symbol instead of Letters, namely, a

 

Mouse, a Frog, a Bird, a Dart and a Plow. 

Thus this Message being to supply both 

Speech

 




and Writing 

the Purport of it was, we see, expressed by a Com

position of 

Action 

and 

Picture”

 

[p. 87]. Warburton recalls Herodotus’s interpretation (I.IV) : “Darius believed that the

 

Scythians wanted to tell him through this enigma that they presented him earth and water, and

 

submitted to him. The mouse signified the earth to those in the know; the toad signified water;

 

the bird could be compared to the horse; and by the arrows was meant that they were

 

denuding themselves of their power. But Gobrias, one of those who destroyed the Magi, gave

 

another interpretation: ‘If instead of fleeing like birds, you hide yourself in the earth or water,

 

like mice and toads, you will perish by 

these 

arrows.’ For Herodotus, in place of one barb,

 

counts five arrows and says nothing of the plough, etc. . . . I believed I would please the

 

reader by adding this commentary of Herodotus to Pherecydes’ text” (pp. 63—65) [my edition

58.Although it further sharpens the break between the state of pure Nature and the state of

 

budding society, the 

Discourse 

multiplies quite a few allusions to “the incon

ceivable pains

 

and the infinite space of time that the first invention of languages must have cost” (p. 146) [p.

 

174], to “the rapidity of time,” to the “almost insensible prog

ress of things in their

 

beginnings”; “for the slower the events were in their succession, the more rapidly may they be

 

described” (p. 167) [p. 195]. A remark that Voltaire found “ridiculous.” See editor’s note in

 

the Pléiade edition.

59.Rousseau is more specific in a note: “It is not possible to determine the precise degree of

 

man’s natural indolence. It is said that he lives only to sleep, to vegetate, to rest. Only with

 

difficulty can he resolve to bestir himself enough to avoid dying of starvation. Nothing

 

sustains the love of so many savages for their mode of life as does this delicious indolence.

 

The feelings that make man restless, foresighted, and active arise only in society. To do

 

nothing is the primary and the strongest passion of man after that of self-preservation. If one

 




looks carefully, he will see that, just as among our-selves, it is in order to achieve repose that

 

everyone works. It is laziness that even makes us hard-working” [pp. 38-39, n. 4].

60. Derathé has qualified it thus 

(Rousseau et la science . . . , 

p. 18o).

62.If the force of dispersion can appear before and after the catastrophe, if the catastrophe

 

reunites men at the time of its appearance but disperses them anew by its persistence, the

 

coherence of the theory of need, under its apparent contradictions, is explained. Before the

 

catastrophe, need draws men apart; during the catastrophe, it brings them together. 

“The earth

 

nourishes men; but when their initial needs have dispersed them, other needs arise which

 

reunite them, and it is only then that they speak, and that they have any incentive to speak. In

 

order to avoid contradicting myself, I must be allowed time to explain myself” 

[Essay, 

p. 39].

Essays: 

“The cycles of the seasons are another more general and permanent cause that is

 

bound to produce the same effect in the climates subject to this variety” [p. 40]. 

Fragment 

on

 

climates: “A different diversity that multiplies and combines the preceding is that of the

 

seasons. Their succession, containing several climates alternately within a single one,

 

accustoms men who live there to their diverse impressions, and renders them capable of

 

traveling and living in all countries of which the temperature is felt in theirs” (p. 531) .

64.This description of the festival should be compared to that in the 

Letter to d’Alembert 

and,

 

more specifically as far as time is concerned, to that in 

Emile. 

“We will be our own servants in

 

order to be our own masters. Time will fly unheeded” [p. 318]. A very brief passage will lead

 

us to the understanding that these two notations are not juxtaposed: the possibility of the

 

“comparison,” in the sense given to that concept by Rousseau, is the common root of temporal

 

difference (which permits the measurement of time and throws us outside of the present) and

 

of the difference or lack of symmetry between master and man.

66. As long as incest is permitted, there is no incest, to be sure, but there is also no amorous

 

passion. Sexual relationships limit themselves to the reproductive needs; or they do not exist

 

at all: this is the situation of the child as given in 

Emile. 

But would Rousseau say the same

 

thing about the child’s relationship with his mother as he says here about his relationship with

 

his sister? It is true that the mother is quite absent from 

Emile: 

“The child brought up in

 

accordance with his age is alone. He knows no attach-ment but that of habit, he loves his

 




sister like his watch, and his friend like his dog. He is unconscious of his sex and his species;

 

men and women are alike unknown” (p. 256) [p. 18o].

Part 

II: 

Chapter 4

1.”It has often occurred to me in skeptical moments not only that Homer knew how to write,

 

but that he wrote in the manner of his time. I am very sorry if this doubt is formally

 

contradicted by the story of Bellerophon in the 

Iliad” 

[p. 23]. Subsequently engaged in

 

denying the significance, that is to say the authenticity, of the Bellerophon episode, Rousseau

 

pays no attention to its meaning: that the only piece of writing in Homer was a letter of death.

 

Bellerophon unwittingly carried on himself the inscription of his own death sentence. Within

 

an infinite chain of representations, desire carries death via the detour of writing. “Beautiful

 

Anteia the wife of Proitos was stricken/With [illicit] passion to lie in love with him

 

[Bellerophon, Glaucus’ son].” Unsucccessful, she threatens her husband: “Would you be

 

killed, O Proitos? Then murder Bellerophontes/ Who tried to lie with me in love, though I was

 

unwilling.” The king, representing Anteia’s desire, dare not kill with his own hands. He does

 

dare to write, and deferring murder, he traces with his hand “in a folding tablet” in

 

“murderous symbols” 

(thymophthora—[”passion-wasting”]) 

[the passages from the 

Iliad 

are

 

taken from the Richmond Lattimore translation (Chicago, 1951), p. 157.] He sends

 

Bellerophon to Lycea, charging him with these “fatal signs.” Reading this message, illegible

 

to Bel

lerophon, Proitos’s father-in-law, reigning at Lycea, will understand that it speaks of

 

putting the carrier of these “symbols” to death. In his turn, he defers the murder, sends

 

Bellerophon to risk death through killing the invincible Chimaera or the famous Solymes, and

 

lays ambushes for him. To no end. He finishes by giving him his daughter. Later, Bellerophon

 

is no longer loved by the gods and he goes alone, wandering “the plain of Aleios, eating his

 

heart out, skulking aside from the trodden track of humanity” (Lattimore, pp. 157—58)

2.Vico says that he understood the origin of languages at the moment when, after many

 

difficulties, it appeared to him that the first nations “were nations of poets; by the same

 

principles, we first identified the true origin of languages” 

(Scienza Nuova, 

I: 174). The

 

distinction among three languages would correspond, 

mutatis mutandis, to 

Rous

seau’s

 

schema; the second language, which marks the appearance of both speech and metaphor,

 

would, strictly speaking, be the moment of origin, when the poetic song is not yet broken into

 

articulation and convention. Let us compare: “Three kinds of language were spoken which

 

compose the vocabulary of this Science: (1 ) that of the time of the families when gentile men

 

were newly received into humanity. This, we shall find, was a mute language of signs and

 

physical objects having natural relations to the ideas they wished to express. (2) That spoken

 

by means of heroic emblems, or similitudes, comparisons, images, metaphors, and natural

 

descriptions, which make up the great body of the heroic language which was spoken at the

 

time the heroes reigned. (3) Human language using words agreed upon by the people, a

 

language of which they are absolute lords” (3, 1, p. 32) [Bergin, op. cit., p. 18]. Elsewhere:

 

“That first language ... was not a language in accord with the nature of the things it dealt with

 

. . . but was a fantastic speech making use of physical substances endowed with life and most

 

of them imagined to be divine” (3, 1, p. 163) [pp. 114—15]. “We find that the principle of

 

these

((350))

origins both of languages and of letters lies in the fact that the early gentile peoples, by a

 

demonstrated necessity of nature, were poets who spoke in poetic characters. This discovery,

 




which is the master key of this Science, has cost us the persistent research of almost all our

 

literary life” 

(3, Idea of the Work, 

I: 28–29) [p. 19]. “Men vent great passions by breaking into

 

song, . . . that . . . they were inexpressive save under the impulse of violent passions—[lead to

 

the conjecture that] their first languages must have been formed in singing” (3, I: 95 [J.-B.

 

Vico, 

Oeuvres choisies], 

tr. [J.] Chaix-Ruy [Paris, 1946]) [p. 69]. “All that has been reasoned

 

out seems clearly to confute the common error of the grammarians, who say that 

prose speech

 

came first and speech in verse afterward. 

And within 

the origins of poetry, 

as they have here

 

been disclosed, we have found 

the origins of languages and letters” 

(Book II, 

Poetic Wisdom,

 

Chap. 

V, S 5, 

[Oeuvres choisies de Vico,] 

tr. [J.] Michelet [(Paris, 1893-99), vol. 27,] (p. 430)

 

[p. 142]. 

For Vico, as for Rousseau, the progress of language follows the progress of

 

articulation. Thus, language suffers a fall and humanizes itself through the loss of its poetry

 

and its divine character: “The language of the gods was almost entirely mute, only very

 

slightly articulate; the language of the heroes, an equal mixture of articulate and mute, . . . the

 

language of men, almost entirely articulate and only very slightly mute” (3, I : 178, tr. Chaix-

Ruy) [p. 134].

3.Condillac recognized the convergence of his and Warburton’s thoughts, rather than his debt

 

to the latter. Yet this convergence, as we shall immediately see, is not com

plete: “This section

 

was near finished, when I happened to light on an essay on hieroglyphics, extracted from the

 

second volume of Dr. Warburton’s Divine Legation of Moses; a work equally distinguished

 

for strength of reasoning and variety of erudition. With pleasure I found that this author’s

 

notions and mine coincided, in supposing that language must, from its first beginning, have

 

been very figurative and metaphysical. My own reflections had led me to observe, that writing

 

at first could be no more than a simple picture; but I had not as yet made any attempt to

 

discover by what progress mankind arrived at the invention of letters, and it seemed difficult

 

to me to succeed in the inquiry. The task has been exceedingly well executed by Dr.

 

Warburton, of whom the greatest part of this chapter has been borrowed” (Chap. 13, “Of

 

Writing,” S 127, p. 177) [p. 273 n.].

4.Page 195. “This way of 

Speaking 

by 

Simile, 

we may conceive to answer to the 

Chinese

 

Marks 

or Characters in 

Writing; 

and as from such Marks proceeded the abbreviated Method

 

of 

Alphabetic Letters, so 

from the 

Similitude, 

to make Language still more expedite and

 

elegant, came the METAPHOR; which is indeed but a 

Simili

tude 

in little: For Men so

 

conversant in matter still wanted sensible Images to convey abstract Ideas” 

(Essai sur les

 

hiéroglyphes, 

T.I, pp. 85–86) [p. 94]. “This, and not the Warmth of a Poetic Fancy, as is

 

commonly supposed, was the true Original of figurative Expression. We see it even at this

 

Day in the Style of the 

American 

Barbarians, tho’ of the coldest and most flegmatic

 

Complexions. . . . Their 

Phlegm 

could only make their Stile 

concise, 

not take away the

 

Figures: 

and the Conjunction of these different Char

acters in it, shews plainly that Metaphors

 

were from Necessity, not Choice. . . . Thus we see it has ever been the way of Man, both in

 

Speech 

and 

Writing, 

as well as in 

Clothes 

and 

Habitations, 

to turn his Wants and Necessities

 

into Parade and Ornament” (PP. 195–97) [PP. 147-48].

5.METAPHORE, S. F. (gram.). “M. du Marsais says that it is a figure by which the proper

 

signification of a noun (I would prefer to say 

a word) is 

carried over, so to speak, to another

 

signification which is not appropriate to it except by virtue of a compari

son which is in the

 

mind. A word taken in its 

metaphoric 

sense loses its proper significa

tion, and acquires a new

 

one that presents itself to the mind only by the comparison undertaken between the proper

 

meaning of the word and what one compares it to: for example, when one says that falsehood

 

often decks itself in the colors of truth.” And after long quotations from Marsais: “I have

 




sometimes heard M. du Marsais reproached for being a little prolix; and I realize that it is

 

possible, for example, to give fewer ex-amples of 

metaphor, 

and to develop them less

 

extensively; but who has no wish at all for such a happy prolixity? The author of a dictionary

 

of language cannot read this article

((351))

on the metaphor without being struck by the astonishing exactitude of our grammarian in

 

distinguishing the proper meaning from a figurative one, and in assigning to one the

 

foundation of the other.”

6.On this point, Rousseau’s doctrine is most Cartesian. It is itself interpreted as a justification

 

of Nature. The senses, which are natural, never deceive us. On the contrary, it is our judgment

 

that misleads us and plays Nature false. “Nature never deceives us; we deceive ourselves”—a

 

passage from 

Emile 

(p. 

237) 

[p. 166] which the autograph manu-script replaces with the

 

following: “I say it is impossible for our senses to deceive us because it is always true that we

 

feel what we feel.” The Epicureans are praised for having recognized this but criticized for

 

having maintained that “the judgments that we made about our sensations were never false.”

 

“We sense our sensations, but we do not sense our judgments.”

7.Here again we are reminded of a Viconean text: “The poetic characters, in which the

 

essence of the fables consists, were born of the need of a nature incapable of ab

stracting forms

 

and properties from subjects. Consequently they must have been the manner of thinking of

 

entire peoples, who had been placed under this natural necessity in the times of their greatest

 

barbarism. It is an eternal property of the fables always to magnify the ideas of particulars. On

 

this there is a, fine passage in Aristotle’s 

Ethics 

in which he remarks that men of limited ideas

 

erect every particular into a maxim. The reason must be that the human mind, which is

 

indefinite, being constricted by the vigor of the senses, cannot otherwise express its almost

 

divine nature than by thus mag

nifying particulars in imagination. It is perhaps on this account

 

that in both the Greek and the Latin poets the images of gods and heroes always appear larger

 

than those of men, and that in the returned barbarian times the paintings particularly of the

 

Eternal Father, of Jesus Christ and of the Virgin Mary are exceedingly large” 

(Scienza Nuova,

 

3, 

II: 18, tr. Chaix-Ruy) 

[p. 279].

8.II.I, pp. 111–12 [pp. 

168, 

171]. This is also Warburton’s procedure in the re

markable

 

paragraphs that he devotes to the “Origin and Progress of Language” (I: 48 f.) [pp. 81 f.].

 

Thus: “In judging only from the nature of things, and without the surer aid of revelation, one

 

should be apt to embrace the opinion of Diodorus Siculus (lib.ii) and Vitruvius (lib.ii, cap.I)

 

that the first men lived for some time in woods and caves, after the manner of beasts, uttering

 

only confused and indistinct sounds, till, associating for mutual assistance, they came, by

 

degrees, to use such as were articulate, for the arbi

trary signs or marks, mutually agreed on, of

 

those ideas in the mind of the speaker, which he wanted to communicate to others. Hence the

 

diversity of languages; for it is agreed on all hands that speech is not innate.” And yet,

 

“nothing being more evident from scrip-ture, than that language had a different original. God,

 

we there find, taught the first man religion; and can we think he would not, at the same time,

 

teach him language?” [Con

dillac, p. 170].

9.II.I. 

2, 3, 

p. 113 

[pp. 

172–73]. We have italicized only “frightened” and “mimicked.” The

 

same examples are reconsidered in the chapter on “The Origin of Poetry:” “For example, in

 




the mode of speaking by action, to give an idea of a person that had been frightened, they had

 

no other way than to mimic the cries and natural signs of fear” (S 

66, p. 

148) 

[pp. 227–28].

10. “Every object at first received a particular name without regard to genus or species, which

 

these primitive originators were not in a position to distinguish; . . . so that, the ,narrower the

 

limits of their knowledge of things, the more copious their dic

tionary must have been. . . . Add

 

to this, that general ideas cannot be introduced into the mind without the assistance of words,

 

nor can the understanding seize them except by means of propositions. This is one of the

 

reasons why animals cannot form such ideas or ever acquire that capacity for self-

improvement 

[perfectibilité] 

which depends on them. . . . We must then make use of [ . . .]

 

language 

[parler] 

in order to form gen

eral ideas. For no sooner does the imagination cease to

 

operate than the understanding proceeds only by the help of words. If then the first inventors

 

of speech could give names only to ideas they already had, it follows that the first substantives

 

could be nothing more than proper names”

149-50. See also the editor’s notes) [pp. 1

exercise upon each other. “To explain this mutual Influence in the Manner it deserves, would

 

require a just Volume” (p. 202) 

[Warburton,

Judaeo-Christian model he replies—“Yes and no.” (p. 30).

16.As for this monogeneticism and the economic rationality of this genealogy, Con

dillac’s

 

prudence has limits, although the 

Traité des systèms 

(1749) is careful enough (Chap. 17) : “If

 

all the characters in use since the origin of history could have come down to us with a key

 

which would explain them, we would disentangle this progress in a sensible manner. With

 

those that are extant, however, we can develop this system, if not in all its detail, at least

 

sufficiently so as to assure us of the generation of the dif

ferent types of script. M. Warburton’s

 

work is a proof of this” (Cf. 

DE, 

p. 1oi) .

relationships among writing, the via rupta, and incest, cf.

(op. cit.)].

Speech and Phenomena

19.This final reappropriation of presence is most often named by Rousseau as an

 

anthropological telos: “Let man appropriate everything to himself; but what is important for

 

him to appropriate is man himself” (Manuscript of 

Emile). 

But as usual this anthropologism

 

essentially comes to terms with a theology.

20.Other examples of the mistrust that everything operating through writing in social and

 

political life inspired in Rousseau:—In Venice: “Here one is dealing with an invisible

 

government and always in writing, which requires great circumspection.” 2. —“In popular

 

estimation the Platonic Institution stands for all that is fanciful and unreal. For my own part I

 

should have thought the system of Lycurgus far more fanciful [chimérique] had he merely

 

committed it to writing” 

(Emile, 

p. 

1o) 

[p. 8] J. de Maistre will say: “What is most essential is

 

never written down and can in fact not be written down without exposing the state.”

21.This is the reason why Rousseau admits the necessity of representation even while

 

deploring it. 

See the 

Considérations sur le gouvernement de Pologne [The Govern-ment of

 

Poland, 

tr. 

Willmoore Kendall (New York, 1972) ]; there he proposes a very rapid turnover of

 

representatives in order to make their “seduction more costly and more difficult,” which is to

 

be related to the rule formulated by the 

Contract, 

according to which “often should the

 

Sovereign show himself” (p. 426) [p. 75]; cf. also Derathé, 

Rousseau et la science politique

 

de son temps 

(pp. 277 f.) .

What logic does Rousseau obey when he thus justifies the necessity of a representa

tion that he

 

simultaneously condemns? Precisely the logic of representation; the more it aggravates its

 

disease, the more representative it becomes, representation restores what it takes away: the

 

presence of the represented. A logic according to which one must force oneself “to draw from

 

the disease itself its own remedy” (Fragment on 

L’état de nature, 

p. 479) and according to

 

which, at the end of its movement, convention rejoins Nature, servitude liberty, etc. (“What

 

then? Is liberty maintained only by the help of slavery? It may be so. Extremes meet.”

Cf. also,

23.On the rebus, cf. supra, p. 136 [p. 90]. Vico who also distinguishes among three conditions

 

or steps of writing, gives as one example, among others, of primitive writing (ideographic or

 

hieroglyphic, “born spontaneously” and “not drawing its origins from conventions at all”) the

 

“rebus of Picardy” [p. 128]. “The second form of script is equally and completely

 

spontaneous: it is a symbolic or emblematically heroic script” (coats of arms, blazonry, “mute

 

comparisons which Homer calls 

semata, 

the signs in

((353))

which the heroes wrote” [p. 129]). “The third form of writing: alphabetic script” 

(Science

 

nouvelle, 

3, 1, pp. 61—62, 181—82, 194, tr. Chaix-Ruy) .

24.This is Duclos’s thesis: “Writing (I speak of the writing of sounds) was not born like

 

language through a slow and imperceptible progression: many centuries passed before it was

 

born; but it was born all at once, like light.” After having retraced the history of pre-alphabetic

 

scripts, Duclos appeals to that “stroke of genius” among lan

guages: “Such is Chinese writing

 

today, corresponding to ideas rather than to sounds; such are with us the signs of algebra and

 

Arabic numerals. Writing was in that condi

tion, with no relationship with today’s writing,

 




when a happy and profound genius sensed that discourse, however varied and extended in

 

terms of ideas, is yet com

posed of only a few sounds, and the point was merely to give each

 

of the latter a repre

sentative character. If one reflects upon this, one will see that this art, once

 

conceived, must have been formed almost simultaneously; and it is this that exalts the glory of

 

the inventor. . . . It was much easier to count all the sounds of a language, than to discover that

 

they could be counted. One was a stroke of genius, the other a simple result of at

tention” (op.

than representative signs of the material for which they have been ex-changed, have properly

 

speaking no absolute value.” “Since money has no real value by itself, it takes a value by tacit

 

convention in every country where it is in use . . .” (p. 520) and in. the 

Government of

 

Poland: 

“Money, in the last analysis, is not wealth, but merely the sign for wealth; and what

 

you must multiply is not the sign but rather the represented thing” (p. ioo8) [p. 73]. It is

 

precisely at the opening of Chapter 15 on “Deputies or Representatives” that 

The Social

 

Contract 

(Bk. III) condemns money as the power of servitude: “Make gifts of money, you will

 

not be long without chains” [p. 77].

Cf. also Starobinski, 

La transparence et l’obstacle, 

pp. 129 f. and the editors’ note 3 on p. 37

 

of vol. I of the Pléiade edition of the 

Confessions.

27.Cf. also the 

Projet de constitution Pour la Corse, 

pp. 911-12.

28.

Confessions, 

p. 237 [p. 245].

29.Garnier edition, p. 168 [p. 57]. Italics added.

30.Starobinski, 

La transparence, 

p. 119. I refer also to the entire chapter devoted to the fête (p.

 

114), which Starobinski opposes to the theatre as a 

“world of transparence” 

to a 

“world of

 

opacity.”

31.It is well-known that Rousseau ruthlessly denounced the mask, from the 

Letter to M.

 

d’Alembert 

to the 

Nouvelle Hiloise. 

One of the tasks of pedagogy consists pre

cisely in

 

neutralizing the effects of masks upon children. For let us not forget, “all chil

dren are afraid of

 

masks” 

(Emile, 

p. 43) [p. 30]. The condemnation of writing is also, as if self-evidently, an

 

ambiguous condemnation of the mask.

32.Among other analogies, by this distrust, with regard to the spoken text, of Cor

neille and

 

Racine who were nothing but “talkers” even though, “imitating the English,” they must

 

sometimes “place the stage itself within representation” 

(La Nouvelle Hélo

ise, 

p. 253) 

[Eloisa

 

II., p. 62]. But surely these reconciliations must be effected with the greatest caution. The

 

context sometimes places an infinite distance between two identi

cal propositions.

33.Page 226 [pp. 127—28]. One will relate to this the following passage from 

Emile: 

“but

 

when spring returns, the snow will melt and the marriage will remain; you must reckon for all

 

seasons” (p. 570) [p. 411].




34.Cf. also 

Emile, 

pp. 66—69 [pp. 46-48].

35.Rousseau dreams of an unarticulated language, but he describes the origin of languages as

 

the passage from the cry to articualtion. The consonant which for him goes hand in hand with

 

articulation, is the becoming-language of sound, the becoming-phonetic of natural sonority. It

 

is the consonant that gives the possibility of a linguistic pertinence to sound, by inscribing it

 

within an opposition. Jakobson has shown, against current prejudices, that “in the acquisition

 

of language, the first vocalic opposition is

((354))

posterior to the first consonantal oppositions; there is thus a stage when the consonants

 

already fulfill a distinctive function, whereas the unique vowel yet serves only as stress to the

 

consonant and as material for expressive variations. Thus we see the consonants acquiring

 

phonemic value before vowels” (“Les lois phoniques du langage enfantin et leur place dans la

 

phonologie générale,”
