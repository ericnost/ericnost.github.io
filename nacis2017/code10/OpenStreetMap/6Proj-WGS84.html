// Most spherical mercator maps use an extent of the world from -180 to 180 longitude, 
// and from -85.0511 to 85.0511 latitude. Because the Mercator Projection stretches to 
// infinity as you approach the poles, a cutoff in the north-south direction is required, and
// this particular cutoff results in a perfect square of projected meters. 
 
// “EPSG” identifiers for projections are managed by the European Petroleum Survey Group.
// EPSG took some time to warm to the system used by Google and others, but eventually, in
// mid-2008 they decided to add the system to their code registry, assigning it the code
// EPSG: 3785. There was a small fanfare among the spatial community, and people started 
// recoding the old 900913-hack code to use the new “official” code instead.

// As an aside, the projection was listed on the EPSG registry with an accompanying note
// reading “It is not a recognised geodetic system”.

// In 2009, the code was changed from 3785 to 3857.

// EPSG:3785 describes a Mercator projection of geographic coordinates defined on a 
// spherical model of the earth, of radius 6,378,137m

// There are only 2 possible projections with openlayers and they are defined with 
// “EPSG” codes, identifiers managed by the European Petroleum Survey Group.
// EPSG:4326 - WGS84
// EPSG:3857 - Spherical or Web Mercator
// officially registered EPSG code 3857 whose projection is identical to EPSG:900913
// older designation but still works EPSG:900913 - Spherical or Web Mercator
// older designation but still works EPSG:102113 - Spherical or Web Mercator

          center: [-96, 0],
