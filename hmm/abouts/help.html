<h3>How do I know how much waste a site imported as an amount, rather than a percent?</h3>
<p class = "help"> Hovering over a site highlights the percent of waste that that particular site imported (on the right side panel).  Clicking on the site displays a panel on the left showing the total kilograms or liters imported by that site, as well as where that site ranks among other importers.  </p>
<h3>What if I want to look at state information, rather than site information?</h3>
<p class = "help">On the left hand side of the screen, select ‘states’.  This will display a choropleth map showing the amount each state imported during the selected time period.  Hovering over a particular state will display the number of sites located in that state, as well as the amount of the selected waste (solid or liquid) imported by that state. </p> 
<h3>How do I find out what types of waste a particular site imported?</h3>
<p class = "help">Selecting a site displays a panel on the left that gives information about a given site, including the types of waste that site imported.  To find out more about a particular waste type, select ‘type’ on the right side panel, then select the desired waste type from the bar chart.  Information about that waste type will be displayed below.</p>
<h3>Well how about the reverse - how do I see all the sites that are importing a certain kind of waste?</h3>
<p class = "help">Select the “Type” option in the right side bar. The stacked bar chart will be reclassified in terms of waste types. By left clicking on the pieces of the bar chart, sites that import that type of waste will be color-coded to match on the map.
<h3> How do I find out how a particular site is disposing of the waste? </h3>
<p class = "help">Select ‘disposal’ on the right hand side.  Hover over the bar chart to get a feel for the different ways sites dispose of waste. Selecting one of the disposal types will highlight the sites that dispose of waste in that way.  Additionally, the panel at the right will give more detail about what that disposal method is.
<h3>Can I also look at demographic information along with the waste information?</h3>
<p class = "help">Yes.  Poverty and race data can be overlaid on the map by selecting ‘poverty’ or ‘race’ from the right side panel.  For site specific information, first select or search for the site of interest.  From the left side panel that opens, select the ‘demographics’ tab to obtain more detailed race and poverty information for that site. </p>   
<h3>Why is there liquid and solid waste?</h3>
<p class = "help">We maintain the separation between solid and liquid waste in HazMatMapper given ambiguity in conversions between different hazardous elements. While this distinction is useful for analysis of the dataset, it does not reflect the regulatory definition of hazardous waste, which hinges on different notions of “solid” (40 USC. Sec 261.2. 2012).</p>
<h3>Why are there liquid wastes under the solid category and vice versa?</h3>
<p class = "help"> Because people report things in volume vs. weight.</p>
<h3>What does N.O.S. mean?</h3>
<p class = "help"> The waste is not otherwise specified, so specific hazards are unknown</p>
<h3>Why are the circles for each site different sizes?</h3>
<p class = "help">The circles are proportional symbols, which are sized by the amount of waste imported or exported. Larger circles indicate sites that are importing more waste, in kilograms for solid waste and liters for liquid waste.
<h3>How do I find top importers/exporters?</h3>
<p class = "help">The proportional symbols (circles showing each site) are sized by the amount of waste (solid or liquid), so the largest circles import (or export) the most waste. The default option for stacked bar chart in the upper right corner is classed by site for the year(s) selected, starting with largest importers or exporters at the top and descending. You can also view importer or exporter ranks in the left side panel, below “Total imports and rank for selected year(s).”
<h3>How do I view the original data?</h3>
<p class = "help">Below the site address at the top of the left side panel, select “manifests.” A link to the original PDFs from which the data were compiled will appear.
