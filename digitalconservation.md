Project background

## Summary of research findings
We conducted three surveys to understand practices and perspectives on digital conservation: 1) We counted and correlated keywords on conservation technology-related websites and the websites of 69 conservation organizations; 2) We conducted a more traditional survey of 45 organizations across Canada and the US on their use of conservation technologies, their goals in using them, and the outcomes they’ve seen; 3) We ran what’s known as a Q-method survey with 10 individuals in the sector to characterize distinct ways of thinking about digital conservation. Additionally, we explored a case study digital conservation project, interviewing five key informants and reviewing primary materials. \

## Watershed Prioritization Using New Data Sources Lab
In this lab, you will learn how to employ GIS and modeling, social media/volunteered geographic information, and data dashboards in specific use cases – modeling landscapes, assessing recreational and other ecosystem services, and interactively prioritizing conservation investments. \

## Guelph's Informal Green Spaces Lab
This lab will help us to get to know two key conservation technologies – GIS and VGI  – through the context of an underexplored conservation issue: informally used greenspaces.  \
